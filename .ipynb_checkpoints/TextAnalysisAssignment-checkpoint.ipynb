       " '50 Best NBA players of 2022: Giannis leads the charge as injuries impact othersAs the season continues to heat up, the Best NBA players are rising to the top. Making big impacts. Let’s take a look at the top 50 so far:Note: The article was originally written by Jarrod Castillo, since updated by the Sportsnaut team.Consistency has obviously been an issue for the 20-year-old Edwards since Minnesota made him the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Despite this, the flashes this Georgia product has shown thus far in his career makes him a top-50 NBA player. The kid is averaging nearly 22 points per game as a sophomore and has seen both his effective field goal and three-point percentages increase a ton since his rookie campaign.The other half of the vaunted “Splash Bros.,” Thompson just returned to action after a two-year hiatus. While he’s been limited in minutes as the Warriors look to get him up to speed, we have not seen too much of a drop-off in production. The three-time champion is averaging 16.8 points, 3.9 rebounds and what would be a career-best 2.9 assists. He’s also shooting 35% from distance while continuing to play elite-level defense. We’re intrigued to see how Thompson looks once he’s playing his full 38 minutes per game (26.5 thus far).Acquired from Sacramento during February’s NBA trade deadline, Haliburton is among the best young point guards in the NBA. In limited action with the Pacers, he’s averaging 19.2 points to go with 9.5 assists while shooting 41% from three-point range. Having recently turned 22, he’s still not close to his prime. The sky is almost literally the limit for the Iowa State product.Related: NBA schedule and fantasy basketball picksA first-round pick of the Nets back in 2017, Allen displayed flashes of brilliance in Brooklyn before heading to Cleveland in the James Harden trade to open the 2020-21 season. Since joining the Cavaliers, he’s been an elite force for this up-and-coming squad. That includes Allen averaging 14.6 points and 10.3 rebounds on 64% shooting. He also ranks seventh in the NBA this season in win shares. That’s insane.One of the more surprising success stories from last season was Jerami Grant having a fantastic performance for the rebuilding Detroit Pistons. He very nearly nabbed the Most Improved Player award last season averaging career-highs in points, assists, and free throw percentage. While injuries have impacted Grant this season, he’s still one of the better two-way players in the game.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA Playoff and title predictions One of the most-underrated acquisitions during the 2020 offseason, Christian Wood proved to be a godsend for a Rockets team that will have to continue finding an identity moving forward. Wood had a tremendous breakout season last year and has since carried over that success into this season. He’s averaging 17.9 points and 10.1 rebounds. The question now is whether Wood fits in long-term with the Rockets after months of trade speculation.It was about this time last year that Collin Sexton was seen as the face of a rebuilding Cavaliers squad. Boy, how a calendar year changes things. Cleveland is a legit playoff contender back east and one of the most-surprising squads in the game. For his part, Garland just earned his first-ever All-Star appearance. For good reason. The former No. 5 pick from Vanderbilt is averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, field goal percentage and effective field goal percentage. Did we mention he’s only 22?In the latter half of last season, Miles Bridges began to show signs that he was ready to have a breakout year coming into this season. In his last 19 games of the year, he averaged 20.3 points shooting 52% from the field and 6.8 rebounds. Thus far this season, Bridges is averaging 19.9 points, 7.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists on 48.2% shooting this season.Pretty much the centerpiece in the trade that sent Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers ahead of the 2019-20 season, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has morphed into a star and leader for the rebuilding Thunder. It’s pretty darn shocking what we’ve seen him do thus far in OKC. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, SGA is averaging 23.8 points, 4.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists.Related: NBA MVP rankings for 2022 It’s going to be interesting to see how Simmons pans out in Brooklyn after the blockbuster trade from Philadelphia. He’s fallen down our list of the best NBA players big time after sitting out the entire season with the 76ers and following a disastrous playoff performance in 2020-21. Even then, we’re talking about one of the best defensive players in the game and a dude who can contribute big time. You don’t average 15.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.7 assists on 56% shooting over four seasons without being pretty good.De’Aaron Fox has proven himself to be among the best NBA players at the point guard position. That’s magnified by the fact Fox has improved in each of his four seasons. Unfortunately, the Sacramento Kings have not been in the postseason since 2006. With Fox’s numbers taking a big dip through 56 games and the Kings falling to 13th in the West, their chances of making it back to the playoffs are not likely.After a season in which he was named the NBA’s Most Improved Player leading to a well-deserved contract extension, Randle has seen his production decline big time. It led to some rumors heading into February’s NBA trade deadline. Since then, the forward has picked it up. Randle is averaging 26.1 points, 10.5 rebounds and 5.7 assists since the start of February. He’s coming around.While all of the buzz surrounding the New Orleans Pelicans is based around Zion Williamson, not enough is said about the player that Brandon Ingram has developed into. Ingram signed a max contract extension ahead of the 2020-21 campaign, Ingram is now continuing to play at a high level. So far this year, he is averaging 22.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists. With Williamson still sidelined to a knee injury, Ingram has taken over as the face of the franchise in NOLA.Ayton, 23, has morphed into one of the more reliable centers in the NBA. He’s doing so for a championship-contending Suns squad. Since the start of last season, he’s averaging 15.5 points and 10.2 rebounds on an otherworldly 63% shooting. The question now is whether Phoenix will award him with a max contract as a restricted free agent during the summer.The Milwaukee Bucks took a massive gamble in their blockbuster trade for Jrue Holiday. In the end, it paid off in droves for the Bucks as Holiday played a huge role in the team winning the NBA championship over the Phoenix Suns. Holiday gets a lot of respect around the league as one of the best perimeter defenders in the game today with even Kevin Durant praising his talents on JJ Redick’s podcast. His impact continues to be felt for Milwaukee as they are legit contenders to repeat in 2021-22.Former Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green may not get much recognition due in part to him not being a prolific scorer, but he is arguably one of the best playmaking bigs the NBA has to offer. He helped the Warriors to a hot start to the 2021-22 season before going down to a back injury. Put it this way. Golden State is 27-7 in the 34 games Green has played in this season. It’s a mere 17-16 when he sits.Since given the opportunity to be the full-time starter in Toronto, Pascal Siakam has shown that he is among the best power forwards in the league today. However, a torn labrum suffered late last season prevented him making a major impact early during the 2021-22 campaign. Boy, has Siakam turned it around since. He’s averaging 21.6 points, 8.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists on 48.1% shooting this season.A former No. 1 pick, the 26-year-old Towns has lived up to his end of the bargain on the offensive end. He’s having the best overall performance of his career this season, averaging 24.4 points, 9.8 rebounds and 3.8 assists. He’s also shooting 40.1% from distance while ranking in the top-10 in offensive win shares. That seems pretty good.In highly unfortunate fashion, Jamal Murray went down to a torn ACL 48 games into the 2020-21 season. That came after the 2019-20 NBA Playoff hero averaged 21.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists 41% from three-point range. Unfortunately for he and the Denver Nuggets, there is no timetable for his return depriving fans from seeing his and the team’s development.Related: 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year rankingsA throwback to bigs of the past, Nikola Vucevic has been slowly expanding his offensive game and it is paying dividends for a Chicago Bulls team that is on a fast rise to contention in the Eastern Conference. Vucevic has not truly been able to leave his mark on the Bulls so far this year though he is averaging a double-double with 18 points and 11.4 rebounds. He will get his chance to make more of an impact for Chicago moving forward.It’s not that Murray wasn’t a good player earlier in his career with San Antonio. Rather, it’s all about him taking his game to the next level since being the primary focus on offense. With DeMar DeRozan in Chicago, Murray has excelled in a lead role. He’s averaging 20.7 points to go with 8.4 rebounds and 9.3 assists while leading the league in steals at 2.1 per game. Murray ranks 17th in the NBA in defensive win shares and eighth in value over replacement. He’s a first-time All-Star. You do the math.Coming off a season in which he became the first Charlotte Hornet to win the Rookie of the Year since Emeka Okafor in 2005, Lamelo Ball has not become a victim of the sophomore slump so far. He is averaging 19.6 points, 7.3 assists and 6.9 rebounds. We’re talking about a first-time All-Star who is still only 20 years old. There’s a ton of untapped potential here.While Khris Middleton gets a bad reputation for being inconsistent, he is arguably one of the most underrated players in the NBA. After an eight-game absence due to health and safety protocols, Middleton has finally started to find his footing for the Bucks this season. For the season, he is averaging 20.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.4 assists. Though, Middleton’s shooting numbers are down from the previous six seasons. That has to be seen as concerning.An amazing defensive player, the “Stifle Tower” has shown that he can stop almost anyone at the rim. Gobert’s offense needs work if he is to stay on the court against smaller, faster teams. But as long as he plays his role, he’ll be fine. After a second straight playoff loss with the Utah Jazz, there’s some concern over Gobert’s relationship with star teammate Donovan Mitchell. It will be interesting to watch if Utah is booted from the postseason prematurely once again.Acquired by Sacramento in the blockbuster Tyrese Haliburton trade, Sabonis remains one of the most-skilled bigs in the game. The two-time All-Star is averaging 19.1 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists since the start of the 2019-20 campaign. Unfortunately, issues on defense keep Sabonis limited on our list of best NBA players right now.Probably the best ball-handler of all-time, Kyrie Irving’s mastery with a basketball is undeniable. He can score 50 or any given night and drop any defender that’s in front of him. He’s still sitting out home games due to New York’s COVID-19 mandates and has only suited up in 18 outings this season, but he may be allowed to return to the Barclays Center soon. When Irving is dialed in, he’s as dominant as they come.The 28-year-old Anthony Davis has been a two-way presence since being the first pick back in 2012. Davis has been criticized for not living up to expectations of being one of the top-10 players in the NBA. While his numbers don’t look bad on the surface averaging 23.1 points on 54% shooting, he’s now an injury-plagued enigma and has struggled to remain healthy consistently.Jaylen Brown has teamed up with Jayson Tatum to form an elite young wing duo in Boston. The former No. 3 pick has proven former GM Danny Ainge right in refusing to include him in trades for the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the past. After some struggles earlier this season, Brown has picked it up recently. He’s averaging 23.0 points and 6.2 rebounds on 45.9% shooting. Brown also remains a legitimate two-way threat, as his defense continues to improve on an annual basis.No longer just a dunker, LaVine has improved in almost every other facet of his game from his shooting averages to his per-game totals. Only 26, LaVine has a lot of time to improve other facets of his game to become one of the better all-around players in the NBA. In a year that could see him make the playoffs for the first time in his eight-year career, Lavine has gotten off to a good start averaging 24.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.5 assists.Related: Ranking 2021-22 NBA defensesSpeaking of max contract extensions, Bam Adebayo re-upped with the Heat as his talents continue to flourish in South Beach. Coming off a season in which the Miami Heat being bounced in the first round of the playoffs, they could be primed for a second NBA Finals in three years with a now revamped roster. Despite missing games to injury earlier this season, Bam has returned to be his dominant self.Since coming into the league in 2017, Mitchell has proven to be a fast-rising star in the NBA. The 25-year-old is a nightly 20-4-4 threat and even as the focal point in the offense, his percentages have stayed consistent in his three years in the league. If he’s able to keep producing, it’s not out of the equation that Mitchell will become a top-10 player.Maybe one of the best offensive players in NBA history, Harden has shown that he can lead a team as the No. 1 option on that end of the court. However, the aforementioned rule changes for “foul hunting” seem to have affected his performance. Now that Harden has joined Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, the hope is that he’s going to return to form. Time will tell on that front, but he looked sharp in his debut.Each year, Jayson Tatum continues to get better and better the more he plays the role of the number one option on offense for the Boston Celtics. The competition in the Eastern Conference is thicker than it’s been in a long time. Tatum is doing his very best to put Boston in strong playoff standing, averaging 26.8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 4.2 assists.No doubt one of the best clutch shot makers in recent history, the 31-year-old Damian Lillard definitely knows what time it is when it comes to the game clock. It’s “Dame Time.” Sadly, Lillard is likely lost for the remainder of the season to injury and saw his production decrease before being sidelined. He was averaging six-year lows in PPG, RPG and APG while shooting just 32% from distance. At 31, have we seen the best from Dame already?Even without a three-point shot, the 32-year-old Demar DeRozan has found a way to stay effective. An excellent mid-range shooter, he improved his rebounding and passing pretty much every season. Now a member of the Chicago Bulls after a blockbuster sign-and-trade, DeRozan has played a major role in the team being a contender in the Eastern Conference going forward currently leading the team in scoring with 28.1 points on 50.9% shooting. He also ranks ninth in win shares and fourth in offensive win shares. That’s enough for DeRozan to jump way up the board in our most-recent best NBA players list.After leading the Memphis Grizzlies to their first postseason since 2017, Ja Morant looks to take his team to the next level with a fantastic effort again this season. He is averaging 27.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 6.7 assists. He also has Memphis with the second-best record in the Association at 46-22.One of the few truly elite two-way players in the league, George is a terror on both ends of the court. He can drop 20-25 points on a nightly basis while also shutting down the opposing team’s best player. George earned a lot of people’s respect in the playoffs last season nearly leading the Clippers to the NBA Finals despite being without Kawhi Leonard for a large majority of Los Angeles’. Unfortunately, George currently joins Leonard in being sidelined to injury.The 32-year-old Butler seems to have finally found a home in Miami. Butler has embraced the Heat’s winning culture with great success thus far and that could lead be amplified this year as the Heat have a new and improved team thanks to a wealth of new additions. Butler has helped keep the Heat toward the top of the conference posting 21.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 1.8 steals with the Heat in sole possession of first place in the East.Arguably the most surprising team to start the season has been the Washington Wizards opening up the year with a 5-1 record. A huge reason for the teams’ success was the play of their dynamic guard Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, Beal is now lost for the remainder of the season with his future in D.C. firmly up in the air.Stardom. That’s what we saw from the 24-year-old Devin Booker during Phoenix’s shocking run to the NBA Finals last season. Booker is looking to build on what was a spectacular postseason with the difference this year being he will be the hunted not the hunter. Thus far for the star two-guard and Co., that has been the case. Booker has led this squad to an NBA-best 53-14 record. He’s also averaging north of 25 points per game while shooting 37.3% from distance.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA power rankings Chris Paul demonstrated that he still has gas left in the tank during an absolutely brilliant 2020-21 regular season for the Phoenix Suns. Paul is one of the best leaders the NBA has today and that was on full display during the Suns’ playoff run last season. As his career winds down, Paul will look to get Phoenix back to the promised land capturing the NBA championship that has eluded him. He has been a huge catalyst for the Suns success this season, ranking eighth in the NBA in win shares and seventh in defensive plus-minus.As we saw in the playoffs last year, Trae Young is shaping up to be the next shooter with limitless range. Trae is making a name for himself as not only a great shooter but one of the brightest stars in the league today. Not only that, but he is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast that allow him to flex his amazing playmaking skills. While things have not gone the best for the Hawks this season, Young’s earned another All-Star appearance and is a legit star out there.At only 22, Doncic is doing things for the Dallas Mavericks that haven’t been done since LeBron James. Since the start of his sophomore campaign, Doncic is averaging 28.2 points, 8.9 rebounds and 8.6 assists. He’s earned three consecutive All-Star appearances and is a downright dominant force on offense. This dude has Hall of Fame written all over him.Last season, Kawhi Leonard was a huge catalyst in the Los Angeles Clippers reaching their first Conference Finals in franchise history during last season’s playoffs.  Unfortunately, he was unable to reap the benefits of all his hard work as he was injured during the semifinal round forced to miss the rest of the playoffs due to a partially torn ACL. That news is bad enough but it could be even worse as it could force him to miss the entire 2021-2022 season. Hopefully this is not the case and we are able to see him back on the court prior to the start of the 2022 playoffs.Despite the Nets also having stars such as Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons, Kevin Durant proves he is among the best of the best every time he steps out on the court. Sadly, his season has been derailed by a sprained MCL in his knee that has caused the future Hall of Famer to miss time. In all, KD has missed 27 contests. How important is KD to the Nets? They are 8-19 in those 27 games. Brooklyn is 26-14 when Durant plays.LeBron James has been accused of being selfish because he has clearly found the fountain of youth but will not let his peers know where it is. He is now 37 years old and continues to show he has many, many years left in his career. LBJ has two 50-point games in his last three contests and is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.The often-injured Joel Embiid is now among the best NBA players in the game right now. That’s not hyperbole. We’re talking about the most-dominant big man since Dwight Howard was in his prime. Embiid has 24 30-point games since mid-December.Last season, Stephen Curry put up what might have been the best individual season of his career but it was not enough to lift the Golden State Warriors into the playoffs. This year, the Warriors have returned Klay Thompson from injury and continue to give Steph a strong supporting cast. Despite some recent struggles, the two-time NBA MVP is still averaging 25.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 6.4 assists on 37.8% shooting from distance. He’s also improved a whole heck of a lot on defense.A good argument could be made that reigning MVP Nikola Jokic has solidified himself as the best big man in the NBA today. The three-time All-Star is only 27 but is already making a name for himself as the most dynamic center the NBA has ever seen. He can easily put up 20-10 with seven assists as the focal point of the Nuggets’ offense. Jokic’s production has not stopped as he is averaging some ridiculous numbers in 2021-22 (26.1 PPG, 13.9 RPG, 8.1 APG).After an incredible performance in the 2021 NBA Finals, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to their first championship in 50 years, Giannis Antetokounmpo has shown no signs of letting off the gas during the 2021-2022 NBA season. He’s just as consistent and dominating as they come. Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, he’s averaging 28.3 points, 11.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists on 55% shooting. Yes, he’s the top NBA player right now and is still just 27 years old. Let that sink in.Share:  ',\n",
       " \"Top 100 NBA Players of 2022: And the Best Player Is ...Who will be the NBA’s best players in the 2021–22 season? Sports Illustrated‘s annual Top 100 list is back, aiming to answer that question.This year, the rankings were determined holistically by a panel of NBA writers—Chris Herring, Rohan Nadkarni, Michael Pina and Jeremy Woo—through a combination of data and subjective evaluation. (As far as the content of those discussions is concerned, consider the first rule of Fight Club.) The goal remains to evaluate players in a vacuum as much as possible, without overvaluing team context in taking stock of their quality.To be clear, these rankings are specifically for the upcoming season and do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2021-22. As has been the tradition here, rookies were not considered. So it’s best to consider these rankings as short-term value projections. This is not a representation of a player’s trade value or contract value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The possibility of growth or decline are factors, tied to players’ age and career stage. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact: offense, defense, structural or otherwise, and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill-sets.Availability due to injury and the ensuing recovery process are also factors here: this year, Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson were most affected in that way. The biggest snubs from this year’s list can be found here.For further reference, explore SI.com’s Top 100 lists from 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. SI’s Michael Shapiro, Ben Pickman and Wilton Jackson also contributed player profiles to this year's list. To listen to how the list was made: Listen to the Open Floor podcast. SI TOP 100: Read 100-51,\\xa050-31\\xa0and 30-11Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports10. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers\\xa0(Previous rank: 3)If 100% healthy heading into this season instead of nursing a torn ACL, Kawhi Leonard would’ve likely finished top three on this list. Before he churned through another robotically superb stretch of playoff basketball (during which he led the entire field with a 30.6 PER and, with the Clippers’ backs against the wall, turned out an iconic 45-point showpiece in Game 6 against the Mavericks), Leonard was his typically efficient self, barely missing entry into the 50/40/90 club by a hair. When healthy, his general adaptability is such a convenience. Leonard neatly fits in any lineup, playing any position, filling any role. It’d be wise to give him the ball and let him dictate every offensive possession, but he doesn’t need it in his hands to impact the game positively. He rebounds. He defends (extraordinarily well, still). He reigns over every square inch his wingspan allows him to with as much ferocity as anyone in the sport. Alas, Leonard may not play a minute this season, which complicates his placement on a list like this. But so long as he’s included, it doesn’t make much sense to drop anyone who soared as high as Leonard recently did out of the top 10. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated9. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 7)Davis fulfilled his potential\\xa0in the bubble\\xa0in 2020\\xa0with a dominant run that resulted in his first championship. He averaged 27.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, with a silly 66.5 true shooting percentage that, when combined with his versatility on defense, made him as valuable as any player on the planet. (The Lakers outscored opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions with Davis on the floor and were outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions when he sat, the widest differential on the team.)If he followed that stretch up with an entire season’s worth of similar production, Davis would in all likelihood rank No. 1 on this list. Instead, he had the most disappointing year of his career, with a statistical chasm unseen since his rookie year. Injuries played a role, as did an unprecedentedly brief offseason.His mid-range shot was inconsistent, albeit relied upon more than any other time since he was drafted. He took fewer shots at the rim and didn’t aggressively seek trips to the free throw line as frequently as someone so physically imposing probably should. The thing is: A down Davis year is still better than 99% of his contemporaries’ best. At only 28 years old, there’s no reason why he won’t bounce back. Generational talents tend not to lick their wounds for very long. — MPErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated8. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers(Previous rank: 10)When he is at his best, there is nobody in the league who can match up with Embiid. His combination of size, strength, power and touch is the antidote to the spacey style of modern basketball. Embiid is a dominant low force presence in a league continuously less familiar with those types of players. And in addition to his prowess on the block, last season Embiid turned in a stellar performance as a midrange shooter. The increase in efficiency from the midrange plus excising lazy threes led to the best scoring average and field-goal percentage of Embiid’s career. On the other end of the floor, Embiid’s presence in the paint all but guarantees a top-flight defense. Even if he’s not the type to switch onto guards, Embiid is still more than capable of sticking with smaller lineups—particularly when he’s in great shape. If there’s anything holding Embiid back from winning more individual accolades—and a higher spot on this list—it’s his health. Injuries are a persistent problem for Embiid, even if he was willing to battle through a torn meniscus during the Sixers’ most recent playoff run. On any given night, Embiid can be the best basketball player in the world. He’s a unique two-way force, and there’s still room for more once he finally plays on a roster optimized for him. — RNErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated7. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 4)Harden, when accounting for injuries and level of responsibility, is perhaps the most consistent volume scorer of his era. Even in 2021, when Harden averaged his fewest points since 2012, he remained one of the most feared scorers in the world. There is nuance to the way Harden collects his points despite his never ending quest for threes, layups and free throws. He’s deeply knowledgeable at using his body and leveraging his physicality to create space. Harden’s herky jerky movements are calculated, all part of a delicate dance to put his defender off balance. Harden’s footwork is so precise the moment he senses vulnerability he can pull into his shooting motion. Harden’s methods are undeniably effective. And in Brooklyn, he showed he didn’t have to rely on his scoring prowess to be effective. Harden earnestly took on the role of point guard for the Nets, and he delivered by racking up nearly 11 assists a night. Harden was a willing passer and table setter for a team that could let him isolate more comfortably than any one before it. If there’s a hole in Harden’s game, it’s on the defensive end, where he’s never been confused for a stopper. Still, his shortcomings there are a small price to pay for what else he brings to the table. Harden may never get a chance to prove he’s the proverbial “best guy on a championship team.” But if you pair him with anybody else in the top 20, you instantly have a contender. — RNGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated6. Luka\\xa0Dončić, Dallas Mavericks(Previous rank: 9)It stands to reason the 22-year-old\\xa0Dončić\\xa0may one day inherit the top spot on this list, as he continues on an all-time great trajectory. He’s prolific in every facet as a full-time offensive engine, with the size and pace to create mismatches in lieu of elite quickness, preternatural scoring know-how, and ingenious passing and processing speed. It’s not a bad bet that he may eventually average a triple-double … and he’s only been in the league for three seasons.The Mavericks are still working to build a championship-caliber core around\\xa0Dončić, and there are some areas of individual improvement to watch for in the interim. Despite taking a lot of difficult shots, he upped his three-point clip to a respectable 35% last season, which should trend up over time. He’s capable of better than 73% from the foul line, and he gets there plenty. Upping his efficiency along those margins, coupled with any reduction in turnovers (which are a byproduct of how often he has the ball) will take him to the stratosphere, statistically speaking. It seems foregone\\xa0Dončić\\xa0will eventually win an MVP regardless. The fact that nothing said here is exaggeration tells the story. He’s going to be here a long time. — JWWatch NBA games online all season long with fuboTV: Start with a 7-day free trial!Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Nikola\\xa0Jokić, Denver Nuggets(Previous rank: 8)For all the talk of the unicorn era in the NBA that never quite was, what exactly are you supposed to call\\xa0Jokić? Who was the last MVP who simply loved to pass and scored almost reluctantly all while flummoxing great players with his distinct lack of athleticism?\\xa0Jokić\\xa0is singular, and watching him play is one of the most fulfilling experiences for fans of fun basketball.Jokić\\xa0is a threat to get a triple double every night. He’s got brilliant touch as a shooter, allowing him to pop for threes on pick-and-rolls or pull up for little midrange Js near the elbow.\\xa0Jokić\\xa0doesn’t bulldoze people in the post. Instead, he prefers to attack with a flurry of moves before finding the perfect angle on the backboard while uncorking a shot from a comically awkward position. Of course, he’s a much better passer, keeping the Nuggets’ offense humming and constantly throwing players into open spots on the floor.\\xa0Jokić’s passing isn’t only aesthetically pleasing or some kind of nerd cred test; it’s genuinely a boon to Denver’s attack, allowing them to pick up buckets most other teams can’t.For years now,\\xa0Jokić\\xa0has been one of the most impactful offensive beings in the NBA. His defense will never be elite, though a decent enough one can be built around him. What matters more is that\\xa0Jokić’s rare set of skills not only continue to raise his own game to new heights, it raises those around him as well. — RNJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated4. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors(Previous rank: 5)No matter what happens next, Curry is going down as the most prolific shooter ever. He’s on pace to pass Ray Allen for the top spot on the career threes leaderboard, and sits a hair above Steve Nash for the best free throw percentage of all time. And he just put together the highest scoring average of his career, posting 32 points per game at age 32, while playing through injury. There’s essentially no assailing what Curry has accomplished, and his ubiquitous style of play has aged gracefully. Nobody else bends defenses as blatantly, and whether or not the ball happens to be in his hands is not the problem. The three-point revolution already happened, and the copycats are still coming—a direct product of Golden State’s championships—but no guard will ever do exactly what Curry does, or replicate the style with which he does it.The Warriors did fall short in the play-in round, and it’s now been two seasons since they made the playoffs. Provided Curry can maintain optimal health, it’s hard to think that streak will last. His effortless range, clever finishes and discerning IQ are as sharp as ever, and there’s a strong argument for him as the most individually skilled player in the whole league. He’ll require additional defensive insulation as he enters his mid-30s. But Curry will always be the guy you want shooting the ball when it counts, and looks poised to extend his run atop the league’s guard hierarchy for as long as his body can handle it. — JWErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 1)Someday LeBron, the most important, imposing and intelligent player of his (and possibly every other) generation, won’t crack this list’s top three. Even after a massively disappointing first-round dismissal (the first of his career) in which despite averaging 23.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 8.0 assists the 36-year-old actually looked mortal, that day isn’t this one.James doesn’t have the same athletic advantage he once did. And even though he’s a step slower, with the physical authority to control every square inch of the floor finally starting to fade, he’s still LeBron. Nobody anticipates live action more succinctly. Nobody analyzes whatever’s happening in their peripheral vision quicker, or makes a fast, ever complicated game look so elementary whether the ball is in their hands or not, on offense or the other end.Bet against him at your own peril. If and when healthy (a more significant caveat every year) James is still a paragon of basketball expertise. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks(Previous rank: 2)Antetokounmpo, a reigning NBA champion and winner of two out of the last three league MVPs, presents the strongest case for No. 1 outside of Durant.\\xa0Giannis isn’t the most fluid scorer. But who else can give you nearly 30 a night—and 50 in a Finals clincher—while setting up teammates a half dozen times per game, while also scorching opponents in transition and playing some of the best, most versatile help defense in the league at 7 feet tall? No one but Giannis does that. And he’s done it while staying relatively healthy for a superstar.\\xa0His ability to quickly bounce back from one of the uglier knee hyperextensions you’ll ever see changed the course of basketball history, and earned the Bucks a title. That shouldn’t be taken for granted. — CHErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 6)After he spent the entire 2019-20 season recovering from a torn Achilles, Durant’s peak ability was called into question for the first time in his career. At 32 years old, would the four-time scoring champion bounce back and look exactly like he did when we saw him last—which is to ask, could he again be one of the world’s two or three best players?Durant’s regular season was disrupted by a strained left hamstring and left thigh contusion, then overshadowed by a blockbuster trade for James Harden. But in the 35 games he did play, KD looked like the same guy, with a statistical profile that either matched or exceeded most of his career averages.Then the playoffs happened. In them, Durant submitted the most impressive series of his career, averaging a hyper-efficient 35.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists against the Bucks, eventual world champs that had zero answer for his excellence. It was pantheon worthy, and made debate over if we’ve ever seen a more ruthless iteration completely justifiable. When the dust settled, his place at the top became a universal truth. Anyone who wants to lobby for another candidate can just ask Giannis Antetokounmpo. Standing on the court after he just eliminated Durant’s Nets in their own gym, the two-time MVP called his opponent “the best player in the world.” Who are we to argue? —MPMore NBA Coverage:Sports Illustrated may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.Randle has more than $155,000 worth of fines from the NBA this campaign.Thursday's Sweet 16 Best Bets and Odds: Bank on Villanova and GonzagaVarious former World No. 1 players praised the Australian for her accomplishments in her career.The retired fighter received the charges based off an incident that occurred on Dec. 18.Who is the real transfer portal king in college football?

       " \"NBA Top 100 Players 2021-2022 | Ranking The Best Basketball Players & Prop BetsPosted: Oct 31, 2021Last updated: Feb 8, 2022The NBA’s 75th season is just around the corner, as the 2021-22 campaign is set to begin Tuesday, October 19. Starting off the action is a matchup between last year’s Eastern Conference heavyweights — the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks — followed by a meeting between the Golden State Warriors and new-look Los Angeles Lakers.In preparation for the upcoming year, we at The Game Day took the liberty of ranking the top 100 players in the NBA. This was no easy list to compile given the vast amount of talent across the league, and do note that it is entirely subjective.Additionally, if you’re looking to place a few preseason player and team prop bets before the games are underway, you’ve come to the right place. Below, you’ll find some of our favorite picks mixed into the NBA Top 100 list, including a few major NBA award winners.With that said, let’s dive right in.Looking to bet on the NBA this season?

Although the high-scoring point guard isn’t the player he once was with the Charlotte Hornets, New York clearly upgraded at the position by bringing him in.A native of the Bronx, Walker will be welcomed with open arms by Knicks fans hoping to see their team make consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 2013.If Walker proves to be a solid fit in Tom Thibodeau‘s system alongside Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, New York should have no issue returning to the postseason despite playing in a surprisingly crowded Eastern Conference.prop bet Bet $20, Payout $33Kemba Walker could experience a renaissance year with his hometown New York Knicks in 2021-22. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Toronto Raptors forward OG Anunoby is one of the most popular picks to win Most Improved Player in 2021-22, and it’s not hard to see why. The 24-year-old has made large strides in each of his first four NBA seasons, but he feels especially primed to have a breakout year.With Kyle Lowry out of the picture, someone on this Raptors team needs to step up and become the go-to guy. Pascal Siakam floundered when given the opportunity last year, and Fred VanVleet isn’t a No. 1 option.That leaves the up-and-coming Anunoby, a rock-solid two-way wing with an improved shooting touch and hunger for the spotlight. If he can lead the Raptors back to the playoffs in 2022 after a disappointing year in Tampa Bay, his name will be rightfully be at the forefront of the conversation.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $420A breakout season could be on the horizon for Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)The Chicago Bulls are going to be a ton of fun this season. Zach LaVine‘s monstrous season wasn’t enough to carry them into the postseason in 2020-21, but with the help the franchise got him this offseason, Chicago may be a virtual shoo-in this year.In addition to acquiring Nikola Vučević at the trade deadline, the Bulls also added DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball via free agency, building one of the more talented starting rotations in the NBA in the process.With that said, it should be known that this is still LaVine’s team. The high-flying guard averaged 27.4 points per game on near-50/40/90 splits in 2020-21, and the additions of DeRozan and Ball should lead to more open looks.Expect LaVine to lead the Bulls to their first postseason appearance since 2017 — and look for them to rack up plenty of wins along the way.over-under Bet $20, Payout $38The Chicago Bulls look like one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference on paper, but will it translate to success on the court? (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Kevin Durant put together one of the best seasons of his career in 2020-21, and that’s saying a lot considering the 33-year-old is a former MVP, 11x All-Star, and 4x Scoring Champion.\\xa0Durant was as efficient as ever in his debut year with the Brooklyn Nets, pouring in 26.9 points per game and shooting a career-high 45% from three-point range.However, where the Slim Reaper really brought his A-game was in the playoffs, where he averaged an absurd 34.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. He was at his best in Brooklyn’s Game 5 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, putting together a 49-point triple-double in one of the single-greatest playoff performances in NBA history.To put it simply, there’s no stopping KD. As long as he can stay healthy this year and keep his production up, there won’t be anybody standing in the way of him earning his second Most Valuable Player award.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $160\\nJuan Carlos Blanco20 hours agoRead more\\nSkyler Carlin2 days agoRead moreBet NowBet NowWed 03/23, 5:00 PM ET Bet NowBet NowWed 03/23, 7:00 PM ET Bet NowBet NowWed 03/23, 9:00 PM ET Bet NowBet NowWed 03/23, 10:00 PM ET +8.5+112-9.5+112Thu 03/24, 7:09 PM ET +4.5+100-5+100Thu 03/24, 7:29 PM ET -1.5-105+1-105Thu 03/24, 9:39 PM ET +1.5-102-1.5-102Thu 03/24, 9:59 PM ET +12.5-112-12.5-112Fri 03/25, 7:09 PM ET +7.5-110-7.5-110Fri 03/25, 7:29 PM ET Terms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyTerms & conditions applyThe Iowa State Cyclones were picked to finish last in the Big 12 preseason media poll, but are defying those preseason expectations and search for a trip to the Elite Eight when facing the Miami Hurricanes. Betting Impact:The Hurricanes are -2.5 point favorites in their Sweet 16 matchup with an O/U of 133.5, per BettingPros consensus odds. Miami did not have the loftiest preseason expectations either, as they were picked to finish 12th out of 15 ACC teams. Iowa State is 5-1 ATS in its last six games as underdogs, and Miami is 6-1-1 ATS in its last eight games overall. Something has to give with the total as well, as the under is 4-0 in Iowa State's last four neutral site games as underdogs, and is 5-0 in Miami's last five neutral site games as favorites. The Purdue Boilermakers have opened as -12.5 point favorites for their Sweet 16 matchup against the Saint Peter's Peacocks with an O/U of 136 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Betting Impact:Purdue is by far the biggest of all eight favorites in the Sweet 16, which has three No. 1 seeds also in action. The Peacocks are attempting to be the first-ever Sweet 16 team to advance to the Elite Eight, as the previous two teams that made the Sweet 16 (2013 Florida Gulf Coast, 2021 Oral Roberts) lost in the regional semifinals. Saint Peter's is the first school from New Jersey to reach the Sweet 16 since Seton Hall in 2000. The Peacocks are now 22-9 ATS, which is the best ATS record of any team in the tournament.The Texas Tech Red Raiders opened as -1 point favorites in the Sweet 16 over the Duke Blue Devils, with an O/U of 136.5 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Betting Impact:Texas Tech's Round of 32 win over Notre Dame was the Red Raiders’ 12th NCAA Tournament win since 2018, and they had just eight tournament wins total from 1939 to 2017. The Blue Devils are now appearing in their 28th Sweet 16 (second-most all-time), and the ACC is 8-2 in this tournament. If the sportsbooks get similar betting action the rest of the week to what they have received to this point, it will not shock many to see this line jump the fence. Duke has attracted 72% of the tickets and 64% of the money. The over is 6-1 in Duke’s seven neutral site games, while the under is 9-6 in Texas Tech’s 15 non-conference games.\\n\\n\\nThe Villanova Wildcats have opened as -5 point favorites over the Michigan Wolverines in the Sweet 16, with an over/under of 135.5 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Betting Impact:Villanova is the third-biggest favorite of all eight Sweet 16 games, as only top-seeded Gonzaga and Purdue (facing No. 15 seed Saint Peter's) are bigger favorites. Since 2001, No. 2 seeds have faced No. 11 seeds ten times in the Sweet 16. In that span, the No. 2 seeds are 8-2 SU and are 5-4-1 ATS. With Michigan's Round of 32 victory over Tennessee, it marked the first time it had won consecutive games since winning back-to-back games on February 8th and 10th. Villanova is 12-1 in its last 13 games, and seven of those victories have been by six or fewer points.The Houston Cougars have been underdogs just once all season, but find themselves underdogs in their Sweet 16 matchup against the top-seeded Arizona Wildcats. Betting Impact:The Wildcats are -1.5 point favorites over the Cougars, per BettingPros consensus odds. The Wildcats have been three-point favorites or fewer on three occasions, and they are 2-1 SU and ATS in those games. Houston has been underdogs just once all season, covering as +3 point underdogs but losing outright to Alabama 83-82 on December 11th.

       " 'Top 100 NBA Players of 2021Who will be the NBA’s best players in the 2020–21 season? Sports Illustrated‘s Top 100 list returns, aiming to answer that question.As always, this is a wide-ranging exercise with a host of qualified candidates. There’s an abundance of information and analytical resources available with which to assess players. The rankings were again determined holistically by a combination of data and subjective evaluation, aiming to take players out of their team contexts and look at their skills and performance in a vacuum. These rankings are specifically for the upcoming season, and they do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2020–21.It’s best to look at these rankings as short-term projections, based on performance history and the impact of a player\\'s age—some growth can be expected from younger players, and a degree of potential decline from older veterans. This is not a representation of a player’s trade or market value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact—on offense, on defense, structural and otherwise—and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill sets.Availability due to injury and future injury risk has always factored into this process—this year, the two resulting omissions were Klay Thompson and Jonathan Isaac. Stars like Kevin Durant and John Wall are making their returns from serious setbacks. Others, like Kemba Walker and Kristaps Porzingis, are already banged up to start the season. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year’s list, click here. We also compiled a watch list of 12 young players who could make the top 100 for years to come.\\xa0This is the first Top 100 list without Rob Mahoney, who\\xa0along with Ben Golliver\\xa0set the standard for this process over the better part of the past decade.

Cooper/USA TODAY Sports; Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports; Kelvin Kuo/USA TODAY Sports100. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursThe Spurs are in the midst of pivoting to a new era, with DeMar DeRozan’s and LaMarcus Aldridge’s contracts set to expire after 2020–21. So who will lead San Antonio forward? Murray is likely the franchise headliner. He isn’t a prototypical point guard, but Murray’s athletic gifts are undeniable. He’s a superb on-ball defender, sporting a 6\\' 10\" wingspan that makes life increasingly difficult for opposing guards. Murray’s ability to upsize onto larger guards provides significant value, as does his ability to wreak havoc in passing lanes. There’s a significant dose of uncertainty for San Antonio after two decades of sustained success. Murray’s defensive excellence should help stabilize the ship. His defensive value and transition prowess lands him the final spot on our Top 100, and he’ll need to improve his half-court offense to move much higher. Murray attempted fewer than two threes per game last season, and his reticence from beyond the arc isn’t an isolated statistic. He doesn’t quite explode to the rim in the half court, nor does he look to create his own shot. He’s often too content to probe and dish, limiting his scoring impact in a middling offense. Let’s hope Murray truly takes the reins of San Antonio’s offense after an underwhelming offensive campaign in 2019–20. —Michael ShapiroGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated99. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatHow important is Robinson to the Heat’s offense? When he, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo shared the floor last season, Miami had an offensive rating of 115.8, practically equivalent to the all-time mark of 115.9 set by the Mavericks in 2020. Without Robinson, lineups including Butler and Adebayo could manage an offensive rating of only 108.8, which would have ranked in the bottom third of the league. Simply put, Robinson’s presence is the difference between a historic offense and a middling one. And it’s all because of the pressure he puts on defenses with his otherworldly shooting. If his breakout year doesn’t prove to be a massive fluke, Robinson will be one of the best floor spacers in NBA history. He shot 46.0% on catch-and-shoot looks in the 2019–20 season. That means his effective field goal percentage on such shots is 69%, which is higher than what LeBron James shoots on attempts within five feet. Only 26 years old, Robinson should have time to grow the other areas of his game. His defense improved throughout the playoffs, though he’ll still be targeted on that end. And his offensive game could use an extra flourish here and there, or at least one counter to teams who can doggedly chase him off the arc (as the Lakers did in the Finals.) As Robinson rounds out his game, he will continue to [ahem] shoot up this list. —Rohan Nadkarni98. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsOne of the most impressive parts of the Nuggets’ most recent Western Conference finals run was that they won two thrilling playoff series without Barton. The 29-year-old small forward started 58 games for the Nuggets last season and was among the team’s most consistent contributors. He averaged 15.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.5% from three and playing a multitude of roles. Simply put, he was Denver’s third-most-reliable player. Barton left the bubble on Aug. 19 with a knee injury, after playing just a single half of an Orlando scrimmage. But heading into this season, those within the Nuggets organization continue to echo his importance. “We’re not where we are without Will,” new GM Calvin Booth recently said. Barton, a former second-round pick of the Trail Blazers, was traded to Denver in the middle of the 2014–15 season as part of a deal that sent shooting guard Aaron Afflalo to Portland. And while Barton was once viewed as merely a solid wing defender off the bench, he has gone on to start 155 games for Denver, almost all of which have come in the last three seasons. It’s possible that Michael Porter Jr. might cut into Barton’s role this season, but the veteran small forward will surely be a key part of another Nuggets team with title aspirations. —Ben Pickman97. Jonas Valančiūnas, Memphis GrizzliesValančiūnas isn’t earning All-NBA honors anytime soon, but Memphis’s big man remains a legitimate problem for defenses on the low block. Valančiūnas posted a 60.6 effective field goal percentage in 2019–20, averaging 0.97 points per possession on post-up attempts. The Lithuanian big man made his mark in the NBA as a skilled offensive big, though he often lacked the physicality expected from a player his size during his seven seasons in Toronto. The move to Memphis has brought out the best in Valančiūnas. He snagged a career-high 11.3 rebounds per game last season, providing a dose of brute strength next to talented youngsters Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke. Valančiūnas remains a key cog for the Grizzlies as they look to snap a three-year playoff drought. —M.S.96. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles Clippers Three-and-D doesn’t do Patrick Beverley justice because it doesn’t account for the fact he’s a Hall of Fame pest. Beverley is one of the most relentless on-ball defenders in the NBA, and he relishes his role as someone who exists to annoy superstars and anger opposing fanbases. (He can also delight people—I distinctly remember Bill Hader got quite a kick at a Clippers game last season watching Beverley harass James Harden.) On the other end of the floor, Beverley is a career 38.1% three-point shooter, which means he’s the kind of player who can stay on the court in the highest-stakes moments. While Beverley’s on-ball tenacity, sneaky-good offensive rebounding, and capable shooting would be welcomed by any contender, his game also exists in a narrow scope. His size (perhaps generously listed at 6’1”) means he won’t be regularly used on perimeter stars. And he’s not a playmaker nor a pick-and-roll option, though he nominally functions as a point guard. These limitations hardly make Beverley a liability. But without the proper infrastructure around him (like playing with superstars), his talents wouldn’t be as pronounced. —R.N.95. Harrison Barnes, Sacramento KingsHarrison Barnes always felt a bit like the fifth Beatle in his time with the Warriors, and perhaps that’s led to an underwhelming evaluation of his skill set entering 2020–21. He’s viewed by many as little more than a replacement-level wing, but a closer look provides a clearer picture. Barnes may not be a standout player in any single metric. But his wide array of skills makes him a valuable player and an underrated asset. Barnes has seen his scoring drop in each of the past two seasons, but a dip in volume has correlated with perhaps the most efficient stretch of his career. Barnes posted his second best career true shooting percentage in 2019–20, and he’s one of 20 players to make more than 275 threes at a clip of over 38% in the last two seasons. Barnes isn’t solely a stationary shooter. He can attack the rim and finish with authority, and he’s evolved into a somewhat savvy playmaker. His contract may dampen his value on the trade market, but Barnes remains an effective player nearly a decade into his career. — M.S.94. Otto Porter Jr., Chicago BullsPorter doesn’t exactly provide the most bang for your buck out of any player in our Top 100. He’s logged just 52 games in the last two seasons, and he’s on the books for $28 million in 2020–21. But despite an underwhelming tenure in Chicago thus far, Porter remains an intriguing piece for this season and beyond. If the Bulls find their way in the playoff chase this spring, Porter could play a crucial role. When healthy, he’s shown flashes as an elite three-and-D guy, sporting an impressive three-point stroke for a player of his size. Porter is one of just five players to shoot over 42% from three in the last four seasons (min. 400 makes), and he sports the size to defend larger forwards and the occasional big man. His fit in Chicago specifically is a bit curious. The Bulls are flush with forwards after drafting Patrick Williams, and there isn’t a deep collection of playmakers on the roster. Porter is a quality stationary wing, but he provides little off the bounce. Perhaps he can make an impact on a contender via a trade before the deadline. —M.S.93. Dāvis Bertāns, Washington WizardsBertāns’s nickname, the Latvian Laser, should move him up at least a few spots on our list, but that’s an argument for another day. What’s not up for debate is Bertāns’s value as one of the league’s most effective frontcourt shooters. The fifth-year forward continues to show impressive range from beyond the arc, making a legitimate leap in 2019–20 as he nearly doubled his scoring to 15.4 points per game. Bertāns has some skill as a roll man and interior defender, but those attributes are quite ancillary to his ability to let it fly from beyond the arc. Only seven players canned more threes last season. Of the 93 players to hit 100 triples, just four posted a better percentage from three. Bertāns can stretch the floor far beyond the arc, and he has one of the quicker releases in the NBA. Washington remains on the fringe of the playoff race entering 2020–21, but they could sport one of the league’s most exciting offenses. Bertāns’s excellence remains integral to the Wizards’ attack. —M.S.92. Derrick Favors, Utah JazzSimply knowing where to be at all times and never flinching is a skill unto itself. And after a year away in New Orleans, Favors returns to Utah as the league’s most overqualified backup center. Despite missing time with an injury, he finished just outside the top-10 in rebound percentage and lent defensive backbone to a team that struggled massively without him. While his mobility has waned to a degree, Favors has proven he can take away easy looks at the rim and is hardly ever out of position. He also shot a career-high 61.7% from the field, remaining among the league’s more effective finishers, capable of overpowering a mismatch when necessary. He’s also an underrated passer in the short-roll, capable of delivering the ball to either corner and greasing an offense in a pinch. Favors knows his strengths and requires minimal maintenance. It’s tough to place a premium on most bigs who present no threat to shoot from distance, and his lack of a jump shot limits his utility as such—the Jazz ought to make his minutes mutually exclusive with Rudy Gobert’s as much as possible. Situationally, there’s only so much value that can be ascribed. But Favors’s presence has long ensured a degree of reliable defensive competence, and his skills continue to age gracefully. And in a reserve role, his services are quite a luxury. —Jeremy Woo91. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersOn June 20, 2019, the Suns traded Warren and the No. 32 pick in the 2019 draft to the Pacers for cash considerations. Just over a year later, Warren, who was in effect traded for cap space, emerged as one of the biggest stars of the bubble. He scored 53 points in Indiana’s opening seeding-game victory over the Sixers and followed that performance up with 34- and 32-point games over Washington and Orlando, respectively. Warren has always been a prolific scorer. He averaged 25 points per game as a sophomore at NC State, his final collegiate season, and reached double digits in his second NBA season. In each of his final two seasons with the Suns, he averaged more than 18 points per game. With Indiana last year, he recorded career-high 19.8 points per game while improving his field goal percentage from 48.6% to 53.6%. While the 6’ 8’’ Warren is by no means a lockdown defender on the wing, he also showed improvement on that end of the floor. The Pacers preached continuity this offseason and have returned the core of their roster, meaning that Warren will yet again be a key scorer for an Eastern Conference playoff hopeful. —B.P.Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports90. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersAt 34 years old, Williams remains one of the most professional scorers in the league. He averaged 18.2 points per game for the Clips in 2020, playing 28.7 minutes a night off the bench. Williams can get hot at a moment’s notice, and many a coach has watched their lead slip away because of a Lou scoring barrage. With the right pick-and-roll partner, Williams can be particularly devastating, penalizing defenses who aren’t fully confident in their coverages. Efficiency is a bit of a bugaboo here, however. Williams ranked in the top five pick-and-roll ballhandlers in terms of frequency last season, but he generated only 0.92 points per possession on those plays. That number is not terrible and certainly above average, but it’s a reminder there are sometimes better looks to be had when Williams commands the offense while some of his more illustrious teammates are on the floor. Also, his size makes him an easy target on defense. All of that being said, if you are in desperate need of a bucket, you could do a lot worse than Williams. —R.N89. Serge Ibaka, Los Angeles ClippersNow entering his 12th NBA season, Ibaka remains one of the most versatile bigs in the league. After being used primarily as a power forward throughout the first decade of his career, including his first season in Toronto, the 31-year-old Ibaka played the majority of his minutes last year as the Raptors’ center. In doing so, he provided Toronto with a capable floor-spacer from the perimeter, shooting 38.5% from three, his best mark since 2016–17. While Ibaka might not be as much of a rim protector as he was when he was a spry 22-year-old blocking more than 3.5 shots per game, he remains a smart and more-than-capable force on the defensive end of the floor. His two-year deal with the Clippers was widely regarded as one of the most economical yet potentially impactful deals of the offseason. According to Basketball Reference, Ibaka had the highest postseason win-share of his career per 48 minutes in last year’s postseason, after averaging a postseason career-high 14.8 points per game. In joining L.A., he will similarly be expected to play a key role for a team with title aspirations, and he will bring Los Angeles much-needed frontcourt flexibility. —B.P88. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn NetsDinwiddie has shown steady growth in each of first four years in Brooklyn, emerging as the Nets’ leading man in 2019–20 after Kyrie Irving’s season ended in February. Squint hard enough and Dinwiddie at times resembles Irving, though with considerably fewer acrobatics around the rim. Regardless, Dinwiddie is effective as the pick-and-roll initiator, excelling when he can drive downhill at opposing bigs. He remains outside any All-Star conversation, but Dinwiddie can be a passable engine for an NBA offense. It could be a bit of an awkward transition for Dinwiddie in 2020–21 with Irving and Kevin Durant now leading the Nets. Dinwiddie posted a career-high in usage last season, and in the games he did play with Irving, there was a palpable tug-of-war within Brooklyn’s system. But if Dinwiddie buys into his role, he could be an effective piece in a high-octane attack. Dinwiddie made 37.3% of catch-and-shoot threes last season, and he could spend a hefty share of minutes alongside Durant when Irving heads to the bench. Dinwiddie could also be in for a sizable new contract next summer if he continues his progression. —M.S.87. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsIt’s undeniable that Millsap’s best NBA days are behind him, but the 35-year-old power forward still remains an important part of Denver’s roster heading into the 2020–21 NBA season. When Millsap joined the Nuggets in 2017 on a three-year, $90 million deal, he helped shepherd a young franchise into the future, culminating, thus far, in Denver’s most recent Western Conference finals run. Despite his scoring output dropping to its lowest mark since 2009–10 and his rebounding total dropping to its lowest mark since 2007–08, Millsap remains a steady defender who is capable of playing a productive, limited role on a high-quality team. The four-time All-Star recorded double-digit points four times in Denver’s thrilling Western Conference semifinals series victory over the Clippers, including tallying 17 points in Denver’s series-altering Game 5 win. He returns to Denver this season on a one-year deal, looking to help the Nuggets reach their first Finals appearance since they joined the NBA in the mid 1970s. —B.P.86. Joe Harris, Brooklyn NetsBrooklyn Nets team president Sean Marks recently said that small forward Joe Harris “epitomized what it means to be a Net.” The 29-year-old Harris fully resurrected his career in Brooklyn after playing just 56 games in his first two years in Cleveland. He enters this season as a starter on a perennial playoff team, having signed a fresh four-year deal worth more than $70 million. Among the 208 players who have taken at least 400 three-pointers since 2017–18, only Seth Curry has a higher three-point field goal percentage than Harris. While his three-point percentage dropped to 42.4% last season—a decrease from his league-leading 47.4% mark in 2018–2019—Harris still finished the year tied for sixth in three-point percentage. On a team that is littered with stars, Harris also appears to be more than content staying out of the public spotlight (as evidenced by being one of the few NBA players not on Twitter). After inking his new deal, the former second-round pick told reporters that he “couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.” He’ll be a key cog in the Nets’ present and future, and as the modern NBA continues to emphasize the importance of consistent three-point shooters, Harris’s value should only increase. —B.P.85. Marc Gasol, Los Angeles LakersAt 35, Gasol is no longer the same player he was back in the early to mid-2010s, when he anchored a Grizzlies team that was a perennial postseason threat. He still remains a valuable piece on any team he joins. While Gasol averaged 19.5 points per game in the 2016–17 season, that number dropped to a career-low 7.5 points per game last year, in his first full season with the Raptors. The Spanish center’s post-up game has diminished, but he has been more open to taking three-pointers in recent years, shooting 38.5% for Toronto in 2019–20. The former Defensive Player of the Year remains a force on that end of the court, using his high IQ and strong instincts to make an impact. As an example, he was part of all four of Toronto’s best defensive lineups that logged at least 50 minutes. “I use a lot of communication as a center,” Gasol said recently. “You’re behind them. I think communication builds trust and it solves problems.” Originally a Lakers second-round pick, he’ll finally join the franchise that drafted him after signing a two-year veteran minimum contract. L.A. had the league’s third-best defensive rating last year, behind just Milwaukee and Gasol’s old team, Toronto, and he should further solidify an already strong defensive group. —B.P.84. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPerhaps because he plays in Sacramento, it’s gone somewhat unnoticed how downright Curry-esque Hield’s shooting has been since entering the NBA in 2016–17. Hield has the sixth-most threes in basketball over the last four seasons. Of the 16 players with at least 600 made triples in that span, Hield leads the pack in three-point percentage. The Oklahoma product shot a blistering 41.3% on catch-and-shoot triples last season. He ranked in the top 10 in pull-up threes made. Few players in the league are as talented at one specific skill. Hield may be a lethal three-point shooter, but he’s not earning All-NBA honors anytime soon. He’s not a physically imposing defender, and he’ll deliver his fair share of mental lapses on that end of the floor. Hield remains a middling playmaker, with limited skill off the bounce. Sacramento didn’t do him any favors playing at the league’s No. 20 pace last season, limiting the effectiveness of both him and De’Aaron Fox. A stylistic shift could boost both of Sacramento’s backcourt pieces in 2020–21. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated83. Goran Dragić, Miami HeatComing off the bench full-time for the first time since 2011, Dragić was still the Heat’s second-leading scorer in 2020. And when bumped into starting duty during the postseason, he took his game to another level, leading the team in scoring until his injury in Game 1 of the Finals. Dragić is a feisty competitor with a well-rounded offensive skill set. He’s often deadly in pick-and-rolls, adept at finding lanes against all varieties of big men. Dragić will pull up against slower footed centers who sag off him, or he’ll find a way to snake around a smaller five who wants to dance on the perimeter. He’s also a willing lob thrower, and when playing off the ball he can space the floor all around the arc thanks to his reliable shooting. Interestingly, for someone who frequently finds himself in the paint, you’d think Dragić would get to the free-throw line a touch more regularly than he currently does (4.2 attempts per game last season). And while he’s a heady team defender, Dragić can struggle at the point of attack, particularly against quick guards. Those issues are hardly dealbreakers, however, and any contending team would be happy to employ a malleable presence as Dragić. —R.N.82. Ricky Rubio, Minnesota TimberwolvesRubio entered the NBA as one of the most-hyped international players ever. Fans flocked to YouTube to track down clips of the dazzling Spanish star, who first appeared in Spain’s top professional league at 14 and held his own during the 2008 Olympics. The Timberwolves selected Rubio with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. And after three seasons away from the Twin Cities, the now 30-year-old guard has returned to the franchise that initially invested in him. Rubio’s first stint with the Timberwolves was largely marred by injury as an ACL tear cut short his promising rookie season and an ankle injury derailed his 2014–15 season. But the veteran guard has nevertheless been a solid, starting-caliber player, capable of being not only a prolific passer, but also a solid defender and decent three-point shooter. Last season, while with the Suns, Rubio averaged 13 points and 8.8 assists per game while also finishing the year in the top 10 in ESPN’s real plus-minus statistic for point guards. Upon being traded to Minnesota this offseason, he admitted he was a “different player than when I came here, and when I left.” While he won’t be the star they once imagined, he’ll be a solid veteran presence for a Timberwolves team building around D’Angelo Russell and top draft pick Anthony Edwards in the backcourt. —B.P.81. Eric Gordon, Houston RocketsGordon is a difficult evaluation after an injury-plagued 2019–20. Gordon underwent knee surgery in November, then battled a slate of lower-leg injuries throughout the season. When he did play, Gordon looked out of sorts. He posted the worst shooting season of his career, and Russell Westbrook’s control of the offense seemed to have a negative impact. But there’s reason to think Gordon’s dismal year was largely an outlier. With a new coach, new point guard and a clean bill of health, we should see the Gordon of old. At his best, Gordon is a perfect third guard in Houston’s offense. He’s an effective spot-up shooter with serious range, able to stretch the floor from far beyond the arc. Yet it’s not only Gordon’s shooting that makes him a valuable asset. He’s an impressive driver to the rim off the bounce, often punishing defenses who close out too hard on the perimeter. Gordon is more athletic and ferocious at the tin than his reputation suggests. His versatility gave the Warriors fits in the 2018 and 2019 playoffs. Gordon is a bit past his prime, and Houston likely regrets extending his contract. Value questions aside, Gordon remains an impactful weapon in the first year of the Stephen Silas era. —M.S.Jayne Kamin-Oncea/USA TODAY Sports80. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles LakersThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Harrell was the third-leading scorer on the 2020 Clippers. Now a member of the defending champion Lakers, LeBron and Anthony Davis can expect more of the same from Harrell. After initially making his name as a rim-runner with James Harden and the Rockets, Harrell has since added plenty of spice to his offensive repertoire. He’s an effective screener who has the hands to finish as a roll man. He can bully his way into favorable situations out of the post. And every now and then, he’ll also face up from the baseline and take his defender off the dribble. Put all that together, and Harrell averaged a career-best 18.6 points per game last season. The reason he isn’t higher on this list is his poor showing in the postseason, particularly his defensive struggles in the second round. Harrell is undersized as a 6’7” center, which can be an issue against skilled fives or on the glass. With Davis and Marc Gasol, the Lakers likely won’t ask Harrell to be doing as much against bigger front lines. His newest role should be his most streamlined one yet—all he has to do is keep scoring. —R.N.79. Jerami Grant, Detroit PistonsJerami Grant enters the season as one of the most interesting players to watch throughout the league. After playing 26.6 minutes per game largely as a reserve with the Nuggets, the versatile forward signed a three-year, $60 million deal with the Pistons this offseason. According to the Denver Post’s Mike Singer, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant and develop him more as a player, even offering him a similar deal. Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly later said publicly that the team was “under the assumption we would get something done.” But Pistons first-year general manager Troy Weaver said Grant was their top priority, and Grant said at his introductory Pistons press conference that the challenge of Detroit “intrigued” him. The 26-year-old will look to become a more complete player with the Pistons. He has proved to be a versatile defender and has shot nearly 40% from three in each of his past two seasons. However, it remains to be seen whether the former second-round pick can grow into a go-to scorer or merely a solid role player for years to come. —B.P.78. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzDespite losing in the first-round of last year’s postseason, the Jazz are again banking on roster continuity to pay dividends. Among the players expected to contribute in important roles is Ingles. The 33-year-old forward started just 45 games in 2019–20, his lowest total since his third year with the franchise, and he at times struggled to adjust back to a reserve role after becoming an every-night starter in 2017–18 and 2018–19. But he enters this season still playing the role of an essential secondary creator who won’t overstep his ability. Ingles shot 39.9% from three last season and was a steadying defensive presence for a Utah team that went 44–28. In the postseason, the 6’7’’ Australian saw his minutes increase even though he struggled, by his standards, in Utah’s lone playoff series, shooting just 35% from deep. There is little uncertainty to Ingles’s game, and he remains a crafty perimeter player any winning team would want to have. —B.P.77. Gary Harris, Denver NuggetsWill the real Gary Harris please stand up? A frustrating run of injuries has limited his availability the past two seasons, and his efficiency has dipped. But Harris is still just 26, and the established value of his skill set bodes well. His penchant for cutting and spotting up and his embrace of difficult matchups on the other end of the ball allow him to fit in with just about anyone. With the Nuggets’ most potent lineups likely to include Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter together, Harris’s feel for complementing others, limiting mistakes and making plays in a pinch has never been more critical. It’s one thing to find a player who’s willing to fit in, but another entirely when the crux of his game is so well suited for just that. The thought he might become Denver’s third star has subsided, but if clean health and renewed confidence are in the cards, Harris’s shooting percentages ought to trend back upward, adding the requisite punch that would return him to form. A thorough understanding of Harris’s value has always been best obtained by watching closely, not poring over his numbers. —J.W.76. Bogdan Bogdanović, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks shelled out $72 million for Bogdanović in the offseason, and his offensive skill set should make the contract a worthwhile play for Atlanta. Bogdanović projects to be an idyllic backcourt mate for Trae Young, sporting a 40.7% mark on catch-and-shoot triples in 2019–20. Bogdanović is a quality spacer, but perhaps more importantly, he sports the playmaking ability to take some share of the offense from Young. Atlanta’s franchise cornerstone is an immensely gifted offensive player, but the Hawks’ offense stalled at times as Young dominated possession after possession. Some balance should help both Young and the team’s development in 2020–21. Bogdanović also provides more than what you see on the stat sheet. He has a reputation as a fierce competitor and intense personality, and he provides important size in the backcourt alongside the diminutive Young. Atlanta has its eyes set on the playoffs in 2021. Adding Bogdanović was a major step toward making that happen. — M.S.75. Zach LaVine, Chicago BullsVolume scorers are perhaps the trickiest players to place in an exercise like this, and there may be no better example than LaVine, who placed 11th in the league with a career-high 25.5 points per game. As he’s matured, he’s curtailed some of his mid-range proclivities in favor of more threes and rim attempts, which has been a step in the right direction. Doing what he’s done is not an easy task, and capable shot-creators with his size and explosiveness are few and far between. Whether his preferred style of play—which has never involved much defense—can run conducive to team success is still the question hanging over his real value. He’s not an elite jump shooter or play finisher, nor is he a free-throw-drawing monster, and creating for others has never been a major piece of his identity, either. If he’s stretched himself to his limits putting the ball in the basket, LaVine will need to evolve in a different direction to make the most of his considerable ability. He remains one of the most impressive athletes in the NBA, and his ability to create for himself could still be meaningful to a winning team. His prime years may be defined by his capacity to adjust. —J.W.74. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix SunsThere were reasons for caution regarding Ayton’s outlook early in his career. His efficient rookie season was marred by a lack of physicality and defensive intensity, and he started out 2019–20 with a 25-game PED suspension. But Ayton’s 38-game sample last season should provide significant optimism for the young center’s future. Ayton is one of the game’s most skilled young centers, and with him flanked by two All-Star guards, a monster 2020–21 could be in store. Ayton’s offensive skills jump off the screen in a variety of ways. He sports a soft touch near the rim and around the foul line, and he’s a prodigious force in the pick-and-roll. Ayton averaged 1.16 points per roll possession last season. He shot nearly 55% from the field. There’s still growth to be had on the defensive end, but those problems should be solved with added experience. With Chris Paul now in the fold, Ayton could very well rocket up our Top 100 entering 2021–22. — M.S.73. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsWith Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green no longer in Toronto, Anunoby was thrust into a starting role last season, and he excelled. Anunoby is kind of the platonic ideal of a three-and-D guy. He shot 39.0% from behind the arc in 2020 and played stellar defense on the other end of the floor. At 6’ 7”, Anunoby is perfect for the modern NBA because of his ability to guard multiple positions and allow for lineup flexibility. The Raptors maintained their championship-level defense last year despite the high-profile departures, and that was in large part because Anunoby was ready for the responsibility of matching up with talented wings. While he may not be a pure shutdown defender just yet, OG has all the tools to enter the upper echelon of stoppers, and he’s already giving people trouble. His athleticism gives his offense a little bit of bounce as well. He doesn’t have to be a pure catch-and-shoot guy, though getting his three-point attempts up would be a welcome sight. With Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka now gone as well, the Raptors are well removed from their 2019 championship squad. Expect an even bigger role for Anunoby moving forward. — R.N.72. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksIt’s quite possible Lopez exemplifies the shift in the role of the modern big man better than any other player in the league. Throughout his first six NBA seasons with the Nets, he took just seven total three-pointers. But in 2016–17, he fired 387 threes, up from 14 total the year prior. Lopez saw his three-point percentage drop from 36.5% to 31.4% last season, his second in Milwaukee. However, he remained an ideal stretch five who frequently stepped out on the perimeter, but was still able to punish smaller defenders around the rim. The 32-year-old center also has evolved into a centerpiece of Milwaukee’s league-best defense, finishing fifth overall in ESPN’s real plus-minus for centers last year and third in defensive real plus-minus. While Lopez played just 26.7 minutes per game in the regular season, his minutes increased to 32.8 per game in the playoffs. Expect a similar trend this season with the team looking to make its first finals appearance since the 1973–74 season. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated71. JJ Redick, New Orleans PelicansDon’t be fooled by the quantity of podcasts, entering his 15th season, Redick remains one of the most accomplished marksmen in the Association. In his first season with the Pelicans, the veteran had the second-best three-point shooting mark of his career, connecting on 45.3% of his attempts from beyond the arc. If anything, Redick was slightly underutilized on a young New Orleans team, playing his fewest minutes per game (26.4) since 2011. Redick offers space as soon as he steps on the floor, and his conditioning at age 36 should be commended. His constant movement generates open looks despite the undivided attention of his defender. While Redick’s own defense isn’t sterling—the Pels were 3.7 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Redick off the floor—he’s still more than capable of staying on the court in high leverage moments, the key test for any specialist. Of course, while he has acquired a particular set of skills over a long career that can make him a nightmare for opponents, Redick’s narrow scope means he’s at his most valuable on a team already studded with stars. Whether or not Redick is in the perfect role for himself on an up-and-comer, he should continue to provide some much-needed room for Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram through 2021. —R.N\\xa070. P.J. Tucker, Houston RocketsJames Harden has transformed the Rockets franchise over the last decade, but P.J. Tucker remains Houston’s heartbeat. Since the start of the 2012-13 season, he has played the most games (637) of any player in the league and even entering his age-36 season, Tucker is an elite defensive force. Only the game’s truest behemoths can gain an inch on Tucker in the post. Few guards can skate by him on an island. Houston’s switch-everything scheme in prior years would have been rendered completely ineffective without Tucker’s presence. He has his limits offensively, but finds a way to provide value on that end of the floor. He’s become one of the league’s most effective corner-three specialists, and he’s developed a canny floater in recent years. Tucker’s smarts and versatility have made him an invaluable cog in Houston over the last three seasons, and until further notice. —M.S.69. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksCapela is the forgotten man in Atlanta’s rotation after the Hawks’ offseason makeover. Much of the focus has been on the acquisitions of Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari, but the Hawks should have a marked upgrade at center as well in 2020–21. Capela isn’t in the top tier of centers—largely due to his limited offensive skill set—though when healthy, he can truly be a dominant interior force. Capela may in essence function as Atlanta’s most important addition. The former Rockets center is a gifted athlete. He’s a quality lob threat, and more importantly, he can hold his own on an island with wings and guards. Capela is at his best in transition. He feasted on free dunks off James Harden outlets in Houston, beating the likes of Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokić down the floor time and again. If Atlanta relies on a quick tempo in 2020–21, Capela could truly thrive. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated68. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsIt’s possible Smart’s career-best 2018–19 season—when he appeared to take a step forward as a scorer—was something of a mirage in terms of shooting. But if he’s proved one thing over the years, it’s that there’s a method behind his unique brand of chaotic good. Smart is an energy-giver in a way that few, if any, of his peers can truly match, flying around defensively to create stops, occasionally catching fire from distance, and ratcheting up the intensity level of a given moment. He’ll never be the king of efficiency, but he’s fashioned himself into a more reliable jump shooter over the years. Smart doesn’t always take care, but he always cares, sometimes more than he should, always for the right reasons. There will be nights he struggles to find the net, and others where one or two particularly inspired Smart shifts can swing the outcome of a game. He’s become an indispensable piece of one of the NBA’s better teams, and he’s earned first-team all-defense honors in consecutive years. And in an exercise like this that attempts to remove players from their contexts, his situational worth to the Celtics might even be slightly undersold. —J.W.67. Eric Bledsoe, New Orleans PelicansThe Pelicans come into this season as one of the NBA’s most intriguing teams, with a number of high-upside young players, recently acquired veterans and a new coaching staff eager to lead them to the postseason. Among those vets is Bledsoe, who joins New Orleans after nearly three full seasons with the Bucks. At times, he looked like a potential franchise centerpiece and All-Star-caliber guard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Other times, the Kentucky product looked lost and unable to snap out of various funks. Bledsoe provides the Pelicans with defensive physicality and will certainly help orchestrate New Orleans’ offense, anchored by Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. But much of Bledsoe’s reputation has been defined by his playoff struggles, having shot just 25% from three-point range in last year’s postseason and just 23.6% from deep in the 2018–19 playoffs. He certainly won’t have the same spotlight on him in New Orleans that he did in Milwaukee, and as a result, maybe he flourishes for a team with more modest aspirations. He remains a difficult player to stop in transition and a solid rebounder, especially for a guard who is just 6’1’’. It’s unlikely he’ll ever make an All-Star team, but don’t be surprised if he looks more like the guard that averaged more than 20 points per game in Phoenix. —B.P.66. Robert Covington, Portland Trail BlazersCovington is largely an ideal three-and-D forward, especially on the defensive end. The Tennessee State product can legitimately defend both guards and larger wings, excelling as a weak-side helper. Only two players tallied more steals in 2019–20. Just nine finished with more blocks. Covington should continue to be a valuable defensive asset in Portland, where he’ll excel as a versatile frontcourt piece alongside Jusuf Nurkić and Derrick Jones Jr. Covington should help the Blazers secure a playoff spot in an increasingly crowded West. There are some offensive shortcomings to note with Covington. He’s more of a stationary shooter than anything on the offensive end, and his jumper ebbs and flows more than one would like. Covington struggled mightily from three in the NBA bubble, and while that may be a small sample, he’s never been a truly knockdown shooter. Perhaps playing alongside Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum will generate more wide-open looks in 2020–21. —M.S.65. Al Horford, Oklahoma City ThunderHorford has taken a relative tumble in his reputation across the league after an ill-fated stint in Philadelphia, but the five-time All-Star should be a stabilizing force for a young Oklahoma City team in 2020–21. Horford was relegated to spacer status alongside Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, zapping him of his best skills as an offensive player. Horford is a terrific interior passer and effective pick-and-roll partner. It’s easy to see him forming a quick rapport with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is additionally crafty in the two-man game. Horford’s intelligence could have an effect similar to Chris Paul’s in Oklahoma City, though it’s unlikely to be truly reflected in the standings. For a team now deep into its rebuild, Horford provides professionalism and competence. He should be better in 2020–21 than he was in his final year in Philadelphia. —M.S.64. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesMemphis’s future is bright after a string of lottery appearances, and not solely because of Ja Morant. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke are two of the Western Conference’s more exciting young forwards, looking like a potential top three in the years to come. A little lottery luck has gone a long way, leading to plenty of optimism surrounding Taylor Jenkins’ squad. Jackson shined in his second NBA season, making a significant leap as a three-point shooter. The Michigan State product shot 39.4% from beyond the arc on 6.5 attempts per game, more than LeBron James, Jaylen Brown and Joe Harris. And Jackson’s skill isn’t solely tied to his value from three. He averaged 1.24 points per roll possession, sporting comparable numbers to Rudy Gobert and Bam Adebayo. He’s foul-prone, but a versatile defender, who should be even better on that end as he gets stronger. Morant has a pair of true weapons in the frontcourt, headlined by the former Spartan. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated63. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City ThunderThe Thunder’s premeditated decision to tear down a longtime playoff team came with Gilgeous-Alexander’s best long-term interests in mind. He makes his Top 100 debut on the cusp of stardom, and with another step forward in his development, this ranking may end up looking unnecessarily patient. There are few guards anywhere who check as many crucial, creative boxes: He handles with an unpredictable cadence, he’s dangerous in ball screens, boasts catch-and-shoot chops, and can lean on a reliable in-between game when he can’t get to the rim. At 22 years old—and standing 6’ 5”—Gilgeous-Alexander has displayed prodigious comfort in all those areas. He’s good at pretty much everything already, and in his third season will inherit a heavy on-ball workload for the first time, with shooters around him. The big unknowns are to what degree he can amplify his playmaking skills (in two seasons as more of a secondary handler, his assist-to-turnover ratio is a respectable 1.8), and just how dangerous he’ll become shooting from distance. Defenses will consistently key on him for the first time, and he’ll be tested. But based on all we’ve seen, it feels like a simple matter of time before his next meaningful leap. —J.W.62. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsFor a player who has yet to make an All-Star team, Nets guard LeVert has been one of the most talked about players in the league. He’s shown improvement in each of his four seasons, tallying career highs in points (18.7), rebounds (4.2), assists (4.4), three-point shooting (36.4%) and minutes (29.6) per game last season. But the question remains whether he’s merely a high-quality secondary option or whether he could lead a team on a daily basis, and in turn, whether he could be the centerpiece of a trade for another star. This summer, LeVert shed some light on that question, leading the shorthanded Nets to a 5–3 record as he moved from a secondary scorer to a primary ballhandler and scoring role in the bubble. And while the Raptors discharged the Nets in four games, the 6\\' 6\" guard averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 assists per contest on 18 shots per game. LeVert admitted during media week that he’s heard the noise around his name in rumors, but said that team general manager Sean Marks has been an “open book” in terms of keeping the 26-year-old informed. “Whatever happens, it was meant to be,” LeVert said recently. Maybe he’ll become the Nets’ true third star alongside Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, or maybe he’ll get moved. Either way, LeVert has shown steady improvement throughout his career, and has a strong foundation to build off. —B.P.61. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicIs Gordon still an up-and-coming player, or has he hit his ceiling? It’s a question that remains tough to definitively answer, and one that can similarly be asked about the Magic. Still just 25 years old, Gordon averaged 14.4 points on just over 12 shots per game last season, down from the past two. He remains a versatile forward capable of guarding four positions if needed, but it also appears clear with every season that he’ll never be more than an average three-point shooter, thus limiting his offensive ceiling. Gordon still flashes glimpses that remind people of Blake Griffin, Draymond Green and Pascal Siakam, but there are other times he looks like he’d be better suited as a secondary or tertiary option. Gordon is no doubt a capable player, but with unrestricted free agency two full seasons away, more clarity about his future—or how teams value him—will come sooner than later. —B.P.60. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersBoston appeared to pass on taking Turner in a potential Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade, perhaps a questionable decision given Turner’s impressive talent. Though he isn’t exactly a brick wall on the low block, he’s established himself as an elite weak-side shot blocker, with 2.1 blocks per game in 2019–20. Turner adds impressive stretch capability from beyond the arc as well, canning 37% of threes on 446 attempts over the last two seasons. Turner is a malleable offensive piece for the modern game. He’s likely worth the $52.5 million owed over the next three years. Turner provides quality versatility, but his offensive skill set does leave something to be desired at times. He doesn’t pair his range with any real physicality, and he’s not exactly quick enough to beat bigs off the dribble when they chase him onto the arc. Turner is a bit of a stationary shooter, albeit a quality one. His age and shot profile suggests he can be an impactful force for years to come. But without further offensive development, there is likely a ceiling on Turner’s potential. —M.S.59. John Collins, Atlanta HawksAtlanta gave its roster a major makeover ahead of 2020-21, shelling out nine figures for Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari in a push to reach the postseason. The pair of free-agent signings will be joined by frontcourt newcomers Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, creating a short-term logjam. But the added pieces won’t cut into Collins’s production as much as one may think. The Wake Forest has been a prodigious offensive force and will be a part of unlocking Atlanta’s tantalizing ceiling. Collins is an ideal frontcourt player alongside Trae Young, at least on the offensive end. His evolving jumper—40.1 percent from three in 2019–20—creates legitimate spacing in pick-and-pop scenarios, and Collins is downright lethal as a roll man. He averaged 1.31 points per roll possession last season, posting a better mark than Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo and Rudy Gobert. Collins can put the ball on the floor in tight spaces, and he’s an elite leaper at the rim. You can quibble with his defensive shortcomings, as well as his lack of a true position at 6\\' 9\". But Collins’s offensive skills are undeniable. He should command a nine-figure contract next summer, even if he moves on from Atlanta. —M.S.58. Andre Drummond, Cleveland CavaliersThe Cavaliers acquired Drummond last February in a surprising, but relatively low-risk deal that sent Brandon Knight, John Henson and a 2023 second-round pick back to Detroit. The bruising center played eight games with the Cavaliers, who later picked up his $28 million player option. While pricey, Drummond would appear to be more of a short-term option for a rebuilding team. He’ll get the opportunity to try and mesh with All-Star forward Kevin Love in the Cavs’ frontcourt as the franchise looks to develop lottery picks Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro alongside them. Drummond is still a rebound eater, having led the league in each of the past three seasons. He is also a force around the rim, scoring the third-most paint points per game in the league (10.8). Cleveland finished last season with the league’s second-worst defense, and a full season of Drummond should also help improve those numbers, if only marginally. He said recently that his plan this offseason was “always to come back to Cleveland.” The two-time All-Star remains a high-quality player, but for better or worse, he’s still a stat stuffer on a young team. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated57. Fred VanVleet, Toronto RaptorsYet another Raptor who stepped up in the wake of Kawhi\\'s walking away, VanVleet posted career numbers practically across the board in 2019–20. The 26-year-old recorded personal bests in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throw attempts and three-pointers made per game. FVV excelled in a bigger role, also commanding chief ball-handling duties when Kyle Lowry missed time with injuries. VanVleet is dubiously listed at 6\\' 0\", but makes up for his size by frequently barreling his way into the paint and collapsing the defense. He’s also long been a knockdown shooter, and he hit 39% of his threes last year while increasing his volume significantly. And he’s just as proficient on the defensive end. VanVleet’s defense at the point of attack is sterling. Watching him and Lowry hound opposing guards well above the three-point line is thoroughly entertaining. In the conference semifinals, Boston’s offense struggled mightily in the half court, in large part because of VanVleet’s ability to fight over screens and cut off lanes to the paint. Toronto will probably need even more from VanVleet this upcoming season. The departure of Marc Gasol takes away a halfcourt creator. Can VanVleet lead the team in assists? Can he lead the team in scoring? After signing a four-year, $85 million contract in the offseason—and with Lowry on an expiring deal—it’s clear VanVleet is a cornerstone of the Raptors’ future. There’s certainly room for improvement here, like finishing at the rim or bumping up his percentage on pull-up threes. Considering VanVleet’s path to this season—entering the league as an undrafted free agent, proving he could stick, then starring in a Finals against Stephen Curry—the Raptors should be confident he can continue to grow. —R.N.\\xa056. Bojan Bogdanović Utah JazzBogdanović made a name for himself in the NBA as an effective three-point shooter, but the six-year veteran is a significantly more versatile offensive option than he’s been given credit for. Donovan Mitchell remains the headliner in Utah, and Rudy Gobert could very well earn a $200 million deal next offseason. While the Jazz are anchored by those stars, Bogdanović remains an indispensable piece. We’d be remiss not to mention his elite shooting in recent seasons. He is one of six players with at least 500 threes at over 40% over the last three seasons, and his range extends multiple feet beyond the arc. Utah often faces clogged lanes due to the presence of Gobert. Bogdanović’s considerable floor-spacing threat helps alleviate that issue. He also provides valuable scoring off the bounce, which is critical for a Utah offense that at times appears stuck in mud. It’s not blazing speed that fuels him, but rather an innate feel for the other nine players on the floor. Bogdanovic can slither around a Gobert pick en route to the rim. He can pump-fake his way past a defender for a two-dribble pull-up. It’s not the most aesthetically thrilling game, but he can light up the scoreboard in a hurry. Utah is often better than the sum of its parts given the roster’s offensive shortcomings. Bogdanovic’s presence is key to unlocking the Jazz’s attack. —M.S.55.  Domantas Sabonis, Indiana PacersThough he’s not quite a household name, Sabonis comes into this season looking to build on a breakout 2019–20 campaign. The versatile big played 34.8 minutes per game last season, setting career highs for points (18.5), rebounds (12.4) and assists (5.0) per game. His arsenal features a throwback post-up game, and he’s already a prolific screener and passer, throwing the third-most passes per game in the league last year. Indiana is now led by first-year coach Nate Bjorkgren, who has already publicly marveled at Sabonis’s ability. “From Domas being able to just put so much pressure on the rim,” Bjorkgren said, “I just know coaching against him in the past, his ability to screen and dive hard and how physical he is.” He made his first All-Star team last year, and with Victor Oladipo’s and Myles Turner’s long-term futures with the Pacers uncertain, Sabonis appears to be one of the franchise’s centerpieces. The 24-year-old was missed in last year’s postseason, and Indiana was subsequently swept for the third time in four years. If the Pacers want to remain among the conference’s top teams, a lot will be riding on the shoulders of their budding star. —B.P.54. Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana PacersIt’s hard to separate Brogdon from his frontcourt partner, Domantas Sabonis, hence their adjacent placement on this list. The two displayed an almost immediate chemistry in pick-and-roll situations last year, Brogdon’s first with the franchise. The 6\\' 5\" Brogdon is the epitome of a combo guard, fully able to play either an on-ball or off-ball role. He averaged 16.5 points and 7.1 assists in 2019–20 and will again play a central role in orchestrating a Pacers attack that features not only Sabonis, but also T.J. Warren, Myles Turner and Victor Oladipo. How Brogdon will fit alongside Oladipo is among Indiana’s biggest questions heading into this season. Brogdon also saw his three-point shooting slip from 42.6% in 2018–19, his last year with Milwaukee, to just 32.6% with the Pacers. But the crafty Brogdon has outperformed expectations throughout the entirety of his career, and seems poised for a return to form with more help around him. —B.P.53. Gordon Hayward, Charlotte HornetsHayward’s ill-fated Boston tenure has diminished his perceived value across the league, but despite some dampened athleticism, he joins the Hornets as a still-impactful offensive force. Hayward is a quality shooter, to be sure, but that’s arguably the least impressive element of his dynamic skill set. Hayward sports the instincts of a point guard. He’s quick to advance the ball up the floor in transition, and he’s an expert at skipping the ball from the wing to the opposite corner with either hand. Hayward also excels snaking in and out of the pick-and-roll, able to keep defenders on his hip before contorting his body around bigs around the rim. Don’t let his injury history obscure his offensive value. He was relegated to secondary scorer status in Boston, spending most nights as a spot-up specialist, but could see a relative career revival in Charlotte. Hayward can dictate much of the offense alongside LaMalo Ball, and we could even see a sneaky two-man game develop between them. Charlotte would be smart to increase its pace with Hayward and Ball, capitalizing on each player’s vision and skill in the open court. Is $120 million too rich for Hayward? Perhaps. But he should still make a marked impact with the given good health in 2020–21. —M.S.52. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersHarris has emerged as an effective three-point shooter in recent seasons, canning 39.3% of triples over the last three seasons on fairly significant volume. But forcing Harris to largely stand on the perimeter seems to be an underutilization of his skills. He sports a smooth jumper off the bounce, and while he’s not the most explosive leaper, he’s one of the league’s more creative finishers for a player of his size. Harris’s first two years in Philadelphia have been marred by a misuse of his talents, but Brett Brown shouldn’t be completely excoriated. Philadelphia is led by a behemoth center and a point guard without any discernible jump shot, and last year’s roster featured a stunning lack of shooters. Harris was often the lone spot-up option on the floor. Doc Rivers’s tenure should be different. Seth Curry will open up the floor to a significant degree. Simmons should take at least a small step forward with his shot. Let’s hope Harris earns a greater share of playmaking duties in 2020–21, allowing his impressive offensive arsenal to shine. —M.S.51. John Wall, Houston RocketsPlacing Wall in the point guard hierarchy as he returns from multiple serious injuries in his left leg, including a torn Achilles, is a precarious exercise. He returns to the Top 100 as a member of the Rockets, having missed the better part of the last three seasons and trying to regain his footing. Wall is purportedly close to full strength, but a scary question hangs over what remains of his prime years: What happens if the fastest player in the NBA loses any meaningful amount of the interplanetary burst that made him great? Of course, Wall is a terrific passer, but his ability to stretch defenses in transition has always played a role in his gaudy assist totals. He’s always been ball-dominant, and his three-point shooting has rarely been far above average, with his 37% clip over 41 games in 2017–18 looking like an outlier. Wall now joins a Houston team in a role that will stretch the limits of his skill set, as a defined second star alongside the NBA’s usage god himself, James Harden. Even if he looks like his old self, he’ll be asked to mesh in a way he never has before, spotting up, cutting and making himself useful when the ball isn’t in his hands. If the reports about his return to form are accurate, Wall should make this ranking look foolish. But as he hits the other side of 30, his checkered health history, volatile shooting splits, and limited versatility are inseparable from the value conversation. —J.W.50. Mike Conley, Utah JazzConley got off to a rocky start in Utah, adjusting alongside another ball-dominant guard in Donovan Mitchell and appearing in just 47 games due to injuries. By February and March, his play had returned to his usual standard, and he was mostly effective in the bubble, assuaging concerns that his performance level was anywhere close to cratering. Now 33, he remains one of the league’s more calming forces, historically great at limiting turnovers, reading the floor and knowing where the ball should be at any given time. Between some inevitable physical decline, his limited impact on defense and a drop in efficiency, there’s some slight regression taking place. But the tenets of Conley’s game—heady play, dangerous jump shooting, and comfort under pressure—remain sharp as ever. He may not be the piece that gets the Jazz over the hump, but a second full season, health pending, will offer a far better sense of what he has left in the tank. As the third wheel on a well-built team, with a heightened comfort level, Conley is poised to bounce back in a meaningful way. —J.W.49. Danilo Gallinari, Atlanta HawksThe addition of top free agent Gallinari will surely boost a Hawks team that went 20–47 last season. Whether starting or coming off the bench, the 32-year-old remains a high-quality piece, providing his team with a mix of perimeter shooting and fairly versatile defending. While he hasn’t played more than 70 games in a season since 2012–13, Gallinari was a solid contributor for the Thunder last year, averaging 18.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists while averaging less than 30 minutes of action. A 40.5% shooter from three, Gallinari will help the Hawks on the perimeter, as Atlanta was the league’s worst three-point shooting team last season. He will also pair nicely with Trae Young, having shot nearly 42% on catch-and-shoot threes last year. While Gallinari’s three-year, reported $61.5 million contract might be a little steep of a bill to pay—it’s the largest multi-year contract ever for a player older than 30 who has never made an All-Star team—he should make a Hawks roster loaded with young talent more competitive in the short term. —B.P.48. Steven Adams, New Orleans PelicansWhile Adams rarely gets full credit for his services, he remains a king of positional nuance and, of course, a man of prodigious strength. He anchored playoff-caliber Thunder defenses for five straight seasons, regularly finishes among the NBA’s leaders in screen assists and offensive rebounds and occupies an unusually large amount of precious space around the rim. He doesn’t block a ton of shots. His presence dissuades all but the most daring drivers from approaching. Adams doesn’t shoot jumpers, but he frees teammates for open ones with well-angled, incidentally bone-crushing picks. Though he doesn’t rack up gaudy rebound totals like some of his peers, Adams’s dedication to boxing out has often led to extra defensive boards for teammates (see: Westbrook, Russell) and transition opportunities for all. Part of what makes him special is that, by all accounts, he’s never cared about those numbers to begin with. Even with a chunk of the NBA veering toward small-ball, Adams remains a difference-maker and an anchor. There’s a reason the Pelicans are banking on the Adams effect—that his ability to physically dominate tight spaces will create better opportunities for others, as they always have. —J.W.47. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersJust because he’s stuck on an inconsequential Cleveland team doesn’t mean Kevin Love couldn’t have value for a franchise with higher aspirations in the present. After an injury-marred 2019 campaign, Love played in 56 games for the Cavaliers during their shortened 2020. His numbers remained largely the same as they have for most of his tenure with the Cavs, averaging 17.6 points and 9.8 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.4% from three. Perhaps the biggest issue for Love is how he plays for a rebuilding team mired in obscurity. His most notable highlight from last season was probably when he intentionally took a three-second call seemingly in protest of his young teammates Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. Love’s numbers indicate that he could probably still be of service to a contender, but it’s fair to wonder if time is running out. The 2008 draftee is now 32 years old. While 2020 was solid health wise, in the previous three seasons Love never played in more than 60 regular season games. And though the defensive spotlight on him was artificially heightened because of the Cavs Finals runs of yesteryear, Love is still far from an anchor on that side of the ball. Those reasons are likely why he didn’t pop up during an offseason filled with trades, despite having a contract that runs only through 2023—and actually decreases in value his final season. Unless a motivated Love again plays for a team with some level of competitiveness, it can be difficult to discern where he fits into the NBA landscape. That’s how a five-time All-Star ends up floating around the middle of this list. — R.NBrad Rempel/USA TODAY Sports46. D’Angelo Russell, Minnesota TimberwolvesRussell enters the year hoping to lead the Timberwolves to just their second postseason appearance since 2003–04, in what will be his first full season with the franchise. Russell was traded to Minnesota last February and averaged 21.7 points and 6.6 assists per game in 12 games with the team. He has developed into a productive player, capable of playing both on- and off-ball, and he should elevate his close friend and franchise cornerstone Karl-Anthony Towns. Russell will also likely spend a lot of time playing alongside veteran guard Ricky Rubio, whom Russell recently said will take pressure off him in much the same way he did for Devin Booker in Phoenix and Donovan Mitchell in Utah. While Russell has struggled defensively, Minnesota management has made it clear that they view Russell as a centerpiece of the franchise. After months of waiting, Russell said he’s excited for what the season could hold. —B.P.45. Blake Griffin, Detroit PistonsWe’ll never see Blake Griffin return to his Lob City form after an array of knee injuries, but the modern version of Griffin can still be downright delightful. The former No. 1 pick is an effective point-forward and a quality three-point shooter. His passing instincts (always underrated) are as sharp as ever. It’s a shame Griffin has largely faded from relevance as he toils away in Detroit. Place Griffin on a contender, and perhaps we’d be celebrating his late-career resurgence. Griffin isn’t exactly a knock-down shooter, but he posts solid percentages considering his significant leap in three-point volume. Griffin attempted 322 threes in 2017–18 and 522 the next season, shooting a respectable 35.5% from beyond the arc. Only seven players hit more off-the-dribble threes in 2018–19, and Griffin retained his prowess in transition at 1.22 points per possession. Griffin sees the floor like few players his size. He’s a terrific big-to-big passer in the lane, and his vision out of the pick-and-roll mirrors that of a quality point guard. Let’s hope we see Griffin in the postseason again one way or another, after his disappointing exits with the Clippers. — M.S.44. Jusuf Nurkić, Portland Trail BlazersIt took more than a year for Nurkić to make his return from a badly broken leg. His triumphant comeback proved one of the summer bubble’s most exciting developments. He showed up having shed weight and picked up where he left off and then some, backing the Blazers all the way to a surprise playoff berth. The best part was how sustainable it all feels. Nurkić’s sublime passing skills and crafty interior game was abetted by a little extra vertical oomph under the basket. His defensive positioning has typically been sound, but he appeared to be moving his feet better than ever. He looked legitimately athletic. With his playmaking and sheer size, Nurkić has fashioned himself into one of the NBA’s best screen-and roll threats, able to command an extra shred of attention while teammates create off him, punish switches, and elevate to the rim when given space. Opponents can ill afford to counter him with smaller bigs, and while he’ll never defend much on an island, he’s harder to play off the floor defensively due to his toughness and commitment. Nurkić was inching closer to his fully realized self even before reshaping his body. He may have unlocked something extra in the process. — J.W.43. Nikola Vučević, Orlando MagicOrlando has a serious logjam in the frontcourt, with shoddy guard play and less-than-ideal spacing often limiting its ceiling. Vučević doesn’t seem to mind. As the NBA continues to emphasize stretch and speed, Vučević remains a highly valuable throwback big. He tallied the sixth-most post-up opportunities in the league last season, and only one more player logged more roll attempts. These aren’t criticisms. Vučević is a quality mid-range shooter, and he can finish effectively with either hand. At times, it still feels as though there’s something missing despite Vučević’s impressive point totals. Vučević’s defensive impact is middling. His rebound percentage and free-throw rates fell last year compared to 2018–19. But he’s become more efficient thanks to an increase in three-point attempts, and with different pieces around him, you still wonder whether he might have more to offer. — M.S.42. Victor Oladipo, Indiana PacersAfter tearing his quadriceps almost two full years ago, Victor Oladipo has yet to consistently display his old explosiveness. As an example, in 2017–18—his last full season—Oladipo attempted 10.8 drives per game, shooting on nearly half of them and converting his attempts at a 52% clip. Last season, despite just a 19-game sample size, he drove to the basket two times fewer per game, and saw his shooting percentage on drives drop to 39.7%. If Indiana is to maintain relevance in the Eastern Conference, he’ll need to re-acclimate himself. New Pacers head coach Nate Bjorkgren told reporters that Oladipo has looked like he has “a lot of bounce to him” this training camp, but it remains unclear whether Oladipo will appear in back-to-back games, something he didn’t do last year in an abridged return. The 28-year-old guard’s future with the franchise also appears to be in doubt, with trade rumors circulating. But a bounce-back would do plenty for his value, and the short-term health of the Pacers. — B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated41. Ja Morant, Memphis GrizzliesHow many point guards, let alone 20-year-old rookies, could have led the collection of parts on Memphis’s roster to the cusp of playoff contention? Consider for a second the fact that the tenets of Morant’s explosive style translated directly from the Ohio Valley conference, in transition and the halfcourt, without a fully reliable jump shot. Morant’s Rookie of the Year case was a simple one. He stepped into the NBA and immediately became one of its best playmakers, capable of delivering accurate passes on the move and near-impossible to keep out of the paint. Functionally ambidextrous as a passer and finisher, whenever he gets there, his devastating dunks and craft around the rim threaten equally. Few rookie guards have ever shown up quite so ballsy and unafraid, and while he’s still learning to curb turnovers and defend with intent, it matters that Morant cares less about showmanship and more about making the right play, rarely shooting just to shoot or passing for the sake of it. His brilliance aside, the young Grizzlies were just the league’s 21st-ranked offense last season. As his game evolves, so will the expectations. Still, you shudder at the thought of what might happen if he continues to meet them. — J.W.40. Kristaps Porzingis, Dallas MavericksThere are few players in league history quite like Porzingis when he’s healthy. For now, he’s still rehabbing a knee injury that will delay his start to the season. The former Knicks cornerstone is a true unicorn at 7’3”, banging home triples at range. Porzingis tallied 403 three-point attempts in just 57 games last year, and he provided significantly more value from three than his 35.2 % mark would suggest. Porzingis’s ability to stretch well beyond 25 feet creates significant driving lanes for Luka Dončić, and allows the Dončić–Dwight Powell pick-and-roll to thrive. Porzingis is no slouch as a roll man himself. He generates a healthy 1.17 points per roll possession, using his mammoth frame to rise above defenders. It’s understandable that Dallas uses Porzingis as a spacer so consistently. But an added dose of screening action in Porzingis’s diet should help both the talented center and Dallas’s superstar guard. — M.S.39. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeRozan is as steady as he is crafty. The 31-year-old guard enters this season as one of just five players to score 1,500 or more points in each of the last five years. Though the Spurs’ 22-year playoff appearance streak ended last season, DeRozan remained a productive force on the floor, averaging 22.1 points, 5.6 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 53.1% from the field. He effectively moonlighted at power forward for a shorthanded team in the bubble, his mid-range skills and craftiness still highly useful. Throughout DeRozan’s first decade in the NBA, he has always been a limited three-point shooter, never making more than three attempts on average per game. In his first season in San Antonio, DeRozan averaged just 0.6 threes per game, converting on just 15.6% of his attempts. While that percentage improved to 25.7% last season, DeRozan will always be a limited commodity from behind the arc, limiting some of his market value, but not his effectiveness. While a move to a contender could be an eventuality, for now, DeRozan returns to San Antonio, providing a stable presence and consistent scoring.— B.P.38. Jaylen Brown, Boston CelticsThere’s no team in the NBA that couldn’t gainfully employ Jaylen Brown, one of the sharpest players in the league both on and off the floor. Brown, in the absence of Kyrie Irving and with Gordon Hayward in and out of the lineup, put together his best season as a pro in 2020. The 24-year-old averaged career highs in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throws, and three-pointers per game. Phew. Brown has always been a heady player, thriving within his means and not trying to take on the mantle of No. 1 scorer. That kind of awareness is incredibly valuable to a roster like Boston’s, with an established All-Star in Kemba Walker and a budding superstar in Jayson Tatum. And that’s not to say Brown, who put up 20.3 points a night, can’t hold his own. For now, Brown is perfectly cast as Boston’s No. 2b scorer to Kemba Walker’s 2a. (Walker averaged 0.1 points more per game than last season.) Brown is the kind of player who can fill in gaps offensively, shooting well from the outside, breaking out in transition, or create a bucket for himself in mismatches. Defensively, Brown isn‘t Marcus Smart, but he’s more than capable of guarding his position onthe ball, and his athleticism means he can match up against both guards and forwards credibly. If there’s anything holding him back, it’s that Brown’s offensive repertoire lacks a little bit of flair. This isn’t an insult, but the limits to Brown’s game stand out when compared to a couple of his top-flight teammates. Though he may not have a devastating stepback or consistently collapse the defense, Brown, from the moment he entered the league, has been a significant catalyst for Boston’s consistent success. — R.N37. De’Aaron Fox, Sacramento KingsDespite being just 22 years old and having never played in a playoff game, Fox appears well suited as the future of the Kings’ franchise. He signed a five-year extension, reportedly worth at least $163 million, this offseason to solidify his future with the club. Fox saw his scoring increase to 21.1 points per game last year and he shot a career-best 48% from the field. Kings coach Luke Walton appeared almost too comfortable with Fox orchestrating Sacramento’s offense, considering Fox totaled more than 80 touches per game, averaging 5.26 seconds per touch, more than Chris Paul, Kemba Walker or LeBron James. The addition of draft pick Tyrese Haliburton should help reduce Fox’s workload in a positive way. While Fox is a blur in transition, he’ll need to work on his three-point shot to ascend into the top echelon of NBA guards, as he shot just 29.2% per game from deep last year on just 3.6 attempts. He has improved in each of his three NBA seasons, and despite playing in a crowded Western Conference, the Kings are banking on the Kentucky product to lead them to their first postseason appearance since 2006. — B.P36. Brandon Ingram, New Orleans PelicansBrandon Ingram came to New Orleans as the jewel of the Anthony Davis trade, but at the time he was anything but a sure bet. Ingram paired an impressive isolation arsenal with frustrating shot selection in Los Angeles, generating far fewer threes and free throws than are necessary for a player with his skill set. His final season with the Lakers represented a step in the right direction. Year 1 in New Orleans was a revelation. Ingram won Most Improved Player and turned in a relatively dominant offensive season. He scored 23.8 points per game on a markedly improved 39.1% from three, posting the same effective field goal percentage as Luka Dončić. Ingram’s free-throw rate continues to trend upward. His three-point rate has skyrocketed. He receives plenty of isolation opportunities in New Orleans, and while Zion Williamson should earn a greater share of volume in 2020–21, the two franchise cornerstones appear to be complementary cogs. Expect continued growth in Ingram’s second year with the Pelicans. —M.S.Steve Dykes/USA TODAY Sports35. CJ McCollum, Portland Trail BlazersWhile Damian Lillard provides most of the fireworks in the Blazers’ offense, McCollum remains an indispensable metronome. McCollum’s steady scoring punch is somewhat jarring from a statistical perspective: he’s averaged between 20 and 23 points per game in each of the last five seasons, shooting between 44% and 48% from the field. The statistical profile makes sense, as McCollum’s game isn’t dependent on his athleticism or lift on a given night. He sports a deep array of tricks off the dribble, leaning on shot fakes, spin moves and crossovers to create the necessary separation between himself and a defender. McCollum doesn’t sport the scoring punch of a true leading man, and his 6\\' 3\" frame still creates defensive issues next to Lillard. But Portland’s second banana remains a quality one, having helped drive the Blazers to the playoffs in each of his seven seasons. —M.S.34. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsDraymond Green played in only 43 games last season, averaging the fewest minutes per game of his career since his second season in the league. With the Warriors beset by injuries to the Splash Brothers, a restrained hand with Green made sense. Golden State was going nowhere in 2020 even with Draymond at his best, so trying to preserve his legs for the future was the right call. And speaking of Draymond at his best, placed alongside the right talent, Green is still one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA. He can defend all over the floor. He’s an able and willing playmaker. He can lead a fast break. And his intelligence reeks of years of Finals experience, which means he’s militant about making the right basketball play at every juncture. The issue for Green is how much longer his body can hold up. The Draymond of the Death Lineup—when he played center and helped unlock probably the best five-man group in NBA history—doesn’t exist in the same way. Green can still reach those heights of tenacious defense and textbook rotations/switches, but doing it night in and night out for every minute he’s on the floor is no longer realistic. The Warriors as a whole seem to be feeling the effects of their five straight Finals trips. Stephen Curry missed functionally all of last season. Klay Thompson will miss a second straight season after tearing his ACL. Green was never as great as those two players at their height, which means even a little slippage in his game affects him much more significantly. Draymond has always been able to compensate for his shooting struggles, for example, by playing some of the best defense in the league. Ideally, the relative lack of stress of last season and the long layoff will give Green enough of an energy boost to look more like the 2016 vintage as the Warriors try to get back on track. — R.N33. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio SpursThere is an ageless quality to the way Aldridge plays basketball. Despite teams’ knowing the core tenets of Aldridge’s game, he is still effective night in and night out. Aldridge has been a stabilizing force in his five years with the Spurs, three of which earned him All-Star appearances. He averaged 18.9 points last year on 49.3% shooting, grabbing 7.4 rebounds per game. And he remains a force in the post, recording the second most post-up touches in the league and shooting 47.3% on his field goal attempts from that area. But despite being largely a known commodity, Aldridge showcased a new skill last year, shooting three three-pointers per game, the most of his career, and finishing the year with a 39.3% mark from behind the arc. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich recently stressed the importance of Aldridge’s improved three-point shooting, saying that Aldridge has worked throughout the summer and into the fall on his perimeter shooting and “is committed to taking another huge step” in that category. It should help him age gracefully. In a contract year at age 35, Aldridge will look to continue meshing with San Antonio’s young guards and serving as a strong pick-and-roll partner with fellow veteran DeMar Derozan. In a Western Conference rich with talent, Aldridge’s ability to help shape San Antonio’s offense will be an important factor in determining if the Spurs can reach the postseason. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated32. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansIt’s still mind-blowing that Zion Williamson has managed to live up to just about every aspect of his considerable hype: In the 19 games he played before the bubble, he was averaging 35.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per 100 possessions while often being deployed in short spurts, and the Pelicans performed like a top-half, playoff-caliber team on both sides of the floor. Williamson did all this without ever being in peak athletic shape—there’s endless debate over his health and playing weight, but he was inarguably more explosive at Duke. That manifested in a similarly effective, but more ground-bound play style, as well some pronounced defensive struggles as he played conceptual catch-up. Still, speculate all you want about the longevity of his body type, but you cannot argue with the results. When he was active, he was New Orleans’s best player. Williamson is a remarkable finisher around the basket, somehow unfettered by any and all comers, with an astute left hand and a multiple-jump explosiveness under the rim previously unseen in a player his size. He’s a smart passer and decision-maker who’s always been able to maximize his impact without having his number called, allowing him to, in theory, pair comfortably with a second scorer within a winning construct. Provided Williamson can work his way toward a physical peak, the surprising diversity of his game should manifest, and the Pelicans will do everything to showcase it. Instead of worrying what he could become, it’s better to save the clichés and just appreciate what’s already happening. —J.W.31. Kemba Walker, Boston CelticsThere are moments when Kemba Walker ascends to a plane of unstoppability that are absolutely thrilling to watch. Walker may not have the explosive or flashy quality to his game like some of his point guard contemporaries, and yet he still has periods of sublime scoring that leave defenders helpless. Those stretches when Walker gets going in the high pick-and-roll, pulling up on bigs who dare go under screens or driving by those who get a little too eager, are very satisfying to watch. Even with Jayson Tatum earning plaudits as Boston’s lead dog, there are moments when Walker looks like the best scorer on the team. Kemba has found a good home in Boston, where he doesn’t have the burden of being the No. 1 but can command the offense when necessary. He’s a high-volume, high-efficiency three-point shooter, and the stepback, midrange J is still as pretty as it was at Connecticut nearly 10 years ago. Of course, there are concerns. Walker experienced knee issues last season that will also cause him to miss the start of this one. His size makes him a frequent target on defense, and calls into question how effective he can really be in an ultra high-stakes playoff game. Knee, size, and defense problems are usually not kind to 30-year-old point guards, especially ones on max contracts. But those moments, people. When he does return to play, Walker is going to have one, two, three, however many of those nights when the ball can’t help to go in, like when he dropped 40 on the No. 1 Bucks last season, or 44 on the Pacers. Walker’s game isn’t as memeable as pull-ups from halfcourt. Don’t let that stop you from enjoying someone who is still a masterful bucket getter. — R.N30. Pascal Siakam, Toronto RaptorsThe honeymoon wasn’t quite as sweet for Siakam, who hit a wall without Kawhi Leonard during Toronto’s seven-game Eastern Conference semifinals loss against the Celtics. Siakam, who made his first All-Star team last February, averaged fewer than 15 points on less than 40% shooting and often looked overmatched as the Raptors’ lead playmaker. Still, over a larger sample size during the regular season, Siakam displayed significant improvement and did appear to be a potential franchise star. His scoring jumped from 16.9 points to 22.9 points per game in the regular season, and he made improvements in his three-point shooting. “I had to shoot [threes] in the NBA and I didn’t have to shoot them in college,” Siakam told Sports Illustrated’s Chris Mannix last fall. “I think that’s a big difference.” Siakam will continue working on his outside shot as he looks to develop a more well-rounded game. He is a versatile defender and pairs nicely with OG Anunoby on the wing. Now in his second season in more of a leadership role with the Raptors, Siakam will look to keep building on his upward trajectory. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated29. Trae Young, Atlanta HawksYoung flashed his prodigious scoring talent as a rookie, but he often looked overmatched amid a concerning amount of turnovers and a shaky shooting percentage. Year 2 was far more encouraging. Atlanta’s point guard finished fourth in scoring at 29.6 points per game in 2019–20, and perhaps more importantly, he turned in a far more efficient season. Young rose from 32% to 36.1% from three even with a leap in attempts, and he improved his effective field goal percentage by a marked margin. Young’s vision is truly elite in the half-court. He’s evolving as a pick-and-roll ballhandler. And even in a shaky situation, Young still managed to turn in an elite offensive season for a player of his age.Young’s 30-foot bombs create an obvious comparison to Steph Curry, but the conflation can be a little misplaced. Curry is one of the best off-ball shooters of all-time, wreaking havoc on defenses as he darts around screens and resets his position after a pass. Young’s approach, at this stage of his career, is more statuesque. He attempted just 105 spot-up threes last season, the same amount as Frank Ntilikina and (interestingly) James Harden. Young doesn’t make any marked impact without the ball in his hands. He turns the ball over at a higher rate than Curry ever did, and while Steph isn’t earning All-Defense honors anytime soon, Young remains a sieve by comparison.Despite his flaws, Young is a legitimately thrilling offensive talent, and he’ll inherit the best roster he’s had yet. Further refinement from Young on both ends of the ball in his third year could launch him into the league’s elite. Right now, despite his gaudy stats, he’s still outside All-NBA consideration. —M.S.28. Kyle Lowry, Toronto RaptorsIn the immediate aftermath of Kawhi Leonard’s departure, there were questions about what direction the Raptors would take. Would Masai Ujiri start tearing down the team and trade away his veterans? Instead, Ujiri put all speculation to rest when he signed franchise icon Kyle Lowry to a one-year extension last October. With the understanding Toronto planned to vigorously defend its title, Lowry had a remarkable 2020. The 34-year-old averaged 19.4 points per game last season, the second-best mark on the club and his most since 2017. Even at his advanced age and with years of playoff runs on his body, Lowry remains one of the most impactful guards in the game.He does everything you want. Pull-up and spot-up threes. An ability to draw fouls. (Fun fact: Lowry’s free-throw rate last season was the fourth-best of his career and highest since 2009.) Aggressive defense. But most of all, while his critics and opponents may find him to be a nuisance, Lowry is one of the most intelligent players in the game. He can seemingly leverage any situation to his benefit. Often that means trying to find a foul at any cost, but there’s also no question Lowry is willing to put his body on the line in a way few people of his age and size are willing to do on such a consistent basis. Toronto was a legitimate contender last year, and Lowry, with his wit, guile, and skill, was the biggest reason why. At 34, it is fair to wonder how much longer Lowry can keep this up. His style of play takes a physical toll. But with the emergence of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, the Raptors are hoping to lighten his burden. If this season does end up signaling a shift in Toronto, any team that takes itself seriously would welcome Lowry with open arms. — R.N27. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee BucksWhile Giannis Antetokounmpo has been at the center of the Bucks’ success in recent years, Khris Middleton has been an integral part of the franchise’s rise unto himself. He’s made the All-Star team in each of the past two years and has shown gradual improvement throughout his career, leading up to career highs in points (20.9), rebounds (6.2) and field goal percentage (49.7) per game last season. The former second-round pick also provides the Bucks with flexibility on the defensive end and is versatile enough to guard at least three positions. While a number of Bucks have put up underwhelming playoff numbers in recent years, Middleton has also been a consistent postseason performer, even upping his scoring average by three points per game in 2019–20. The addition of Jrue Holiday should also provide even more flexibility, as the Bucks’ newly formed star trio looks to lead the franchise to its first title since 1970–71. —B.P26. Jrue Holiday, Milwaukee Bucks Quantifying a player’s true worth defensively can be challenging, but the near-unanimous respect Jrue Holiday has earned from opponents going on the better part of a decade speaks for itself. His unique ability to make opponents uncomfortable, working them quietly off their line to the rim, taking away personal space without fouling, and bending but rarely breaking, has become something of a lost art. Holiday defends guards, wings and even bigs without flinching, his combination of strength and quickness at 6’4” proving unusually functional over the years. He stops the ball, he plays the passing lanes, he’ll switch onto anyone and he understands better than any guard in the league how to leverage his size against taller players. As Holiday’s final season with the Pelicans often demonstrated, no player alone can make a defense great. But the massive haul of future draft picks the Bucks surrendered for him had as much to do with Holiday’s lofty status as it did Milwaukee’s urgency. While Holiday is not a point guard by nature, he can moonlight on the ball effectively and grab and go off the defensive glass. He’s not an elite jump shooter, but he commands respect on the catch. Few players have the energy or wherewithal to provide elite defense as a constant, and accentuating it with a viable, high-usage role on the other end. Holiday still finds time to stuff the stat sheet. It’s hard to put a price on the type of creative optionality a player like that can afford his coach. His shooting percentages ticked down after the Pelicans traded Anthony Davis and should benefit in much the same way when flanking Giannis Antetokounmpo. Holiday remains as well-rounded a secondary star as you’ll find anywhere in the league, and time and again, he proves it. —J.W.25. Russell Westbrook, Washington WizardsSo what should we make of Westbrook after 12 seasons, nine All-Star teams, one MVP and (roughly) a million hot takes? Will we see the Westbrook of the NBA bubble, where he limped through the postseason as his Houston tenure ended in disaster? Or will Westbrook quickly return to form with his third franchise, reminding us all just how physically dominant he can be? There’s reason to bet on the latter. Westbrook was downright dominant for a significant stretch in 2019–20. He averaged 32.9 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in his final 20 contests before the season’s hiatus, carrying Houston’s offense as James Harden struggled through an extended shooting slump. Westbrook remains a lethal force at the rim and in transition. He’s an impactful cutter when he wants to be, and he quietly turned in the most efficient season of his career in 2019–20. Vintage Westbrook was arguably the best athlete in NBA history. The current version is still close to the top of the league.Still, the flaws are more obvious than ever with Westbrook. His jump shot oscillates between middling and broken depending on the week, and his stubbornness regarding said jumper can create plenty of frustration. Acquiring Westbrook means you get the whole package. He’ll bring his maniacal work ethic and competitiveness to each stop. A culture of accountability will be established. But with those benefits comes a certain cost. Houston nearly blew its first-round series against Oklahoma City as Westbrook domineered the action. A strong stretch in 2020–21 could carry the Wizards to the postseason. But in a given series, Westbrook’s shortcomings can sink his team. —M.S.24. Devin Booker, Phoenix SunsThe Phoenix Suns dug themselves a sizable hole before the league stopped play in mid-March and so, despite an 8–0 seeding game run in the NBA bubble, the Suns missed the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season. But Booker nearly willed his way to the postseason, averaging 30.5 points per game on 50.3% shooting in Orlando. A proven bucket getter, Booker averaged 26.6 points per game for the second straight year, leading the Suns in scoring yet again. While Booker is always a threat from the perimeter, his numbers from deep are also statistically underwhelming, at least by his standards, with him shooting just 35.4% from three, though the difficulty of his attempts has something to do with it. Phoenix’s trade for All-Star guard Chris Paul will surely help Booker find more space on offense. Still just 24 years old, Booker will look to continue his ascension into the league’s upper echelon of guards this season, as the franchise eyes a playoff berth. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated23. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz The game continues to slow down ever so slightly for Mitchell, who is refining his naturally helter-skelter approach to scoring and coming off the best season of his young career, managing a 55.8% true shooting clip on 30.8% usage, making his first All-Star team and taking a major step toward All-NBA status. Mitchell announced himself in full over the course of an epic series against the Nuggets, trading blows with Jamal Murray, dropping two 50-point games, and pushing Denver to seven games, over the course of which he converted 53% of his twos, 51% of his threes, 94% of his free throws and averaged 36 points. He’s a challenge to keep out of the paint and gets separation for himself on the perimeter, and he does all that while still playing defense, standing 6\\' 1\" and never seeming to relent.Of course, Mitchell may never match that impossible hot streak again. But he’s ascended the ranks of the league’s most potent scorers for a reason, and there’s plenty more for him to accomplish. If he settles for fewer floaters and uses his explosiveness to put more pressure on the basket, he’ll surely get to the free throw line more than four or five times per game. Mitchell draws plenty of defensive attention and can become a better creator for his teammates during his frequent forays into traffic. Becoming less ball-dominant might lead to more catch-and-shoot looks and another uptick in his percentages. He’s only 24, and it’s all on the table. But Mitchell doesn’t have to do any of those things to be one of the toughest nightly covers in the league. And that’s the scary part. —J.W.22.  Jamal Murray, Denver NuggetsClearly enough, the Nuggets’ magical postseason run—which saw the franchise overcome two 3–1 series deficits—would not have happened without Murray’s stellar play. While many of Murray’s regular-season averages were nearly identical in 2018–19 and 2019–20, the Canadian guard’s scoring jumped eight points per contest in last year’s postseason. He scored 30 or more points in six of Denver’s 19 playoff games, putting up multiple 40- and 50-point showings, and also averaged nearly two more assists per contest. When the 23-year-old Murray agreed to a five-year, $170 million extension in the summer of 2019, some questioned Denver’s decision to anoint Murray as a franchise centerpiece despite his having never made an All-Star team. Now, such doubts appear moot, as Murray enters the 2020–21 campaign poised to build on his stellar playoff run. Alongside two-time All-Star Nikola Jokić and a series of promising role players, it seems as if Murray and the Nuggets will only continue to rise. “We have two superstars in Nikola and Jamal,” head coach Mike Malone said this past September. “And a lot of other really good, young talented players behind them.” —B.P.21. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ersSneer at Simmons’s three-point phobia if you wish, but Philadelphia’s point guard remains one of the game’s most electric guards. Simmons is an absolute force in transition, bullying his way to the rim with a combination of size and speed unmatched throughout the league. The LSU product thrives off of turnovers, and he increasingly leans on his athletic gifts to generate free points for Philadelphia. Simmons won the steals title last season en route to his first All-Defense selection. He paired his ball-hawking skills with improved rotational awareness, anchoring Philadelphia’s defense. For all his half-court shortcomings, Simmons’s transition prowess and defensive dominance makes him one of the Eastern Conference’s most valuable players.Simmons sports the athletic profile to be a top-10 player. But the flaws in his game grow increasingly frustrating by the season. It’s not just that Simmons is a poor shooter. It’s that he’s an unwilling one. Philadelphia’s point guard attempted just seven threes in 2019–20. He attempted 16 midrange jumpers. Perhaps Simmons’s stylistic deficiencies would be acceptable if he were flanked by a cadre of shooters, but given his big-man costar, the lack of any discernible jumper can be downright untenable. Even extending his range past the free-throw line would do wonders for Philadelphia, further unlocking the two-man game between Simmons and Embiid. Perhaps Simmons will show some growth in 2020-21. If not, he’ll remain a tantalizing, yet frustrating talent on the fringe of the All-NBA discussion. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated20. Bam Adebayo, Miami HeatSeemingly once a game, an opposing perimeter player will make the mistake of thinking they have a mismatch against Bam Adebayo. Catching Adebayo in a switch, said perimeter player often calls for an isolation and then tries to blow by Bam to the rim. And sure enough, once a game, that player learns they’ve made a terrible mistake as they quickly realize they have nowhere to go. Adebayo is one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA, and he’s the crown jewel of the Heat’s future. Jimmy Butler often refers to him as the team’s best player, and that refrain may be more than just modesty.Bam’s footwork and intelligence belie his age. At 23, he should already be a consistent candidate for Defensive Player of the Year. He can truly guard any position on the floor, banging with beefy centers or staying in front of speedy guards. His block on Jayson Tatum at the end of Game 1 of the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals was not only picture perfect, it told the story of how special Adebayo is. He wasn’t guarding Tatum on that play—but Adebayo timed his release from his own man to be in perfect help position on Tatum, he had the athleticism to meet him at the rim, and then the awareness to keep the ball in bounds and in Miami’s possession. On the other end of the floor, Adebayo is a fulcrum in the Heat’s motion attack. He’s a deft passer, and Erik Spoelstra often relies on him in lieu of a playmaking point guard to direct the offense. Bam is deadly on handoffs, and his jumper is steadily improving. After mostly being a rim runner his first two seasons in the league, Adebayo morphed into an elbow traffic cop in 2020, ultimately averaging 15.9 ponts, 10.2 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. And he has the potential to be so much more. Just ask the Celtics again, who saw their season ended by Adebayo’s 32 points in Game 6 of the East Finals, including when he went on a run by himself in the fourth quarter, stunning Boston with a flurry of offensive moves to send them packing. Bam is No. 20 on this list, but he’s really just getting started. — R.N19. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn NetsThere always seems to be some form of discontent surrounding Kyrie Irving, who holds the crown as the NBA’s most mercurial superstar. Irving’s tenure in Cleveland ended with a trade demand. He exited Boston after a tumultuous two seasons, and his first year with Brooklyn featured its own share of controversy. But perhaps we’re focusing too much on questions surrounding Irving’s peculiar personality. Brooklyn’s point guard remains one of the game’s top scorers, and, paired with Kevin Durant, it’s possible we’ll see him hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy in 2021. Harp on the backpage headlines if you’d like. Doing so ignores Irving’s immense talent. There are few guards in league history as purely gifted as the 2016 champion.Irving’s sheer statistical resume in recent seasons shouldn’t go unnoticed. He’s one of two players (along with Steph Curry) to average more than 24 points per game while shooting over 40% from three in the last four seasons, and 2019–20 featured Irving’s most impressive offensive campaign. The Duke product averaged 27.4 points per game with a 54.6 effective field goal percentage, scoring 1.06 points per isolation possession. Irving is perhaps the most malleable offensive point guard in today’s game. He’s a dominant force with the ball in his hands, sporting the league’s deepest bag of tricks off the dribble. Irving is also a dangerous off-ball spacer, likely making him a perfect complement to Durant in 2020–21. Irving’s defensive shortcomings are notable. He’s not the warmest personality by most accounts. Yet there’s no denying his historic talent. Don’t be surprised if we see Irving dicing up defenses late into the 2020–21 postseason. —M.S.18. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota TimberwolvesThere isn’t much that the Timberwolves star can’t do, especially on the offensive end of the floor. Towns averaged a career-high 26.5 points last season, while shooting 50.8% from the field. He was an impact player in the post and a top player at any position from beyond the arc, shooting 42.5% from behind the arc on his 5.9 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per contest. But on the defensive side of the floor, the Wolves struggled last season, finishing as a bottom-third unit, with Towns playing in just 35 games. His own defensive concerns remain as pronounced as ever. Towns will look to mesh with D’Angelo Russell, who is beginning his first full season with the franchise, and top pick Anthony Edwards. The Wolves have surrounded Towns with a number of talented pieces, and the hope is that this season will offer a better gauge of where the franchise stands. — B.P.Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports17. Jayson Tatum, Boston CelticsNo one in the NBA made as significant a leap as Jayson Tatum did in 2020, when he went from promising young gun to “Oh my god, this kid is about to be a superstar.” The 22-year-old was sublime for the Celtics last season, leading the team in scoring despite sharing the ball with vets like Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward. Tatum was bonkers, averaging 23.4 points, 3.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds per game. He shot a comical 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts a night, turning his stepback jumper into one of the most lethal shots in the Association.Tatum has the talent to be a scoring leader one day. He can get a bucket from the outside, from the midrange, or by making his way to the rim for a finish or foul. Few guys this early in their career are supposed to have such a layered offensive game, but Tatum plays with the smoothness of a 10-year-vet. His three-point shooting was particularly notable after complaints about him settling for too many long twos in 2019. Tatum bumped up his efficiency last season, and what’s frightening for opponents is how he should only improve from here. Defensively, Tatum isn’t a lockdown guy, but he doesn’t cheat on that end of the floor, and he’s a key part of Boston’s elite unit. Tatum is dripping with polish and yet he’s so far away from his prime. He has many offseasons to tinker with his game. Maybe he wants to add more to his post catalogue. Or maybe he wants to perfect a baseline turnaround. With so many skills already in his arsenal, Tatum is building on a foundation much more advanced than a typical third-year player. And he has the prototypical size—6’ 8”, 210 pounds—to become one of the league’s dominant wings. The Tatum era in Boston is quite young, but he’s already been a key contributor on two trips to the conference finals in only three seasons. It would almost be shocking if Tatum didn’t bring Boston back to the Finals sooner rather than later. — R.N16. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz Employing the NBA’s top defensive center affords a certain degree of stylistic comfort: Over Gobert’s six seasons as a full-time fixture in Utah’s lineup, the Jazz have finished first, second, first, second, fourth and ninth in points allowed per game, often employing a plodding pace and making the playoffs in five of those years. Utah’s performance in the postseason has been a different story—draw the wrong opponent, and the 7\\' 1\" Gobert can look out of his depth rather quickly—but we’re talking about a two-time Defensive Player of the Year who’s made first-team All-Defense in four straight seasons. Indisputably, Gobert remains the best rim defender in basketball, he rebounds at an elite clip on both ends, he’s proved relatively durable for someone his size and he’s a puzzle opponents are forced to solve every night.Like an expert center back or rangy middle linebacker, Gobert forces an offense to simply maneuver its way around him, or avoid him entirely. It’s not so much as the shots he blocks anymore as the angles he takes away, and he’s disciplined, averaging just 3.3 fouls per 36 minutes. As with any 7-footer, some physical decline is eventually in the cards, but at age 28, Gobert remains a tad more mobile than you think, his length proving a great equalizer in changing angles and effecting shots when he’s forced to defend in space. Remember that when the Jazz have gone down in the playoffs, it’s been at the hands of elite offensive talents: James Harden, Stephen Curry and, last year, an ascendant Jamal Murray. They’re guards who can expertly manipulate ball-screen coverages and need just a sliver of space to launch deadeye threes. Lest we forget, most teams don’t have a player like that and have to simply deal with the massive, intelligent man walling off the paint as best they can. As Gobert enters a contract year, Utah will lean on him as long as it’s feasible. —J.W.15. Bradley Beal, Washington WizardsIn Year 8 of a still-underappreciated career, Beal stretched his game to its limits and walked away with another notch in his belt, averaging a career-high 30.6 points without sacrificing much in the way of efficiency. And he did so as the primary focus of nearly every defense he faced. He shot worse from the field on the whole with the added workload, but made it to the foul line more often and averaged a career-high in assists as the top playmaker in a transition year. He’s been perhaps the NBA’s most durable star, racking up minutes without complaint. He took a real leap in the absence of John Wall, and now the Wizards are betting on Beal’s unusual malleability as a viable fit with Russell Westbrook. He remains an elite catch-and-shoot player and could easily inch close to his old neighborhood of 40% from distance if all goes well. There simply aren’t many holes in Beal’s offensive game, with equal capacity on and off the ball, off the catch or using a screen. As the Wizards continue to bat away trade offers and build around Beal, the prospect of his game continuing to improve points to why Washington would hold. Having Westbrook around, you’d hope, will reduce Beal’s creation duties, allow him cleaner looks as a play finisher and improve his results all over the floor. If he takes all he’s learned and demonstrated over the past two years, acquiesces a tad to his new teammate and stays just as effective, Beal could conceivably repeat his 30-point campaign with less exertion, and perhaps more wins for his team. There are players on this list who are more prolific, but few as consistent and reliable. —J.W.14. Chris Paul, Phoenix SunsEverywhere Chris Paul goes, winning follows. In case that wasn’t obvious, the 2020 Thunder are a shining example. After reviving the Clippers and nearly bringing the Rockets to the Finals, CP was unceremoniously shipped to Oklahoma City in the summer of 2019. Instead of trying to force his way out to a contender, Paul, who turned 35 in May, went to work and put together one of the finest individual seasons of his career. CP averaged 17.6 points, 5.0 assists, and 6.7 rebounds per game for the Thunder, while shooting 48.9% from the field. The only other players in the league to average that many points, assists, and rebounds per game while shooting at least 48% from the field last season were LeBron James and Nikola Jokic. That’s how incredible Paul was, all while being a clutch-time assassin for a team that was a Lu Dort three away from upsetting the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Paul looked rejuvenated in OKC. Not only did he relish the role of playing point guard again, he told SI in December 2019 his body felt transformed after changing his diet and workout regimen after the trade from Houston. Paul now only eats plant-based meals, and hired a new trainer after injuries zapped some of his effectiveness as James Harden’s running mate. If those lifestyle changes are long lasting, then the Suns should be a legitimate force this season. So much of the conversation around Paul is about his large contract—and how he will definitely not opt out of the last year of his deal to give himself more flexibility. Well, CP was worth every penny in 2020. Count out the Point God at your own risk. — R.NKelvin Kuo/USA Today Sports13. Paul George, Los Angeles ClippersIt’s become almost impossible to separate the short-term playoff conversation around Paul George from who he really is as a player. Did George struggle during the Clippers inexcusable seven-game loss in the bubble to the Nuggets? Yes. Was the front office smart to sign him to an extension this summer? Absolutely. PG is far from a scrub. Let’s put that to bed right now. He was an MVP candidate in 2019 before hurting his shoulder. And he was carrying that Thunder team that also included Russell Westbrook. George remains an All-NBA caliber defender with an offensive game that’s expertly suited for the modern game. Once healthy, George was exactly what the Clippers needed last season. A deadly second option who could create for himself when called upon while being an absolute sniper from three. PG looked completely recovered from his shoulder troubles with the Clips, shooting a career-high 41.2% from beyond the arc. If anything, L.A. was too cautious with George, playing him only 29.6 minutes a night in the regular season, his fewest since his rookie year (excluding the 2015 season when he played in only six games off the bench after breaking his leg.) While George may fall short of being the true No.1 on a championship contender, it would be asinine to cast him aside as some kind of punchline. He has a recent history of some postseason foibles. He also once impressed LeBron so much that James dapped him in the middle of a playoff game between two heated rivals. At 30 years old, George isn’t an up-and-comer, but he still has time to rewrite the book on the kind of player he is in high-stakes moments. For someone with so much talent, the story is far from over. — R.N12. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail BlazersPerhaps to nobody’s shock, Lillard was the league’s most prolific player in the run-up to last year’s postseason. With a number of eye-catching performances, Lillard led Portland from outside the Western Conference’s playoff picture to the No. 8 seed, a run required after injuries plagued the Blazers throughout the regular season. Overall, Lillard averaged career highs in points (30) and assists (8) per game, while shooting 40.1% from three. He is also currently the league’s best long-range three-point shooter, taking 6.8 attempts from 25 to 29 feet last year and shooting 40% on them. Throughout the offseason, Portland made a number of key acquisitions, bringing in versatile forwards Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr., and center Enes Kanter. The team also re-signed forwards Carmelo Anthony and Rodney Hood. Lillard recently said that his message to team president Neil Olshey was: “Let’s go for it.” The Blazers are just one full season removed from making the Western Conference finals, and it appears as if another berth in the league’s final four is fully possible, especially if Lillard shows even more improvement this season. —B.P.11. Jimmy Butler, Miami HeatThe most interesting man in the NBA, Jimmy Butler found the perfect home for himself in Miami, where the Heat welcomed his aggressive playing style en route to a shocking Finals berth. In the process, Butler outplayed two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the second round of the postseason, and then with his two best teammates (Adebayo and Dragic) injured, he frankly single-handedly took two games off the Lakers in the championship round. Though he had some big nights in the playoffs—including his iconic 40-point triple double in Game 3 of the Finals—Butler wasn’t asked to be a traditional scorer for Miami in 2020. He averaged a modest-for-a-perimeter-star 19.9 points a game during the regular season, but he compensated by adding 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds a night, both career-bests. Butler showed a knack for controlling the game when the Heat needed him to the most. With a shaky jump shot, he turned in a Harden-esque 9.1 free-throw attempts a game, willing himself to the line whenever his team needed a bucket throughout the season. For all his past escapades, Butler was measured his first season in Miami, picking his spots offensively while playing his typical stellar defense on whoever was in front of him. (And for what it’s worth, the only other players with at least a 19.5-6.5-6.0 statline with better than 45% shooting were Luka, LeBron, Russ, and Jokic.)What Butler proved during the Heat’s surprise run through the East is that he can be the No. 1 player on a championship contender. Few players—even some above Butler on this list—can confidently make that claim. If there are any concerns, it’s that at 31-years-old, Butler is no spring chicken. His jump shot is a valid issue. And for all the leadership he brings, he’s not going to put up the numbers of an MVP candidate.Still, when the stakes were at their absolute highest, Butler delivered. And he did so with aplomb, flashing playmaking, defense, rebounding, and of course scoring in the Finals, giving LeBron a legitimate run for his money. Some people are already calling Miami’s playoff run a fluke. As for Butler? He told SI he has something up his sleeve for next season. And only it’s getting harder to doubt Butler’s will.10. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ersFew bigs, if any, are currently as dominant as the 76ers center. Embiid bullies smaller defenders and is too skilled for those who might be a closer physical comparison. Around the rim, he is a foul-drawing machine and additionally led the league in post-up points with 7.4 per game. Embiid also provides the Sixers with a consistent bail-out option, having taken the most field goal attempts per game with between zero and four seconds on the shot clock last season, making 41.5% of them. While Embiid saw a number of his counting stats decrease this past season, he’s poised for an uptick alongside a revised core that now features a number of sharpshooters, with the Sixers’ notably adding Danny Green and Seth Curry in trades this offseason, hoping to free up more space for Embiid around the basket. While durability remains a concern for the 26-year-old center, Embiid could very well be the best big in basketball. Don’t be surprised if he leads the Sixers toward a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference and a deep postseason run. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated9. Luka Dončić, Dallas MavericksThere’s an abundance of ways to contextualize the incredible things Luka Dončić has accomplished by age 21. Suffice it to say, there’s a high likelihood what we’re witnessing is the emergence of the NBA’s next true alpha talent, and a player who could conceivably be in contention for the No. 1 spot on this list a year from now. He lands ninth on our list out of respect to the players ahead of him, but Dončić is closing in quickly, and, truthfully, you could make a compelling case for ranking him as high as fourth or fifth. At this point, it’s a matter of preference, a testament to the speed and manner in which he’s captured the attention and respect of his peers, and his savant-level capacity to control, and increasingly, take over the flow of a given game. It takes a truly unusual combination of focus and skill to function comfortably at the intersection of high usage and high efficiency, and it’s a challenge most players never master. Dončić is already there.In just his second NBA season, Dončić averaged 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists, made first-team All-NBA and the All-Star team, finished fourth in MVP voting and was the focal point of the most efficient NBA offense ever recorded. In two years, he’s worked his way up to 18th on the all-time triple-double list, having passed players including Draymond Green, Kobe Bryant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If there’s a legitimate knock on him right now, it’s his 31.6% three-point clip, stemming from degree-of-difficulty attempts that defenses will often live with (conversely, he converted 57% of attempts inside the arc). But Dončić is a fearless enough shooter that you can’t leave him open, and his floor game is otherwise a challenge to pick apart, considering his exceptional passing skills and unselfish nature (he also finished third in assists per game). He’s not fleet of foot, but his sheer size helps protect him defensively. He looked capable of pushing the Clippers to the brink in the playoffs, before injuries, fatigue and bad luck derailed the Mavericks.The scary part here, of course, is how much time Doncic has to keep adjusting and improving, with the rest of the league throwing the book at him in the meantime. At this early stage of his career, everything is seemingly within his reach. What’s crystal clear is that his superstardom is concrete, and that there’s assuredly more to come. —J.W.8. Nikola Jokić, Denver NuggetsThe steady evolution of Nikola Jokić has been one of the NBA’s most delightful story lines in recent years. The Serbian center was the subject of fascination early in his career, showing flashes of brilliance despite his doughy frame. But as Jokić’s stature grew, so did the questions surrounding his long-term ceiling. Is he fit enough to survive extended playoff series? Can he command games as a scorer? Can you win with a center as your leading man in the modern era? Jokić has answered all those questions with relative ease. The 2019 playoffs served as the greatest affirmation of Jokić’s brilliance. He became the second player in NBA history to average 25 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in a single playoffs, and his 64-minute triple-double against the Blazers served as a watershed moment in his career. Jokić doesn’t necessarily look the part of a franchise anchor. But he remains one in every sense of the word.Jokić’s offensive brilliance is infectious. He’s arguably the greatest passing big of all time, averaging seven assists per game in each of the last two seasons. But it’s not necessarily the assist volume that sets Jokić apart. He dishes dimes from every conceivable angle, throwing looping passes to cutters and lasers to perimeter shooters. There’s a skittishness evident with defenses that play against Jokić. Take a step toward the paint, and an open three will be generated. Stay put on the perimeter, and Jokić is ready to punish a defender on the low block. Jokic isn’t just unselfish. He’s downright gleeful to feed his teammates. It’s hard to imagine a better superstar alongside Jamal Murray in Denver.Denver’s resident behemoth is more than just a transcendent passer. He’s evolved into a punishing presence at the rim, averaging a healthy 1.06 points per possession on postups and 1.03 points per possession as a roll man in 2019–20. Jokić can catch the ball in traffic and put it on the floor. He’s a gifted interior passer, and his midrange jumper is more refined by the year. Jokić occasionally suffers from what we’ll call Marc Gasol syndrome. He’ll pass up open triples in search of feeding his teammates, though that unselfishness can occasionally be counterproductive. Jokić isn’t a knock-down shooter, but his reticence appears to be hampering his percentages to a degree. Few players in the NBA sport better instincts on the floor. Jokic should be unafraid to let it fly. The more command of the offense he takes, the better. —M.S.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated7. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles LakersWhile LeBron James was the unquestioned No. 1 on the Lakers, Anthony Davis was the key to unlocking the team’s success. His versatility, particularly on the defensive end on the floor, essentially served as a cheat code for the Lakers’ coaching staff. Frank Vogel could play big, small, shooters, non-shooters. Seemingly none of it mattered because Davis’s game largely covered up for any perceived deficiencies elsewhere in the lineup. AD will be a bonafide Defensive Player of the Year candidate for many seasons to come. He shifted between power forward and center in 2020, and he was the ultimate eraser for the Lakers. Vogel could cook up aggressive schemes because Davis served as the ultimate backline defender, punishing those who dared to challenge him in the paint. The Lakers rarely relied on switching, and their stay-at-home mentality banked on the fact Davis could roam and wreak havoc when necessary. AD could also guard perimeter stars, like he did when he matched up with Jimmy Butler in the Finals, or Kawhi Leonard during the regular season. Only two or three players in the world right now are as impactful as Davis when he’s locked in on the defensive end, and frankly that skill alone makes him an incredibly valuable player.But of course, there’s the offensive component. James recently told SI the Lakers thought Davis was hardly breaking a sweat at times when putting up monster numbers. AD’s game is effortless on the surface, but the devil is in the details, particularly his footwork. He can abuse more lumbering bigs with turnarounds, jab steps, and quick bursts. He can bully smaller defenders on the block. He looked like Dirk Nowitzki at times with his midrange jumper during the postseason. And Davis also has the ability to stretch his game out to the three-point line, though he’s so effective from the elbow down it almost seems unfair when he’s also connecting from distance. Like many greats, Davis is obsessed with constantly adding flourishes to his game. He’s only 27 years old, which means the contract extension he recently inked will carry him through the smack dab of his prime. The players above Davis on this list have either been the No. 1 guy on a championship team or won MVP (or both.) The odds are AD will join that club sooner rather than later. — R.NWendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports6. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets All signs would seem to indicate that we’re getting something close to the full Durant experience this season. He’s far enough removed from his torn Achilles that expectations are running high. There’s certainly some hope built into this ranking, but we’re talking about one of the greatest scorers in league history, and a player whose size, skill and pure shooting ability give him a chance to age more than gracefully as he plays out his remaining prime years in Brooklyn. Durant is one of maybe a handful of players who are true threats to score the ball no matter where they stand on the floor nor how you choose to defend them. He’s always been able to simply shoot over you when he wants to, and he makes those shots most of the time. The magic lies in the consistency and inevitability of those points, particularly when games matter most. His decision to join the Warriors will always be controversial, but the results he got in Golden State should not be. Now, Durant’s time with the Nets—the third phase of his career—may prove to be the most complicated test he’s faced.So, what’s next? Durant has said he’ll spend time at center this season. Brooklyn’s apparent willingness to experiment, and his apparent lack of minutes restriction, bodes well for the state of his body. The truth is that he’s always transcended positions, because he’s seven feet tall and is probably going to score on whoever’s defending him. But the thought of him working more as a screener and the focal point of a five-out offense is certainly intriguing food for thought. As Durant continues to age, the value he brings defensively will continue to diminish. You might also see his playmaking skills and rebounding trend upward as his responsibilities change. Health is a serious caveat, but if we’re simply picking teams for this season, it’s hard to take Durant any lower than this. If he truly returns to form, this placement will look a little conservative. —J.W.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Stephen Curry, Golden State WarriorsFor some reason, there’s a section of NBA fans who want to shovel dirt on Stephen Curry. They think he needs to prove something this upcoming season, that he has to show he can still be a superstar-level player without Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant by his side. It’s blasphemous. Curry remains one of the most electric players in the NBA, and his shooting ability endures as one of the most impactful forces in league history.Curry played in only five games last season, but there’s no reason to believe he’s not fully recovered from the broken hand that caused him to miss most of the year. If anything, the long layoff should help Curry, whose body could have likely could have used a break after five straight Finals trips. Critics will point to Golden State’s early struggles in the first post-Durant year as evidence that Curry can’t be a traditional No. 1 guy. That strain of thought completely ignores the context of last year’s Warriors roster, which was hastily reassembled after Thompson’s ACL tear and Durant’s departure. Just because Curry doesn’t have the build, look, or style of a typical perimeter star doesn’t mean he’s any less effective. His gravity alone on the offensive side of the ball completely changes the calculus of any defense. For as great as players like LeBron, KD, or Kawhi are, when have you ever seen an opponent try to slow them down with a box-and-one? Curry is obviously a killer with the ball in his hands because he’s a threat to pull up at any moment, but his off-ball work—his cutting, screening, and constant motion—is just as beautiful to watch. Few stars of his caliber are committed to that style of play. And the attention he draws when he sets a proper screen makes life immeasurably easier for his teammates. Curry could score 15 points in a game and still be the reason for an elite offensive performance because of everything he does for his team. And for all the concerns about his defense, he continues to compensate for his relative lack of size by being in the right place at the right time and an engaged team defender. At 32, Curry may very well be nearing the end of his prime. Still, shooting often ages gracefully. And with all the chatter about his status as a No. 1 perhaps serving as extra motivation, Curry should be primed for at least one more great season. — R.N4. James Harden, Houston RocketsStrip away the aesthetic debate and a simple truth emerges regarding James Harden. Houston’s leading man is arguably the greatest scorer of the century, and at this point in his career, Harden remains a walking playoff berth. The 2017–18 MVP enters this season with 11 straight postseason appearances and three straight scoring titles, posting one of the most impressive scoring resumes in league history. Just three players have tallied more 40-point games. Harden could pass Kobe Bryant for the third-most 50-point performances this season, and he has a good shot of passing Michael Jordan for the No. 2 spot in the coming seasons. Harden does benefit from obscene volume, but can you really blame Houston for tailoring its offense to the Harden show? The past eight years have represented arguably the best stretch in franchise history thanks to Harden’s brilliance.It’s not necessarily the scoring totals that makes the Harden experience so jarring. It’s the way he’s completely warped defenses in recent seasons. His dominant step-back has forced opponents to shade their coverage to a hilarious degree, placing defenders firmly on his left hip to prevent the game’s most unstoppable move. When one defender fails, defenses opt for a new strategy entirely. The 2019–20 season brought the emergence of the Harden trap, in which teams would double-team Harden before he even stepped past half-court. Harden has a legitimate statistical case as the greatest scorer of this century. But the way he’s defended may be the greatest testament to his greatness. Just as Michael Jordan required his own unique coverage decades ago, opponents fully embraced the Harden Rules to a shocking degree in 2019–20.Harden’s offensive brilliance will earn him a bust in Springfield and potentially a statue in Houston when all is said and done. But will the Harden experience be remembered as much for its frustrations as its brilliance? Harden remains an imperfect player despite it all. He’s often unwilling to make any impact without the ball in his hands, far too content to rest with his hands on his hips in the half-court. Harden’s postseason failures have been noted ad nauseum, and while there is some context necessary, it’s hard to shake the feeling that there is a gear missing with the season on the line. Harden disappeared in a 2017 exit against San Antonio. He couldn’t stop the stream of missed triples vs. Golden State in 2018, and he was outdueled by Steph Curry down the stretch one year later. Perhaps Harden’s struggles are exacerbated by his unique style. Perhaps the talent around him is to blame. Regardless, Harden’s contention window in Houston appears to have come to a close. We’ll see if he can reverse his career narrative in a new location sooner than later. —M.S.3. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles ClippersOn any given night, Kawhi Leonard can be the best basketball player in the universe. Though his first year with the Clippers ultimately ended in massive disappointment, Leonard showed numerous times throughout 2020 why some had moved him ahead of LeBron before the season. Kawhi is a steely assassin, an expert at getting to his spots when he needs a bucket. He’s at his most enjoyable to watch when he puts teams away by himself, going on these mini flurries at the ends of halves, forcing opponents into submission with his unstoppable elbow jumper. Leonard is a master at playing on his schedule. He can lull you into a false sense of confidence because at first glance his style of play is not overwhelming. But once he finds a weakness to exploit, he is ruthless in his execution.With the Clips, Kawhi improved on the campaign that landed him a Finals MVP in Toronto. He averaged a career-best 27.1 points per game, shooting a robust 47% from the field and 37.8% from three. The defense remains suffocating when he wants it to be, even if Kawhi isn’t a pure stopper as he was early in his career. (Nobody with that much of an offensive burden really is.) Leonard also made great strides as a playmaker, recording a career-high 4.9 assists a night. Playing without a great point guard for really the first time in his career, the Clippers asked Leonard to be more of a ball-handler in 2020, and he acquitted himself well as a passer when drawing extra defenders. That added element to his game made the Clips really deadly when they had their full complement of players, as Kawhi was adept at finding his numerous shooters when needed. (If anything, the Clippers’ early playoff exit showed that Leonard could afford to be even more aggressive. Perhaps it’s not his preference, but he’s more than capable of running constant pick-and-rolls to exploit matchups.)Ultimately, there’s a reason why Leonard, before the age of 30, has gotten the best of guys like Durant, Steph, LeBron, and Giannis in the playoffs—it’s because he’s really damn good. All the players listed there have also had disappointing playoff losses, by the way. Don’t let what happened in the bubble convince you that Leonard isn’t still on the level of the elite of the elite. — R.NGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks There’s no shame here in Giannis ceding the top spot on our list, and it may not take much for him to reclaim it. He offers more on a nightly basis than any player in the league. He’s a seven-foot-tall athletic marvel, and his ballyhooed quest to make the Finals cannot be held against him in an exercise like this. There may not be a player in the league, from stars to scrubs, who pours as much of himself into a given game than Antetokounmpo. Using his length, explosiveness and intelligence, he dominates the interior, he breeds transition offense, he finds teammates, and he wins games. There are games where his jumper doesn’t fall — the only true critique of his game at age 26 — but Antetokounmpo doesn’t take nights off. It is noteworthy that those shooting woes tend to manifest in the playoffs, when opponents wall off the paint and take their chances. The consecutive, unceremonious exits are blots on his ledger. But there is also room for improvement, and in the context of a player who so genuinely cares about being great, we should be optimistic that the jumper will come. (Plus, he’s pretty damn effective without it).Antetokounmpo continues to improve each year, launching those threes more often than ever before, getting to the foul line more, rebounding better and making even more of his minutes, all while shouldering a league-high 37.5% usage rate in 2019–20. After all, this is the two-time reigning MVP and the Defensive Player of the Year. Where many of the league’s stars have plateaued in their 20s, Antetokounmpo continues to add wrinkles to his game. It will only continue to slow down for him. His production is the NBA’s most valuable constant. He comes in second here, only because arguably the greatest player in league history has yet to slow down in any meaningful way. So this is where we leave Giannis, as more 1B than true No. 2. —J.W.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated1. LeBron James, Los Angeles LakersIt’s been 18 years of LeBron James, and we are spoiled. The King has now spent nearly half of his entire life in the NBA. He has little left to prove in terms of individual accolades or statistics. His sheer longevity speaks for itself. And after piloting the Lakers to a title, adjusting his game yet again to make it happen, he regains the top spot in this ranking after briefly ceding it a year ago. The mind-boggling amount of mileage on his body weighs on your mind, the half-step he’s lost athletically crops up time and again, and James can’t just flip the switch quite the way he used to. He requires maintenance and rest. He’ll take plays off defensively and weeks off mentally. At this point, these are things we have to simply accept. The meaty LeBron discourse can be picked clean from any angle. It can be exhausting. His case as the No. 1 player in an exercise like this no longer feels or reads as an absolute truth. Yet it remains the logical answer, knowing all that we know about who he is when the challenge boils down to winning or losing a game.As last season reminded us, in any contest with stakes, there’s not another player you’d take ahead of James. He’s the best player on the planet when he wants to be. And when things matter, that’s always going to be what he wants. The Lakers are favorites to repeat for that reason. LeBron led the NBA in assists for the first time as a 35-year-old, and it didn’t happen by accident. That vision and wherewithal isn’t going to be what fails him. James still finds ways to swing the outcome of games in unexpected fashion. When there are great players around him, he doesn’t simply fit with them—he takes their play to another level. While still giving full credit to Anthony Davis, everyone knows that his on-court life has never been easier, with James on the floor to dictate where the ball should be, to draw defenses, and maximize the quality and ease of his shot attempts. The Lakers’ championship doesn’t happen without that level of synergy. It all still revolves around LeBron, in a way no other player can replicate. He’s proven that it will not be his brain or his skills that lead to his decline. It’s a different brand of dominance now, but the impact and the weight of his influence remain unmatched when things count. It’s all about the end result.How much longer James will hold the top spot is anyone’s guess, and going into this season, there are plenty of comers. But it feels certain that this is not the time to take it from him. And that’s where we’ve landed. —J.W.Over 50,000 students will have the opportunity to profit off their name, image and likeness (NIL) under a new Adidas initiative.Randle has more than $155,000 worth of fines from the NBA this campaign.Thursday\\'s Sweet 16 Best Bets and Odds: Bank on Villanova and GonzagaVarious former World No. 1 players praised the Australian for her accomplishments in her career.The retired fighter received the charges based off an incident that occurred on Dec. 18.Who is the real transfer portal king in college football?

       " 'Stephen Curry Ranks as NBA’s Most-Liked Player Ahead of 2021-22 SeasonThe Golden State Warriors have missed the playoffs each of the last two NBA seasons, but that hasn’t stunted the popularity of the face of the franchise, Stephen Curry.

Like in years past, voters were given a simple/painful task: Rank the best 25 players in the NBA today. Only this year, we limited the panel to our pool of regular analysts: Dan Devine, J. Kyle Mann, Rob Mahoney, and Kevin O’Connor. Resident stats wizard Zach Kram also chipped in “By the numbers” analysis for each player of the list, and a video debating the top spot will drop in the coming weeks. Without further ado, the results, based on average ranking, are as follows. (All stats through Sunday; all records through Monday.)Team: Timberwolves (20-45) | Position: Big 24.8 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.3 blocks, 55.7 eFG%, -2.8 net rating, 43 GPJ. Kyle Mann: If we were simply asking “Who’s the best player on the planet?” I think KAT is low. He might be the best volume shooting center in the history of basketball, and although he’s diverged from the track that we expected for him initially, we shouldn’t let that distract us from the significance of that accolade. We’ve had 59 instances of a center posting a season with at least 200 3-point attempts, and Karl owns five of the top seven most efficient seasons, 2020-21 being one of them. Overall—nah, this isn’t exactly the mind-boggling prime output season that we might want from one of our foremost offensive frontcourt talents, but he’s still critical to Minnesota’s ... is “success” the word? We’ll call it “relative stability.” The Wolves are plus-9.9 points per 100 possessions with Towns on the court. This roster would be lost in the timber without him. We often think of Towns as a stiff-hipped pull-up shooter or a back-you-down-and-baby-hook-you post scorer (a.k.a. “The Kenny Payne Special”), but I don’t think KAT gets enough credit for the things he does in the spaces between, specifically his footwork when navigating traffic and getting to the rim. New coach Chris Finch has Towns operating away from the basket, which allows KAT to attack the basket and create more than ever, and is it possible that we’ve also underrated his creativity as a passer?Towns has been a productive kite in a hurricane for the past few seasons, but with the growth of Anthony Edwards, the thrilling surprise of Jaden McDaniels, and D’Angelo Russell’s early success playing next to KAT, the Wolves quietly seem like they’re a piece away from at least being interesting. By the numbers: There are just five seasons in NBA history in which a player averaged double-digit rebounds and at least 2.5 3-pointers per game. Two of them belong to Towns: last season and this season.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Guard17.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.7 steals, 56.9 eFG%, 9.2 net rating, 52 GPDan Devine: The price Milwaukee paid for Holiday—in terms of both the players and draft picks they sent to New Orleans during the offseason, and the nine-figure extension they gave him last month—was mighty steep. But it’s hard to argue that he hasn’t been worth the money thus far, given both how beautifully he’s fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton … and how brilliantly he performed without Giannis when the two-time MVP was out nursing a knee injury.With Giannis in and out of the lineup for a 13-game stretch starting on March 22, Holiday averaged 25.7 points, 8.2 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per 36 minutes of non-Giannis floor time. His usage spiked in those non-Giannis minutes, and his shooting exploded from “most efficient of his career” to “absolutely scorching.” It was a small sample born out of necessity, but when needed, he produced—a 27 percent usage rate, 34 percent assist rate, 65.4 true shooting—like one of the most devastating offensive forces in the league.We tend to think of Jrue as an all-world defender and complementary playmaker; we don’t think of him like that. Seeing it in action, though, made me appreciate why so many people have for so long described Holiday as the most underrated player in the league—and helped make it crystal clear why the Bucks both forked over a king’s ransom to get him and backed up the Brink’s truck to keep him.By the numbers: When Holiday was injured midseason, the Bucks lost five games in a row. With Holiday on the court, the Bucks haven’t lost more than two in a row all season.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Big19.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.1 blocks, 57.0 eFG%, 1.1 net rating, 58 GPDevine: Time and again, guards work switches against Miami’s defense, drawing Adebayo out into deep water in isolation, thinking they’re going to torch him like they do to the plodding bigs plugging the middle elsewhere in the NBA. And time and again, they learn what Couper Moorhead of Heat.com calls “the Lesson”—that Bam ain’t those other plodding bigs, and that trying to attack him one-on-one isn’t a mismatch ... at least, not in the way that they thought.This is a very loud way for Devin Booker to learn #TheLesson. pic.twitter.com/pzdyWlM8IgAdebayo switches on screens more often than any other player in the league, and more than holds his own, even against the league’s best guards. Even while shouldering a larger-than-ever share of the offensive burden in Miami this season, Bam hasn’t lost the defensive tenacity and malleability that made the Heat fall in love with him coming out of Kentucky. If anything, he’s gotten even better on that end, cementing his reputation as one of the game’s most complete stoppers with every new lesson he teaches.By the numbers: After splitting time between power forward and center in the 2019-20 regular season, Adebayo moved fully to center for the Heat’s playoff run. He’s stayed there in 2020-21, spending 99 percent of his minutes at the 5, per Cleaning the Glass.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Guard26.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.0 steals, 52.0 eFG%, 7.9 net rating, 53 GPRob Mahoney: There’s something a bit tragic about the defender who feels he’s done enough—after watching film, digesting the scouting report, and zeroing in with complete focus—only to find himself deep in a stance on the perimeter, waiting for Mitchell to make the first move. So much of what Mitchell creates begins this way, with the Jazz guard theoretically well covered by what are often bigger, longer defenders. Then the theory breaks. Mitchell stutter steps by or slams his defender into a screen. Maybe he just dribbles right past by attacking a half-beat earlier than expected. Where he distinguishes himself is through literal separation; high-level playoff defenses might challenge Mitchell to make split-second reads against layers of evolving coverage, but even those schemes operate under the assumption that the first layer is pretty much toast.Only four players in the league this season have scored more unassisted points than Mitchell, according to data from PBP Stats—notable not only for its sheer volume, but the contrast between that sort of iso scoring and the way Utah runs its offense more broadly. The Jazz sustain themselves through the patience of their ball movement, but in moments of desperation, they simplify their attack to beat the clock or minimize risk. It’s Mitchell who allows them to change gears as needed, merging the ideals of Utah’s system with the practicalities of an NBA game through the pressure he applies with a live dribble.By the numbers: Mitchell is the fourth Jazz player to reach 25 points per game in a season. The other three—Karl Malone, Adrian Dantley, and Pete Maravich—are all in the Hall of Fame.Team: Knicks (37-28) | Position: Big24.2 points, 10.3 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 0.3 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 3.7 net rating, 63 GPKevin O’Connor: An open mind has changed Randle’s career. After six seasons of mixed returns, Randle altered his tendencies in a way that has dramatically improved his game. No longer is he an unreliable defender who loses focus and lets his intensity waver. This season, Randle became one of the NBA’s most impactful and versatile defenders. He stays focused and hustles—habits that have even improved throughout the season. In the past, Randle was a black hole whenever he got an offensive touch. It disgusted fans whenever he’d barrel into a crowded paint instead of finding an open teammate. Now, he’s a playmaking hub for the Knicks, and he’s even becoming a go-to scorer because of his improved shot.Randle is now one of the best players in the NBA, and that’s all due to his mindset and the work he put in to find a new version of himself. There’s a lesson in there for all of us.By the numbers: Randle isn’t just scoring and shooting and passing better than ever before. He’s also played 113 minutes more than any other player—basically the equivalent of three extra games.Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Wing25.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.7 eFG%,7.6 net rating, 60 GPMahoney: There are scorers with a signature, and then there are scorers like Booker—comfortable in so many spaces and actions that it can be a challenge to decide how to even defend them. Booker can beat you by curling into midrange jumpers; he can exploit matchups by posting smaller guards; he can make longer wings chase him around screens, only to change directions and attack the basket once they catch up. Playing with Chris Paul helps him to leverage all of those threats in phases throughout the course of a game, but only because Booker’s breadth of ability is the skeleton key.There’s proof of that in the Suns’ minutes without Paul, when Booker runs even more pick-and-roll and keeps the offense absolutely sizzling. It doesn’t really matter whether he’s surrounded by starters or reserves; there’s always a way for Booker to get going, to improvise a bucket through relentless creativity. As a genuine three-level scorer, his power comes from possession. Defenders don’t have much choice but to take every hesitation and shot fake seriously. The next one could be the pull-up that puts the game away.By the numbers: Booker is one of eight players in NBA history with 9,000 career points through their age-24 season. The others? LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Anthony Davis, and Shaquille O’Neal.Team: Wizards (30-35) | Position: Guard31.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.2 steals, 53.1 eFG%, -1.1 net rating, 55 GPMann: Some time ago my wife and I went to a Mexican restaurant on a random weeknight to snag a bite, and we (luckily) wandered into what appeared to be the saddest karaoke night of all time. At one point a middle-aged guy resembling George R.R. Martin got up, quietly ambled across the brightly colored room to hand his CD to the DJ, and waited silently on stage for his instrumental cue. The track was immediately recognizable. It was “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” I was elated, because I expected something epically terrible and wildly entertaining. Joke was on me—it was amazing. He was obviously technically gifted, but this guy also fucking performed. The thing that really struck me, aside from his brilliance, was that his dazzling talent seemed totally out of place in this ordinary restaurant that barely clapped when he was finished. I feel like that sometimes when I’m watching Bradley Beal. I’m not saying Wizards fans don’t appreciate Beal—they adore him—and the second half of April has been fun for them, whipping up on some of the younger teams. It’s just that there are nights on League Pass when I see Beal, now hitting his absolute prime at 27 years old, on a team that’s 30-35, and think, we’ve got to get this guy in an environment where meaningful basketball is being played. To quote Colin Powell: A prime is a terrible thing to waste. OK, he didn’t actually say that, but the point stands. Beal’s 31.0 PPG (on 59.4 percent TS)—second behind Steph Curry in scoring—and his 3.3 BPM is a career high. It’s important to fully digest how dynamic Beal is. This is not a guy who you just run a weak-side pindown for or have him stand on the wing and hope he’s hitting shots off the catch. He can kill you that way, but Beal’s off-the-bounce footwork and economy of movement are among the best in the league. He’s deceptively fast on his first and second steps, and his head-and-shoulder hesitation bag is deep and lethal. He’s like a chess player who knows how many moves it’ll take to bring you down, and he refuses to stray from that design.Beal has also blossomed into a productive pick-and-roll scorer (.984 PPP, 79th percentile, per Synergy) in the decline and subsequent departure of John Wall. His reps in that area have surged in the past two seasons, and he’s been particularly productive in high ball screens, where he’s one of the most efficient players in the league at attacking the basket and getting to the line consistently. The Wizards fans I know seem content: They’ve enjoyed this guy, but moving on is understandable at this point. He’s a special prize who, if they move him, will hopefully yield a special return. By the numbers: Beal is the 12th player in NBA history to score 30-plus points per game in consecutive seasons. The first 11 comprise 10 Hall of Famers and James Harden.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Big14.4 points, 13.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 2.8 blocks, 67.9 eFG%, 15.4 net rating, 64 GPO’Connor: When you think about Gobert, what’s the first thing that pops into your mind? For some people, it’s Curry putting him in the spin cycle. Or maybe more recently, it’s him leaving D’Angelo Russell wide open to win a game. These lowlights go viral, while his moments of brilliance so rarely get noticed. Gobert induces fear into opponents when he’s lurking around the rim. The Jazz allow only 0.85 points per pick-and-roll when Gobert is defending the screen, which Second Spectrum says is the league’s highest mark of players to log at least 400 plays. It’s his presence that makes Utah third best in defensive rating this season.On offense, the threat of him flushing an alley-oop causes defenses to collapse into the paint and free up shooters. He might not shoot 3s, but he’s the reason teammates are able to get so many wide-open looks from behind the arc. The focus is often on what Gobert doesn’t do instead of what he does, which is unfortunate. But Gobert will keep on producing, even if no one is noticing.By the numbers: On shots within 6 feet of the basket, opposing players are shooting 14 percentage points worse than expected with Gobert as the closest defender, per NBA.com—the greatest differential for any player who’s defended at least 250 shots.Team: Celtics (34-31) | Position: Wing26.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.1 steals, 53.1 eFG%, 2.9 net rating, 58 GPMahoney: What a strange season it’s been for Tatum, who tested positive for COVID back in January, returned to one of the most turbulent Celtics seasons in recent memory, and then moved his game forward while managing lingering, long-haul symptoms. Just a few weeks ago, Tatum revealed that he’s been using an inhaler before games to help with his breathing. You wouldn’t know he needed it by the way he’s cutting, posting, and breaking down defenders—especially as his production hit season-high marks in April. As always, it’s the balance that impresses most. Tatum is the kind of star who keeps every option open, allowing teammates to be their best selves and Celtics coach Brad Stevens to troubleshoot as needed. If it’s easiest for Tatum to go to work from the midpost or top of the arc, he can—but his game is no less effective if he’s moved around the floor, across positions, or between defensive matchups. Any two-way player of Tatum’s size is an incredible strategic luxury, but his technical prowess has made him indispensable. The only reason Boston’s season feels underwhelming is because Tatum is good enough to raise expectations.By the numbers: Tatum has more than doubled his assist rate from two seasons ago, from 10 percent of teammates’ baskets to 21 this season.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard26.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.3 steals, 56.4 eFG%, 5.4 net rating, 48 GPMann: Irving’s enigmatic existence as a hoops star is bizarre and somewhat unprecedented, to the point that it’s difficult to have a conversation purely about him as a basketball player. But the fact remains that Irving is still one of the most impactful offensive players on the planet. His multifaceted scoring—driven by his command of misdirection and his ability to decelerate hard in the middle portion of the floor—makes him extremely difficult to cover on an island, in open space. With heavy-load scorers next to him, his versatility is especially hard to take away. It’s been typical volume and typical efficiency from Irving, but he’s as active as ever getting downhill. He’s scored more points in the paint than ever before, and among jump shooters who’ve put up 400-plus attempts, Irving is seventh in the league in field goal percentage. He’s also fifth in isolation points per chance at 1.138. What Brooklyn as a whole has done this season is equally bizarre and unprecedented—not since Wynton Marsalis and Willie Nelson teamed up (just go with it) have we had megastars come together on a big stage with virtually no rehearsal time, but that’s what KD, Kyrie, and the Beard are doing. This trio has played a whopping 186 minutes together in only seven games, and yet the Nets are second in the East at 43-22, and Irving is the most consistent producer throughout that time. It speaks to the talent and experience of these three stars that the general assumption is that they’ll still be extremely difficult to stop from reaching the Finals.By the numbers: Evidence of the lethality of Irving’s shooting: He’s at 38.1 percent from 3 this season, which is comfortably above average in the NBA … yet his worst 3-point percentage in half a decade.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Wing21.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.1 steals, 50.7 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 48 GPDevine: Jimmy entered the bubble last summer as a five-time All-Star widely regarded as one of the finest two-way players in the sport. Inside, he became something more, fully embracing the odd-as-hell circumstances, fueling Miami’s thrilling run to the Finals, and authoring a pair of unforgettable performances against the Lakers before bowing out. The Heat, on the whole, have struggled in fits and starts this season to try to recapture the magic they found in Disney World.Butler, though? He’s been playing like he never left:Injury, illness, and inconsistency have left holes all over the Heat’s roster this season. Butler has stretched his game to try to fill them, scoring and facilitating efficiently in a larger offensive role while continuing to act as an All-Defensive Team–caliber stopper on opponents’ top options. I’m not sure the Heat will find enough answers by the play-in games to replicate last season’s run. I am sure, though, that I would want nothing to do with a win-or-go-home game against Jimmy, who showed in the bubble he’s good enough to be the best player on any floor he steps on, and who’s spent this season proving that wasn’t a fluke.By the numbers: Butler is shooting just 20.4 percent on 3-pointers, yet he’s still averaging 21.5 points per game. That’s the worst long-range accuracy for any of the 30 qualified players this season averaging at least 20 points. Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing23.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 56.0 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 49 GPMahoney: As a public figure, George can be rather bumbling—tripping through odd sound bites, needless excuses, and one inexplicable beef after another. As a player, he’s just smooth as hell. The second act of George’s career began when he really cleaned up his handle, and ever since, he’s shown how easy scoring 20 points a night can be. This is his most efficient season yet. Whether he’s handling the ball or angling to get open, George moves at a glide, slinking around defenders and through traffic. His game is just smooth enough to be occasionally frustrating. If you can get anywhere you want on the floor, why not get to the rim? It’s an easy criticism, and given the way George produces and defends, a largely irrelevant one. Plus, if your jumper looked this good, you might just fall in love with it, too.The truth is that George does so much more to paper over the Clippers’ limitations than he’s given credit for, starting with the way he’s shared playmaking duties for one of the highest-achieving offenses in the league. His all-around game gives a weird, somewhat flawed roster the credentials of a serious contender.By the numbers: Out of 28 players this season attempting at least seven 3-pointers per game, Steph Curry is naturally first in accuracy. George is second.Team: Pelicans (29-36) | Position: Point Big27.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.6 blocks, 62.1 eFG%, 1.8 net rating, 59 GPO’Connor: What a privilege it is to watch this man hoop. Only 20 years old and averaging a Shaq-like stat line of 27 points on 62 percent from the field. He’s a dominant force who keeps getting better. This season, we’ve seen Zion morph into a playmaker who brings the ball up the court and runs pick-and-roll. Amazingly, he still has so much untapped upside to be unleashed—as long as he continues to develop his ball handling and jumper, and the pieces around him improve.By the numbers: Williamson is taking 13.3 shots per game in the restricted area. That’s 2.2 more attempts than anyone else in any season in the play-by-play era (dating back to 1996-97).Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Guard16.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.4 steals, 55.2 eFG%, 6.5 net rating, 63 GPDevine: The bubble gave us our first indicator that Phoenix would be good. The second, more telling one, though, was that Chris Paul wanted to go there.CP3 doesn’t waste time. He’s here to optimize every second, whether it’s walking the dog to try to preserve possessions late in the game, or dramatically changing his diet to try to recover the step he seemed to be losing as he aged. He proved in a surprising All-NBA turn in Oklahoma City last season that he remains a Chopped grand champion, still capable of taking whatever’s in the cupboard and elevating it, and he looked at a Phoenix roster that already featured Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Mikal Bridges and said, “Yeah, I can work with this.”And work he has, turning in one of the most productive seasons ever by a guard on the wrong side of 35 while serving as the straw that stirs the drink for a dynamite team that has blown away even the most optimistic preseason expectations. Booker’s the headliner, but the Suns operate like a classic CP3 team: slow-paced and careful with the ball, elite in the half court, disciplined on defense, excellent in crunch time. He augments both Phoenix’s poise and its snarl.Bringing in Paul to replace Ricky Rubio promised to raise Phoenix’s floor. But Paul continuing to play at this level also vaults the Suns’ ceiling, all the way up to the rarefied air reserved for title contenders.By the numbers: Paul is taking 63 percent of his shots from the midrange, per Cleaning the Glass—tied for the largest portion in the league. And he’s making 53 percent of them, which ranks in the 95th percentile.Team: Trail Blazers (36-29) | Position: Guard28.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.6 eFG%, 3.1 net rating, 59 GPMahoney: Forgive me for belaboring the Dame Time of it all, but how is it even possible that a 6-foot-2 guard could be so good in the highest-leverage situations as to completely bail out an otherwise one-sided team? The break-even Blazers are one of the NBA’s best outfits in the clutch, owed mostly to Lillard’s daring and shot-making with the game on the line. We really can’t overstate the value of that—especially when Lillard’s late-game performance could be the difference between Portland finishing the season as a play-in team and disastrously sliding out of the picture entirely. The one shot, game on the line conversation can be a bit reductive, but it’s also revealing to see how opponents react to that premise. Lillard can push a playoff-level team to full-on crisis. Panic switches, flailing miscommunications, out-of-character traps—anything and everything is possible when Dame has the ball in his hands late in a close game, and the Blazers rightly trust him not just to hit shots, but to make the best possible decisions. In that capacity, Lillard delivers for the full 48. He manages the game, he investigates the coverage, and when the bell finally tolls, he rips out an opponent’s still-beating heart. By the numbers: Lillard has scored 149 points in clutch situations this season, per NBA.com. That’s 20 more than anyone else.Team: Mavericks (36-28) | Position: Guard28.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.0 steals, 55.6 eFG%, 3.8 net rating, 58 GPO’Connor: Luka placed fourth in MVP voting in 2020 at age 20, in only his second season. It was the greatest sophomore season anyone has ever had, except arguably LeBron when he averaged 27-7-7 in 2004-05. LeBron placed sixth in MVP voting that season and wouldn’t win his first until 2009. Luka won’t win his first in the 2020-21 season, but he belongs in the top-five conversation again because he’s even better than he was last season. He’s better at shooting. He’s better at defense. He’s better at leading a team through adversity. He has carried the Mavericks through Kristaps Porzingis’s absences, a constantly changing rotation due to injuries, and the second-most games missed due to the COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Dallas is competing for a top-six seed in the playoffs largely because of another leap by Luka.By the numbers: Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are the only players in NBA history with multiple All-NBA appearances through their age-21 seasons. Doncic will join them this season.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: Big21.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.8 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 29 GPMann: It’s true that Davis has barely played this season. He missed 30 games starting in mid-February, but he’s still in the conversation for most versatile, utterly dominant two-way frontcourt player in the world. I actually had him ranked much higher.Offensively, it’s been an unremarkable season by Brow’s standards: He’s less active at the rim and he’s leaned heavily on his face-up game. Maybe that’s to avoid risk of injury, but I think that’s eaten into his overall efficiency.Defensively, he’s still a force. AD’s recovery speed, positional intelligence, and general disruptiveness make him one of the most impactful and skilled defenders in the NBA. At full health and fully humming, I don’t think there’s anyone better. It’s a simple calculus: He gives a ton and takes a ton away. Last season, among defenders who logged at least 1,000 possessions guarding screens, Davis had the lowest points per chance allowed in the league at .877. He was only put in position to defend screens 20.04 times per 100 possessions, the second-lowest amount among that sample. In other words, it was a fool’s errand to go at him.His incredible catch radius on the offensive end also allows him to bother or stifle passing activity in and around the paint, and everybody in the league knows it. Driving in Davis’s general direction is enough to create indecision or hesitation. Back in the mid-2000s, Bravo ran a special about the scariest movie moments. In it, panelists described what made watching Jaws so terrifying—after encountering that terror, you were never swimming in open water with a clear mind again. That’s what it’s like to attempt to create offense around Anthony Davis. He lingers in the back of your mind.His efficiencies in this area are down from last season, but the glimpses indicate that he’s still got the ability to flip the switch on in the playoffs. Watch Doncic punt on challenging him initially on this drive, kick it to Kleber, who fakes and drives at Davis and also decides not to attack him. Davis basically makes this a no-fly zone, challenging this skip pass to Luka to the point where its float time allows him to recover and heavily contest the shot. He’s a monster.By the numbers: Davis is struggling with his 3-point percentage in a small sample—but he’s converting at a career-best clip from both the restricted area and the midrange.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 11 assists, 1.3 steals, 54.5 eFG%, 2.7 net rating, 34 GPDevine: “I don’t know, man. It’s been, like, three years of almost nothing but isolation. Can Harden even play regular basketball anymore?”As it turns out: yep.“All right, sure, he can run actual plays and stuff, and he’s willing to cut his usage damn near in half when he plays with KD and Kyrie. But what about when they’re not on the floor? Is he going to be able to carry this team like he did in Houston?”Again: yep.“Wait: So when he’s flanked by Hall of Famers, he lays back and runs the offense like Magic, and when he’s not, he snaps right back to being a do-everything MVP type?”Mm-hmm.“... Shit, that’s pretty impressive.”Yep!By the numbers: Harden leads the league in isolation possessions since moving to Brooklyn, but he’s averaging only eight isos per game—about half of his average in his last two full seasons in Houston. He also ranks in the 86th percentile in isolation efficiency.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Big28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, 59.9 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 54 GPMahoney: Tempting as it may be to think of offense and defense as discrete from one another, every push in transition blurs the line between them. Giannis absolutely dominates these sorts of gray areas. If a smaller opponent has to pick him up in transition, he dunks. If a like-sized defender sprints in his path but meets Giannis too late, he dunks. If the Bucks set a drag screen for Giannis and the defense is forced to switch, he dunks. Overreact in his direction at any time, and a knock-down shooter will get target practice from beyond the arc. You can apply this same sort of no-win logic to many of the game’s in-between spaces, or any scenario that would force a less-than-optimal defender to contend with a titan.His size just makes it too easy for Milwaukee to turn the smallest momentary advantage into the highest-efficiency shots. Quality playoff teams try to minimize those vulnerabilities as best they can, but there’s only so much that can be done to stay out of defensive rotation, where Antetokounmpo can step over smaller guards and create opportunities from offensive rebounds. Any hope that opponents have of creating their own easy points in transition runs into the same massive problem: the reigning Defensive Player of the Year with the same size advantage, ready to meet them at the rim and ruin their day. Chaos is an inescapable part of the NBA game. Giannis has managed to make it his own.By the numbers: Across his two MVP seasons, Giannis averaged 28.5 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. This season, he’s averaging 28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. He’s the same player, with nearly the exact same stat line, as when he won back-to-back MVPs.Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing25.5 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.6 steals, 57.1 eFG%, 11.5 net rating, 47 GPO’Connor: We so often praise Kawhi for his defensive brilliance and his go-to scoring greatness. But he’s also improved over the years as a playmaker. This season, he’s averaging a career-high 5.1 assists and using the pick-and-roll to destroy defenses. Through May 1, 114 players have logged at least 400 possessions as a pick-and-roll ball handler and Leonard ranks first, leading the Clippers to score 1.12 points per chance, according to Second Spectrum. Leonard is still a score-first player, but adding a new dimension to his game has made him deadlier than ever.By the numbers: Leonard is averaging 2.6 assists per turnover this season. The best prior ratio of his career was 1.9.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Big28.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 blocks, 62.4 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 28 GPMann: The buildup to the 2020-21 season was colored by the anxiety of whether or not Durant would be the Slim Reaper whom we’ve watched in awe for the past decade. His season has lacked rhythm in most every sense, but his return to the court has been wildly satisfying, as he’s proved that he’s still one of the world’s most elite shot-makers. He’s been especially efficient in isolation and shooting off the catch, and his effectiveness as an off-the-dribble shooter shows very little sign of having fallen off. Among players attempting at least 100 pull-up jumpers, Durant’s second in the NBA in effective field goal percentage, per Second Spectrum.If the Nets stay healthy and ramp this thing up, they are a gravitational nightmare for opponents. That’s especially nauseating for defenses when you consider that Durant has stared the biggest moments in the sport in the face and coolly plunged the dagger.By the numbers: The last time Durant was healthy, in 2018-19, he had the second-best offensive rating for a team that set a league record for offensive efficiency. This season, Durant is doing one better, with the best offensive rating for a team on pace to set a league record for efficiency.Team: Warriors (33-32) | Position: Guard31.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.2 steals, 60.9 eFG%, 3.2 net rating, 56 GPO’Connor: Despite having the worst supporting cast since Golden State’s run began, Steph is producing comparably to his unanimous MVP season in 2015-16. We are entering a turning point of Curry’s career. An identity crisis looms for the Warriors; James Wiseman has struggled as a rookie, Draymond Green lost his jumper, and Klay Thompson’s future is uncertain following two straight missed seasons. Steph is 33, and the competition in the West is steeper than it’s been … maybe ever. But Curry has proved to still be one of the few talents who can single-handedly lead his team to the playoffs. With a little more help, the Warriors could soon be back in the championship conversation.By the numbers: Among all player-seasons in NBA history with at least a 30 percent usage rate and 1,000 minutes played, the three best true shooting percentages are, in order: Curry in 2018, Curry in 2016, and now Curry in 2021.Team: 76ers (44-21) | Position: Big29.3 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.4 blocks, 54.5 eFG%, 11.3 net rating, 45 GPMahoney: The biggest revolution in Embiid’s game this season was a pivot. As a back-to-the-basket player, the Sixers center was a clear All-Star; as a face-up post player, he might be the most dominant player in the sport. Reorienting his game has allowed Embiid to do more of the heavy manufacturing necessary to really sustain an offense. His usage is up, far ahead of any other center. His scoring is up. His free throw attempts are up. And so long as he continues to hit midrange shots at a 47 percent clip, there’s not really a damn thing a defense can do to stop him. It’s so much harder to pressure Embiid when he’s already positioned to see double teams coming. There’s no blind side left to exploit; any attempt to force the ball out of Embiid’s hands is an invitation for a quick pass out to a wide-open 3-pointer, or a sales opportunity for Embiid to flail through his crowding defenders for yet another trip to the foul line.Yet doubling Embiid might still be the right call—if only because there are so few defenders big enough to get a hand in his face and mobile enough to keep up with his footwork. We know Embiid has entered a rare class because the only options to try to contain him are bad ones. Playing against the Sixers these days just means learning to live with his dominance. By the numbers: Embiid is averaging 12.7 free throw attempts per 36 minutes—breaking a league record held by Wilt Chamberlain since 1961-62, when he tallied 12.6 attempts per 36.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: LeBron25.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 0.6 blocks, 57.8 eFG%, 9.4 net rating, 43 GPMann: I’ve had a fun time fleshing out this list, but I cannot in good conscience allow you people to walk away from any list where LeBron is not no. 1. And listen—I adore Nikola Jokic. I think he’s the most talented offensive center to walk the earth. At the same time, I’m trying to savor these last chances I have to appreciate LeBron, one of the truly great sports brands of all time. Unless you’re a bitter fan or you love these back-and-forth “ringz culture” pissing matches, you should do the same! Rally all of your thoughts behind this American icon!  LeBron is Brad Pitt smiling over the steering wheel in slo-mo in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. LeBron is Coke using Helvetica in a full-page ad.LeBron is one of the surest, most foundational things that we have. Don’t you crave stability and normalcy? What the hell are we doing, doubting him? After the year we’ve had, LeBron winning another title would be like the totem at the end of Inception falling to the table, revealing that we’re back from whatever awful nightmare that just was.All that aside: At 36 years old, it remains incredible that he’s able to uphold the scale of his impact while moving less than ever. It’s hard to blame him. LeBron is hunting rarified accolades, and at this stage of his career, with this many miles on the tires, he has to prioritize staying in the race until the end over sprinting to be clearly ahead at the third stage. He’s the baddest man alive until further notice.By the numbers: When LeBron plays (not counting the game he was hurt early), the Lakers have 14 losses versus 28 wins. When LeBron doesn’t play (or is hurt early), the Lakers also have 14 losses—but with only eight wins.Team: Nuggets (43-22) | Position: Point Big26.2 points, 10.9 rebounds, 8.5 assists, 0.7 blocks, 60.6 eFG%, 7.6 net rating, 64 GPDevine: Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space:That’s a tidy visualization of the degree to which Jokic has separated himself from all other players this season in a slew of advanced metrics—including estimated plus-minus, value over replacement player, box plus-minus, win shares, and FiveThirtyEight’s wins above replacement—to make the most difficult leap in the sport: from All-Star to MVP favorite.The 26-year-old has used Denver’s invigorating run in the bubble as a springboard, coming off his curtailed offseason in the best shape of his career and translating that into one of the most impressive offensive campaigns in NBA history. That’s not hyperbole: Jokic has married scoring efficiency, playmaking volume, and sheer offensive workload to a level that only Magic Johnson, LeBron James, and James Harden have ever reached. This is where I remind you that we are talking about a 6-foot-11, 284-pound center, one I compared three months ago—lovingly and favorably!—to a Mack truck.This year’s model of Jokic is a basketball futurist’s fever dream realized—the myth of the next Dirk Nowitzki and Arvydas Sabonis made manifest in one peerless package. Whether he can carry a wounded Nuggets team through a Western Conference littered with the kind of big-wing playmakers who have come to dominate postseason play remains to be seen; if my life depended on winning one game, I can’t swear he’d be my first pick. If I got him, though, I wouldn’t hate my chances. Because nobody—nobody—has played basketball better this season than Nikola Jokic.By the numbers: Combining points, assists, and screen assists, Jokic has created 58 points per game this season—a whopping five ahead of second place. The only other players above 50 are Harden (53), Doncic (52), Domantas Sabonis (51), Russell Westbrook (51), and Giannis (51). An SB Nation affiliate site',\n",
       " '50 BEST PLAYERS IN THE NBA\\n\\nThere are roughly a million ways to rank and order players in today’s analytically inclined NBA where stats and information can overwhelm those of us who don’t have a degree in quantum physics. Seriously, pick just about any stat or specific skill—like offensive rating, win shares, +/-, or shooting percentage on corner threes—and we can neatly order the 500-plus players who will be on an NBA roster this season into a coherent hierarchy.But when wading into a topic as arbitrary, and often inflammatory, as who are the NBA’s 50 best players, you often reach a state of chaos before ever approaching any sort of consensus. Which, honestly, is the way it should be when the rankings rely largely on the eye test mixed in with a few other factors.While it’s kind of an absurd proposition, of course, to accurately and definitively order basketball’s best players, it’s what we love to do. And we have the chutzpah to tell you that we do it better than anybody else out there. So we’re back, before the start of what we hope is a truly normal basketball season after two straight weird ones, to offer up our annual NBA player rankings.Exhaustively argued and astutely ordered, our readers know ranking the top 50 players in the NBA is a tradition here at Complex Sports. But before wading into this year’s version, you should know that we’ve anointed someone new as basketball’s best. Spoiler alert: the reign of LeBron James as the NBA’s unquestioned No. 1 baller has ended. While LeBron stans and Lakers fans may protest, we expect the majority of readers will not have any issues with our new No. 1. Nor will they have any issues with our top 5. Or probably the top 10. The controversies and complaints start once we get into the teens and we’re prepared to never hear the end of it for placing the forever polarizing Draymond Green on our list yet again.We think you’ll agree with how the majority of our rankings shook out, knowing, of course, that this exercise will forever be rooted in imperfect science. You’ll probably raise a few eyebrows or possibly even curse our name as you scroll through. We get it. We respect it. Just read the reasons why we moved Khris Middleton way up and left a few familiar names from previous seasons off before roasting us on Twitter, please.',\n",
       " 'Ranking The Top 20 NBA Players 2021The 2020-2021 NBA regular season has concluded and has given us the opportunity to re-rank the top 20 NBA players. Some of the criteria we will be using are skills, performances, and impact on winning. For this list, I will try to rank them as if healthy, for the most part. Previous lists usually took availability more into consideration. That may be why you will find many different rankings from my previous top NBA players list from March.Devin Booker is one of the most gifted scorers in the NBA. He started the year as the third best shooting guard on my list, and is arguably second best. I’m of the belief that Booker still has a long way to go in his development. The addition of Paul has enabled Booker to be more efficient, which was much needed. I believe Booker has “dominant” type skillset, but has yet to really be able to show that in a winning situation. In summary, teams do not fear Booker the way they should just yet.Although I was not a fan of Beal’s attitude to start the year, he eventually bought into Westbrook’s leadership and the Wizards benefited as a result of it. Beal is one of the most capable scorers in the NBA. He could be higher on this list if he made his teammates better or played defense. The Wizards have a long way to go, and so does Beal.Per Sources followers may accuse me of being biased for ranking Tatum above Beal. However, I’ll make it very simple for you to understand. The playin tournament said it all for me. Tatum is improving as an offensive threat and has earned the respect of almost every NBA defender. His ability to score is right up there with the elites. Unlike Beal and Booker, I have seen Tatum do it in meaningful games, repeatedly. In addition to that, Jayson Tatum plays defense. Defense still matters folks.Some NBA fans rank Tatum as a top 10 player. I am not there yet.Yes, I have Simmons over Tatum, for now. Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate, and the star point guard of the no.1 ranked team in the Eastern Conference.  He makes his teammates better and does a lot at an elite level.Unfortunately, his inability to shoot is what’s keeping him from climbing on this list.As many of you already know, I am not a fan of Kyrie Irving. In fact, I have expressed numerous times why I and many others dislike Kyrie Irving. However, there is no denying Irving’s skillset and impact on winning, when playing alongside other stars. He is one of the best complimentary pieces to elite talent that you can find in the NBA.When available, Irving has proven he can help a team win when playing alongside two other all-stars. Irving is showing that once again.What more can Chris Paul do to prove to us that he is still an elite point guard in the NBA? Chris Paul is one of the best regular season players in NBA history. He makes any team he joins better. My only knock on Paul remains the fact that I have not seen him impact winning when his teams need him most. I don’t expect this year to be any different.For what he does, he does really well. He is still very impressive at 36 years of age.There are very few players that impact winning and make their teammates better the way Jimmy Butler does. The Heat were one of the best passing teams in the NBA this season, and would have finished with a better record had Butler not missed time. Butler is one of the toughest two way players in the NBA.I have my suspicions as to why the Heat struggled in the playoffs this year. Butler is not to blame for that, in my opinion.There are very few players who can actually impact the culture of an organization. The Wizards have almost become too content with missing the playoffs. They even started this season with wanting to give up at several points. Nonetheless, Westbrook never gave up.Westbrook was willing to do it all to lift the Wizards to the 8th seed. By any means necessary, the Wizards made it, despite having a mediocre and relatively injured roster. Westbrook is truly one of the most underappreciated superstars in NBA history.George remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. Say what you want about his lack of playoff success, there is no denying George’s talent and physical gifts. My only issue with George is his mental toughness. He reminds me a lot of Vince Carter.In my heart, I still believe that Leonard is the second best player in the NBA. I just couldn’t rank him in my top 10 NBA players at this point. All the things I respected about Leonard haven’t been present ever since he joined the Clippers. In the past, I watched LeBron James shut down the Bulls’ offense when guarding Derrick Rose in the playoffs. Last night, Leonard failed to instill any fear in the heart of Doncic and the Mavericks.Something has changed for the worse, and I can’t pin point what it is exactly. Leonard is still the closest thing I have seen to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, but I need some reconvincing right now.What Anthony Davis can do, when healthy, is almost unmatched. He remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. I know I mentioned in the opening paragraph that I would weigh availability a little less than I usually do, but I just can’t do that with Davis. He may be the reason the Lakers are about to be eliminated tonight. Davis needs to figure out a way to be available. Despite his health issues, I couldn’t leave a talent like Davis off the top 10 of my top 20 NBA players in 2021.I’m of the belief that Lillard is asked to do too much, which causes him to burn out come playoff time. That is why I lack faith in Lillard and the Trail Blazers come playoff time. However, there is no denying that Lillard is a superstar talent. Not only is he an elite scoring point guard, he is arguably the most clutch player in the NBA. When I think of Lillard, I don’t think of dominant like Leonard. However, the continuity he has with Terry Stotts has enabled Lillard to perform at a very high level in the regular season. The guys ahead of Lillard on my top 20 NBA players 2021 list, I consider dominant.Joel Embiid is right up there with Anthony Davis as one of the best two way big men in the NBA. Embiid’s dominance enabled him to be an MVP favorite for a large chunk of the season. However, like Davis, injuries have plagued him throughout his career. If the 76ers are going to win an NBA championship this season, they’re going to need a healthy Embiid to be at his best.Embiid has the talent to do it. The question is, is he built to last?MVP.Ranking Doncic ahead of Jokic on my top 10 NBA players list was a very difficult decision for me. They both make their teams better, dominate at a high level, and have incredibly high basketball IQs. Jokic is a slightly better defender.  However, it is very easy to argue that Doncic is doing a lot more, with a lot less talent. Doncic used the early portion of the regular season to get himself in shape, which cost the Mavericks in the rankings. Now that he is in shape, he is almost impossible to stop. I watched Doncic single handedly torch the Los Angeles Clippers last night.Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tim Dunca, LeBron James, and now Luka Doncic. I consider this kid a once in a generation type talent. I haven’t been wrong about Doncic yet. If I’m wrong right now, it may be the fact that I’m not ranking him as the best player in the world yet.For a decent amount of this season, Harden was playing like the best player in basketball. Now that he is healthy again, he is looking like the best player in the world once again. Sometimes opportunity can shape up a large part of your success. Harden may be a beneficiary of his current opportunity with the loaded Brooklyn Nets.Harden also happens to be the most lethal isolation offensive threat I’ve ever seen in my life. Whether it’s the step back three, attacking the rim, or passing, Harden can do it all. I just wonder what he and the Nets will look like playing against another top tier eastern conference team. There is no denying the 2x MVP & DPOY’s talent. Perhaps no player impacts both sides of the court like Antetokounmpo does. I also love the fact that he is continuing to improve, year after year. Antetokounmpo’s poise may help the Bucks win in this post season. Fans may argue his limitations as a shooter. I believe this series vs the Brooklyn Nets will be a massive indicator as to just how much does shooting matter to a star in the NBA.LeBron James publicly considered Curry as the MVP for good reason. Curry proved once again that he can torch any team, on any given night. He is the best shooter in NBA history. His handles are on par with Irving and his passing is on par with Nash. He is one of the most gifted point guards in NBA history, currently ranked 2nd all time on my list.If Klay was healthy, the Warriors would be my favorites to win the NBA championship this season. Ranking Durant this highly is complicated and slightly contradictory. If I was building a team for the regular season, I can argue that there are 20+ players I’d take over Kevin Durant. If it weren’t for a mid season trade, I don’t know if Brooklyn would have even made the playoffs this season due to his and Irving’s absences. However, I’m looking at Durant as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Durant is one of the most gifted, if not the most gifted, scorer in NBA history. There is no proven method of guarding Durant. I don’t know if there is a proven way of even slowing him down. When available, good luck finding a scorer better than Durant. As of right now, he is available, and dominant.LeBron James is still the king in my eyes. He makes his teammates better in ways no one else can in the NBA. I don’t think people realize how bad the Lakers roster actually is. They have taken a significant step back from last season’s team, and I didn’t even think that roster was that good.At 36, the king remains dominant. However, for the first time in Per Sources history, I feel like the end of James’ dominance is near. It’s shaky. I can sense it.  I hope when the time comes, I’m ready to admit it.I have to mention Klay Thompson, who is out due to injury. Two players I feel the need to mention are Rudy Gobert and Trae Young. Both have impact on winning that I do not feel like NBA fans appreciate. I’d also like to recognize the improving talents of DeAndre Ayton, Ja Morant, and Zion Williamson.Jaylen Brown and Julius Randle are also two players that could make this list next season.

       " 'Top 100 NBA players for 2021-22 seasonJoel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Sixers, top 100 NBA players (Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)We are less than two weeks from the beginning of training camp. NBA basketball is on the horizon, and with it comes the return of the greatest basketball players in the world.Before last season, we ranked the top 50 NBA players. It’s safe to say a lot has changed since then. This time around, we are expanding the list to 100 in an effort to show more love to more excellent players.For comparison’s sake, here are the top 10 players from last preseason:Given the relative uncertainty around rookies, we did not put rookies on the list. Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and the like will probably join the top 100 soon enough, but we haven’t seen them in NBA action yet.Here are the top 100 NBA players entering the 2021-22 season.Andrew Wiggins made the best of his new situation in Golden State, becoming a genuinely impressive wing defender and a useful complementary scorer. He’s still prone to some brutal decision-making on offense, but if he can keep hitting 38.0 percent of his 3s, Golden State will be more than happy.The Warriors will be right back in contention next season if Klay Thompson is healthy. Golden State has loaded up on a couple strong free agents, and with Kelly Oubre presumably out of the way, Wiggins should have more room to play to his strengths as a downhill driver and cutter.Larry Nance Jr. is best known for his dunks, but he’s more than a vertical spectacle. He’s one of the best defensive forwards in the NBA, supplying elite versatility to any rotation. His quick hands, dynamic athleticism, and advanced instincts allow him to guard multiple positions, and he’s a force off the ball, where he racks up deflections.On offense, Nance has rounded into form as a strong complementary talent. He processes the game at a high level, and generally knows where and when he should be. He doesn’t domineer possessions, but instead thrives as a rim runner and occasional spot-up shooter, with the passing chops necessary to connect all the dots.The Pelicans will benefit from Devonte’ Graham’s arrival, even if it stems from unfortunate asset mismanagement. He’s a pretty perfect fit next to Zion Williamson — a high-I.Q. playmaker and one of the NBA’s most prolific spot-up shooters. He can play off the ball, or keep the offense zipping when he’s at the controls.Graham struggled at times last season, but he was also buried in a deep Charlotte backcourt. For better or worse, the Pelicans will put his talent on full display. He’s essentially the No. 3 option behind Williamson and Brandon Ingram at this point.Steven Adams is universally accepted as the strongest player in the NBA. That has its inherent benefits. He’s possibly the best offensive rebounder in the game, not to mention a pretty darn great defensive rebounder. He can also impose his will defensively in certain matchups, especially when harassing the league’s more post-bound centers.A rough year in New Orleans has dulled the excitement around Adams as a player, but he’s still quite useful, and should find a more amiable home in Memphis. He can feast on dump-offs from Ja Morant and bring his physicality to the city of Grit n’ Grind.Kelly Olynyk experienced a renaissance of sorts in Houston, seeing his workload expanded tenfold for a losing team short on NBA talent. While Olynyk’s numbers in Houston probably overstate his value — 19.0 points, 8.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, .542/.392/.844 — he is no doubt a very useful, versatile offensive weapon.We should see Olynyk produce fruitfully in Detroit, even if he will now take a backseat to Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant. He brings immense value as a floor-spacer at center, with the quickness and face-up ability to torch slower bigs on the perimeter. He’s also a physical, smart team defender, if not a great rim protector.Build your custom\\xa0FanSided Daily email newsletter with news and analysis on\\xa0Philadelphia 76ers and all your favorite sports teams, TV shows, and more.Your favorite teams, topics, and players all on your favorite mobile devices.© 2022 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

       " \"Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2020-21 season?\\nA new season means new player rankings.As always, this is a collaborative effort,\\xa0with eight\\xa0members of our NBA.com Global Staff submitting their list of who they believe are\\xa0the 30-best players heading into the 2020-21 season. We then used a point system to come up with the following list.The last time we did this was after the Los Angeles Lakers were crowned champions of the 2019-20 season. Not much has changed since then thanks to a shorter-than-normal offseason, but that doesn't mean our ranking isn't\\xa0different, because\\xa0we've\\xa0included\\xa0Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving this time, three top-30 players\\xa0who\\xa0didn't crack our last list due to season-ending injuries.The only notable player not included this time: Klay Thompson, who is expected to miss the entire 2020-21 season with a torn Achilles.With all that in mind, onto the list. \\nComing up with a top-30 is harder than you'd think.Here are some notable players who just missed the cut:Of those players, Westbrook, Middleton, Ingram, Porzingis, Fox and Russell were the only ones to receive votes from our NBA.com Staff heading into 2020-21.Additionally, Middleton, Westbrook and\\xa0McCollum made our last top-30 list. Middleton ranked 21st, Westbrook ranked 22nd and McCollum ranked 28th. \\nHighest rank: 8Lowest rank:\\xa010Lillard put the NBA on notice in the season restart, carrying the Blazers to the playoffs with averages of 37.6 points and 9.6 assists on .497/.436/.888 shooting splits over their eight\\xa0seeding games, earning him Bubble MVP.With a better supporting cast this season, Lillard could work his way into the MVP discussion if the Blazers sneak their way into the top four of the Western Conference this season. \\nHighest rank:\\xa07Lowest rank:\\xa010Arguably the best offensive player in the NBA, Harden has led the league\\xa0in scoring in three consecutive seasons, peaking in 2018-19 with 36.1 points per game. Say what you want about his postseason history, but the Rockets have made the playoffs eight straight seasons with Harden at the helm, giving them the longest active streak in the NBA. \\nHighest rank:\\xa07Lowest rank: 10The way Jokic ended last season sure made everyone forget how he started it. He took his game to another level in the playoffs yet again, leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals with 24.4 points, 9.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game.Is there any question as to who the best centre in the league is anymore? \\nHighest rank:\\xa06Lowest rank:\\xa011A six-time All-Star, three-time champion, two-time MVP and one-time scoring champion ...\\xa0Curry's resume speaks for itself. The question with him is health. After missing all but five games last season with a broken hand, Golden State's hope of returning to the playoffs this season in a crowded Western Conference hinges on Curry staying on the court. \\nHighest rank:\\xa06Lowest rank:\\xa011In his sophomore season, Doncic posted 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. According to Stathead, only two players in NBA history have ever posted those numbers before.Those players? Russell Westbrook and Oscar Robertson.Doncic followed that up by breaking a number of records in his first taste of postseason basketball.Luka Doncic in his first playoff run:- 31.0 points per game- 9.8 rebounds per game- 8.7 assists per game - Most points in a playoff debut- 2 triple-doubles- 40/15/10 game (3rd ever)- 1 walk-off game winner- Youngest player with a playoff game-winnerHe's 21 years old. pic.twitter.com/tlzhZfhWeQHe's only 21, but Doncic is well on his way towards being an all-time great. \\nHighest rank:\\xa04Lowest rank:\\xa05The last time we saw Durant, he was arguably the best player in the NBA. Even if he's 90 percent of the player he was prior to tearing his Achilles, he'll likely be worthy\\xa0of this spot.You have to take everything that happens in preseason with a grain of salt, but Durant's debut with the Nets sure was promising.The comeback is on. 🎥 15 points in the preseason debut for @KDTrey5 🎥 pic.twitter.com/tPywmhuTIN \\nHighest rank:\\xa02Lowest rank:\\xa05Coming off of one of the greatest individual postseason runs in NBA history, we had Leonard as the best player in the league heading into the 2019-20 season.\\xa0He put together a career year with the Clippers in averaging 27.1 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.9 rebounds per game, but it all came crumbling down in the playoffs, blowing a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets in the second round.That might've cost\\xa0Leonard a few spots on this list, but he's still arguably the best two-way player\\xa0in the league. \\nHighest rank:\\xa02Lowest rank:\\xa04Davis\\xa0didn't disappoint in his first playoff run with the Lakers. The biggest surprise? His jump shot. After making 34.9 percent of his field goal attempts from midrange during the regular season, Davis\\xa0shot 49.6 percent\\xa0from that distance in the playoffs. Davis also improved his 3-point percentage, from 33.0 percent in the regular season to 38.3 percent in the playoffs.\\xa0If that's a sign of what's to come ... uh oh. \\nHighest rank:\\xa01Lowest rank:\\xa03Not only did Antetokounmpo win his second MVP award last season, he became the third player in NBA history to\\xa0be named the league's MVP and DPOY in the same season, joining two legends in Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.Regular season Giannis is arguably the best player in the league, but it's hard to see him taking the top spot until he has more success in the playoffs.\\xa0 \\nHighest rank: 1Lowest rank: 4Who else were you expecting?We didn't have James as the No. 1 player in the league entering the 2019-20 season, but he proved us and everyone else who doubted him in any way, shape or form wrong last season in leading the Lakers to the championship with averages of 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game in the Finals.James enters his age 36 season ranked ninth all-time in regular season minutes and first all-time in postseason minutes. Father Time should've caught up to him at this point, but he hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.* Not ranked due to injuries.The views on this page do not necessarily represent the views of the NBA or its clubs.\",\n",

       " \"Top 100 NBA Players of 2019The Crossover is proud to offer our list of the Top 100 NBA players of 2019, an exhaustive exercise that seeks to define who will be the league's best players in the 2018-19 season.Given the wide variety of candidates involved and the deep analytical resources available, no single, definitive criterion was used to form this list. Instead, rankings were assigned based on a fluid combination of subjective assessment and objective data. This list is an attempt to evaluate each player in a vacuum, independent of his current team context as much as possible. A player's prospects beyond the 2018-19 season did not play a part in the ranking process.Injuries and injury risks are an inevitable component of this judgment. Past performance (postseason included) weighed heavily in our assessment, with a skew toward the recent. First-year players were not included. A predictive element also came into play with the anticipated improvement of certain younger players, as well as the possible decline of aging veterans. Salary was not taken into consideration. Otherwise, players were ordered based on their complete games. You can read more here on the limitations of this kind of ranking. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year, click here.Please feel free to look back to SI.com’s Top 100 Players of 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. A special thanks, as always, to those resources that make researching a list like this possible: Basketball-Reference, NBA.com, ESPN.com, Cleaning the Glass, and Synergy Sports.Ball (10.2 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 7.2 APG) was the league’s easiest target last season: He faced significant pressure as the No. 2 pick, he faced extra scrutiny on a high-profile franchise that had one eye on LeBron James, he faced derision for his unsightly jumper and fading confidence, and he faced second-hand disdain thanks to the ramblings of his infamous father and his immature brother. “Baptism by Fire” would be an appropriate name for a documentary about his first season, which began with Patrick Beverley eating him for dinner and ended with knee problems that ultimately required summer surgery.At his best, the 20-year-old Ball plays a beautiful weirdo brand of hoops that would merit a full chapter if “Free Darko” ever released a sequel. His passing and vision—hailed as elite by pre-draft analysts—lived up to the hype. He proved to be a capable pace-setter and a strong rebounder for his position. Most impressively, he was a plus defender right out of the gate thanks to his good size and instincts. On paper, Ball’s role in James’s new cast is intriguing. A successful blueprint would utilize him as a secondary passer and off-ball cutter, rather than as a full-time lead guard launching misguided threes in volume. Although Ball is hardly a textbook modern backcourt prospect, the dawn of “LeBronzo” promises to carry his distinctive game to new heights. — BGJust because the Lakers had no use for Lopez (13.0 PPG, 4.0 RPG) doesn’t mean the same is true for other teams. It’s not hard to find room for a seven-footer who can score inside and out, and most important: one who doesn’t need much preamble to set up his scoring opportunities. Posting up Lopez is an option, but far from the only one. You could set him up for rolls to the rim or rely on his cuts to complement other offense. Or, if you prefer, you can station him outside to open up the lane. Lopez isn’t a lights-out three-point shooter, though last season he converted the same percentage of his threes (34.5%) as Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, and Blake Griffin—all bigs with some light stretch to their games.All told, Lopez still scored 20 points per 36 minutes for a team that had no incentive to play him or rely on him in any way. That will be different in Milwaukee, as it would be on any number of teams looking to actually win games this season. Lopez’s defense is clearly imperfect, though he at least has the benefit of sheer size; it’s hard to clear the ball over a center with that kind of reach, even if he runs into trouble defending in space. — RMAge may have restricted how and when Gasol can be of help, but coaches tend to find a place for those who understand the symphony of the game. Gasol (10.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 3.1 APG) is more than the collection of his skills and liabilities; his enduring value comes in knowing what opportunities might materialize, and having the presence of mind to assist in their creation. Any offense that moves would benefit from dropping Gasol in the middle of it all, where he presents a scoring threat even as he connects the dots for his teammates.The cost comes in mobility—both in a literal sense and a tactical one. On his best days, the 38-year-old Gasol navigates the floor at a brisk shuffle. Switching isn’t an option. Longer rotations can be a challenge. San Antonio managed a top-five defense in spite of this, but Gasol would present much greater problems for many lesser teams. His, like many in this range, is a borderline case. What value Gasol still has depends on how effectively a team manages the narrowing limits of his game. — RMStan Van Gundy bet the house on Jackson (14.6 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 5.3 APG) and lost. In 2015, the longtime coach targeted the stubborn, capable point guard as the centerpiece of a win-now spending spree aimed at fast-tracking the Pistons back to the postseason. The plan worked momentarily, as Jackson turned in a career year en route to the 2016 playoffs. But Jackson’s spotty health plunged Detroit back into the lottery in 2017 and 2018, and Van Gundy was fired in May. The final stats on the Jackson/Van Gundy marriage: $80 million, one playoff trip, zero playoff wins, two season-altering injuries, numerous post-game rants, and one desperate Blake Griffin trade that will likely clog Detroit’s books for years to come.While Jackson, 28, is a bit of a forgotten man at this point, it’s worth noting that Detroit played at a 49-win place last season with him in the lineup. To piece his reputation back together, Jackson will need to prove that he can still get to the rim consistently, shoot the three far better than he did in 2017-18, and stay healthy for a full season. With Griffin and Andre Drummond now capable of handling some of the playmaking load, Detroit can make the playoffs without Jackson turning back the clock to his 2016 form. Expecting Jackson to be a franchise point guard was always asking too much, but he has enough talent and experience to be recast effectively in a smaller role if he’s willing. — BGTo understand how Nowitzki clings to this list past his 40th birthday, one need only watch how defenses regard him. Every screen he sets has an adhesive effect; those defenders involved know that their first priority is to slow the progress of the ball handler, but to do so requires that they reluctantly peel away from Nowitzki (12.0 PPG, 5.7 RPG). There is more than reputation at work. Just last season, Nowitzki rated as one of the better spot-up shooters in the league, per Synergy Sports—more efficient, shot for shot, than even Klay Thompson and J.J. Redick. Opponents won’t dare leave Dirk because they know just how punishing his open looks can be.Nearly everything else in Nowitzki’s game has faded with time. One can practically hear his creaking joints when he tries to back down some younger, springier center, and there is no disguising his slow-motion coverage of the pick-and-roll. It speaks volumes, however, that a walking—err, lumbering?—target like Nowitzki still works out to be a helpful contributor in so many lineups. There is something to be said for standard bearing and institutional knowledge, but even more when those things come from a low-turnover, sweet-shooting big who is more than willing to accept a lesser role. Dirk’s value to an organization has aged more gracefully than his footspeed. — RMLet’s credit Carroll (13.5 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 2.0 APG) with genuine nobility. Remember, it wasn’t so long ago that the 32-year-old forward was leaving Toronto as a huge disappointment due to an exorbitant four-year, $60 million contract, a debilitating knee injury and a pair of meek postseasons. After he was salary-dumped to the dead-end Nets, Carroll could have counted his money and jogged through a losing campaign. Instead, he responded to the trying circumstances with purposeful 3-and-D play. In addition to posting career-highs in points, rebounds and assists, Carroll regained his footing on the defensive end, ranking No. 64 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus.With better health, Carroll has largely returned to the form he displayed for the 2015 Hawks. On offense, he subsists on catch-and-shoot threes and cuts to the basket. On defense, he rotates through multiple perimeter positions and rates well on hustle stats like deflections and recovered loose balls thanks to his high-activity style. If Carroll can keep things rolling to open 2018-19, he should generate healthy interest from playoff teams at the trade deadline or during buyout season. — BGIt’s no exaggeration to say that VanVleet (8.6 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 3.2 APG) was an impact stats god last year. The 24-year-old Raptors guard, who finished third in 2018 Sixth Man of the Year voting, was off the charts in virtually every lineup configuration. When he played with his fellow young reserves, who led the NBA among bench groups in net rating, Toronto was +17.1. When he joined a veteran-heavy and starters-dominated group as a floor-spacing third guard, Toronto was +24.9. Remarkably, VanVleet ranked No. 28 in the NBA in Real Plus-Minus and in the top 100 by both Win Shares and WARP. All this for an undersized, undrafted player who has yet to record a single start in two seasons.The magnitude of VanVleet’s success in a limited role naturally raises some questions. How well would his contributions hold up if he was forced to play more than 20 minutes a night? How would he fare if he was asked to lead a less-talented bench group? How well would his game translate to the playoffs? The early returns on that last question were not pretty. As he worked back from an untimely shoulder injury, VanVleet couldn’t recapture his dependable three-point stroke and wasn’t about to single-handedly solve Toronto’s annual problems with composure and defense. The Raptors’ ugly ending poured some cold water on their much-hyped bench play, but it didn’t erase VanVleet’s substantial progress. The sweep against Cleveland didn’t kill VanVleet’s earning power either, as he cashed in with a well-deserved two-year, $18 million contract in July. — BGOlynyk shoots just well enough from the perimeter to earn a close-out, which is exactly the point. The shot itself is a setup; helpful as it is that Olynyk can take and make threes, his funky, off-kilter drives are the true underpinning of his game.Each of his forays into traffic is an improbable enterprise. Olynyk (11.5 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.7 APG) is about as far from the driving prototype as NBA players come; he isn’t especially quick, or explosive, or creative with the ball. His running form most closely resembles that of a giraffe. Yet when given room to navigate, Olynyk has a knack for sliding between defenders, coursing into the paint for layups of all kinds. Miami played its best basketball last season with Olynyk on the floor, in large part because those ball skills matter. When a big can create space and capitalize when called upon, they allow more possessions to follow through to their natural conclusion. — RMThinking for too long about Fournier (17.8 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 2.9 APG) in Orlando can lead to intense feelings of sympathy and hopelessness. The 25-year-old guard is a proven shooter and cheeky ball-handler who is stuck in a constant struggle to score enough points to offset his porous defense, all while playing for an organization that doesn’t offer much in the way of supporting talent or structure. His 2017-18 campaign marked a career year in scoring and efficiency, but it ended prematurely due to injury and didn’t improve the Magic’s playoff prospects in the slightest. If a relatively anonymous Frenchman goes for 22 in a loss in front of a listless crowd, does he make a sound?Although Fournier appears to be a lost cause on defense due to his lack of physicality and questionable will, he’s filled out his offensive repertoire nicely. After four years with the Magic, he’s a trustworthy catch-and-shoot option from the wing, he understands how to relocate into space to find a quality look, he’s shifty coming around screens and splitting defenders, and he’s developed some off-legged floaters and runners to catch bigs by surprise. Although his sizeable contract makes it difficult to construct viable trade scenarios, it’s easy to envision him thriving in an Eric Gordon-like role for a playoff team that needs instant offense off the bench. As is, the Magic are asking too much of him offensively and he’s not asking enough from himself defensively. — BGBazemore (12.9 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.5 APG) is the NBA’s anti-Forrest Gump: He has an uncanny knack for always just missing out on the action. The 29-year-old guard, who went undrafted in 2012, arrived on the scene with the Warriors just before Stephen Curry and Co. rocketed to dynasty mode. He then had a brief cup of coffee with the Lakers in 2014, a period of deep irrelevance after the ill-fated Dwight Howard experiment but before Kobe Bryant’s farewell tour. From there he landed in Atlanta, where he played a bit role on a team that made the 2015 East finals before finally breaking out in a starting role just as the team’s core was disbanded.Thanks to the four-year, $70 million contract he inked during the 2016 cap spike, Bazemore has gone from toiling in the G-League to becoming the highest-paid player on one of the league’s worst rosters in less than five years. Although he’s clearly overpaid and unequipped to be a playoff team’s best, second-best or third-best player, Bazemore is a solid 3-and-D wing with good size and motor. In an ideal world, he would be cast as a fifth option in a contender’s starting lineup and asked to space the court, pick his spots to attack off the dribble, and bring energy on the defensive end. If Trae Young grows quickly into stardom, Bazemore will be a handy complementary piece. If not, he’ll continue to be grist for the trade rumor mill. — BGThe closest Orlando came to competence last season was in Vucevic’s time on the floor. So continued a four-year run of inflated usage, in which the seven-footer was overstretched and miscast as a primary offensive option. No playoff team would use Vucevic (16.5 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 3.4 APG) in this way, but the Magic—even after five straight years in the lottery—are short on viable alternatives. Vucevic’s steady, accessible scoring is welcome on a team with so many stalled possessions.Extricating Vucevic’s broader value from those circumstances is challenging, though one can safely assume he would be better served by doing less. Just because Vucevic can score a bit from everywhere (including beyond the arc, in a recent development) doesn’t mean he should try to quite so often; for Vucevic to attempt about as many shots per minute as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis Antetokounmpo is a monumental stretch. Were he on a remotely functional team with amenities like floor spacing and playmaking, Vucevic could slot into a healthier role as a supporting scorer and dependable rebounder. — RMMurray (8.1 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.9 APG) is the NBA equivalent of a writing whiz who aces the verbal section of the SAT with ease but gives up and guesses “C” on all the math questions. By virtually every defensive metric, the second-year guard is phenomenal. At 21, he earned All-Defensive Second Team honors by placing in the top 10 in Defensive Real Plus-Minus, Defensive Rating, and steal percentage while playing for the NBA’s fourth-ranked defense. Murray is a prototypical backcourt stopper in both physique and psychology: long, quick, aware, irritating, diligent, and fully committed to the glass.By virtually every offensive metric, though, Murray is a borderline mess. He’s been an incompetent and unwilling shooter at the NBA level, and he is regularly neglected and dared to shoot. Unlike many guards who struggle from beyond the arc, he hasn’t yet perfected a compensatory weapon like a step-in mid-range jumper or an in-between floater. While Murray is generally unselfish and a willing passer, he’s not adept enough in the two-man game to function as a lead distributor. In sum, the Spurs’ offense was generally better when the ball was in someone else’s hands. With Kawhi Leonard, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Kyle Anderson all departing this summer, the man dubbed “Baby Boy” as a Seattle-area prep star must grow up in a hurry. — BG“Slo Mo” might not be the best nickname in pro sports, but it’s certainly the most accurate. Anderson (7.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 2.7 APG) is deliberate in virtually everything he does, whether it’s pushing the ball in transition, executing a frame-by-frame Eurostep, or acclimating to life in the NBA. Although it took four seasons and Kawhi Leonard’s extended absence for Anderson to break through as a full-time starter, he acquitted himself very nicely once he got there. The 24-year-old forward posted career-highs across the board last season, and his efficient play and all-around contributions landed him in the top 75 by Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP. Seeking a value play to make up for the Chandler Parsons debacle, Memphis poached Anderson with a four-year, $37 million contract in July.Anderson’s biggest weakness—poor outside shooting—is a critical one, but he has developed workarounds: He has a strong understanding of team spacing, he stays active off the ball, he moves hard into passes to launch unexpected attacks on the paint, he sprays drive-and-kick passes to all corners and he has a quirky and well-honed array of turnarounds, floaters and runners. San Antonio’s recent actions suggest, however, that they perceived a hard ceiling to his utility given his floor-cramping nature and limited raw athleticism. The Spurs sharply cut his minutes when facing the Warriors in the playoffs, and then decided not to match the Grizzlies’ offer even though they had a major hole on the wing. For Anderson, Memphis represents a fresh start, a larger role, and a chance to prove that his subtle and nuanced style can translate outside San Antonio’s structured environment. — BGSteve Kerr delivered a fitting postscript to Golden State’s grueling seven-game triumph over Houston in the West finals: “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.” That assessment spoke to the importance of the Warriors’ prized sixth man, but also to the precarious position the defending champs face when he’s not on the court. Indeed, the 34-year-old Iguodala (6 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.3 APG) has arguably become the biggest potential pothole on the road to a fourth title in five years. Last season, he continued to show clear signs of aging by posting career-lows in minutes and points, missing 18 regular-season games and six crucial playoff games, and failing to display must trust in his three-point shot.Nevertheless, the Warriors remain virtually unbeatable when their full “Hamptons 5” lineup is assembled, going 19-3 combined in the last two postseasons. During the 2018 playoffs, they posted a 123.7 offensive rating and a staggering +24.8 net rating, as Iguodala’s excellent feel, commitment to the pass, precise defense, and opportunistic shot-making continued to make him an ideal fifth option. While there’s no question that Iguodala’s reputation and body would suffer if he played for a weaker team, aspiring contenders like Houston, Boston and Philadelphia would all kill to have a second-unit wing with his intelligence, experience and unselfish approach. — BGFor a player as active as Johnson (10.8 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 3.8 APG), a sports hernia—the injury he nursed through much of last season—can prove quite taxing. So much of Johnson’s game is anchored in how he moves; it’s his ability to change speeds and directions that makes him so dynamic on offense, and it’s the ease with which he slides laterally that brings value to a defense. If Johnson’s all-around play seemed a bit flat last season, that’s because it was—down to his every step.Offseason surgery hints at a return to form. Competing in the modern NBA all but demands a player like Johnson—a big who can capably switch, handle, pass, and shoot. Some of those skills are less reliable than others in Johnson’s case, though their intersection alone makes him valuable. You live with his wilder swings because of all that his versatility unlocks. The means to beat the trap, to trigger the break, to control matchups, and to move a guard off the ball are all there for Johnson, provided he’s healthy and focused. — RMFormer Rockets wing Shane Battier was famously dubbed the “No-Stats All-Star” for his vital defense and glue-guy game; Tucker (6.1 PPG, 5.6 RPG) is his pudgier heir apparent in Houston. By traditional individual measures, the 33-year-old forward was an afterthought, ranking outside the NBA’s top 300 in PER while placing seventh on the Rockets in points and sixth in touches. But the impact stats told a much different story: Tucker improved the Rockets’ efficiency on offense and defense during the regular season and the playoffs, he boasted a stellar +10.8 net rating, and he ranked No. 87 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus. By February, he had forced his way into the starting lineup, holding that spot throughout the Rockets’ run to the West finals. Not bad for roughly $8 million per year.Tucker, like Battier before him, has carved his niche through pure feistiness. Although he is listed at just 6’6”, he was regularly deployed as a center when coach Mike D’Antoni sought to maximize his lineup’s spacing and switchability. To compensate for his lack of length and shot-blocking ability, Tucker consistently forced opponents to work hard for post position, contested rebounds with abandon, and delivered hard fouls as needed. True to his tough-minded reputation, the former second-round pick also led the Rockets in drawn charges and recovered loose balls. While Tucker might never claim glory like James Harden and Chris Paul, he surely possesses his superstar teammates’ gratitude. — BGAs Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum bucked the norm by playing leading roles on teams that advanced in the playoffs, Markkanen (15.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG) lived a more conventional experience for a lottery pick. The 21-year-old Finnish forward endured months of losing and tanking with the Bulls, he struggled to adjust to his defensive responsibilities, and he missed 14 games due, in part, to minor back injuries. Despite those hurdles, Markkanen was an easy All-Rookie First Team selection because he proved to be a legit marksman with a quick, natural release and range that extended multiple steps beyond the arc. Indeed, the 7-footer drilled 145 threes last season, the most in NBA history by a rookie taller than 6’9”.As the season progressed, his signature pick-and-pop game was supplemented by fake-and-drive action that allowed him to use his length to finish in one-on-one scenarios. While not yet much of a playmaker, Markkanen can handle well enough to locate pull-up shots or get going downhill. On the defensive end, he switched and hit the boards better than expected, but he still ranked outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus due to strength limitations and awareness issues. Markkanen is reportedly adding weight in anticipation of playing more center, a tough ask given that he had the lowest block rate among 7-footers who logged at least 2,000 minutes in 2017-18. The good news is that he projects as such a potent offensive weapon that he only needs to become a passable defender to emerge as the face of Chicago’s youth movement. — BGCoaches tend to lean on Gibson (12.2 PPG, 7.1 RPG) because he makes their lives easier. It’s a relief to have one player on the court who always knows what’s going on, both in the conceptual sense of what a team hopes to accomplish and within the second-to-second frenzy of an NBA game. Don’t underestimate the power of that stability. Nothing about the way Gibson plays basketball is especially modern, but there is a timeless advantage in reliable execution.Gibson has made a career of it. There is never a question of whether he’s game to compete, ready for the moment, or adequately prepared. Some matchups suit Gibson better than others, but that’s just life as a role player. You make do. Smart positional defense will at least keep Gibson in the mix, allowing the rest of his game to pop for opportunistic value. He isn’t an elite rebounder, though Gibson often comes up with the board that matters. His game might not accommodate bulk scoring, but Gibson, who just turned 33, is coming off the most productive and efficient scoring season of his career. He’s a few rungs removed from the league’s truly elite defenders, but Gibson might well come up with\\xa0the stops to save your season. — RMFew players enhanced their reputations during the 2018 playoffs as much as Rozier (11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.9 APG), who stepped in for the injured Kyrie Irving and guided the Celtics to within one game of the Finals. There were two keys driving the 24-year-old guard’s postseason success. First, a supreme self-confidence. Despite never starting in his first two seasons and being known primarily as a defensive pest, Rozier sent Milwaukee packing from the first round, nailed seven threes in Game 1 against Philadelphia to set the tone in the conference semis, and held tough when LeBron James cranked it up in the East finals. Rather than freeze on the big stage, he tormented Eric Bledsoe, carried himself like a star on the postgame podium, and donned “Scary Terry” t-shirts bearing his own likeness on off days. This was a textbook case of being ready—physically and psychologically—when called upon.The second element of Rozier’s success was easy to miss amid the swagger and hoopla: He played with exceptional control, posting a 5:1 assist-to-turnover ratio in the postseason. While Rozier suffered bouts of streakiness and famously ran cold in Game 7 against the Cavaliers, his careful stewardship throughout the playoffs was crucial to Boston’s efforts to muster enough scoring and to prevail in close games. Going forward, Rozier is an obvious trade chip: He’s equipped to become a full-time starter because he’s trustworthy with the ball, he’s improved his three-point shot, he’s tenacious on defense, and he’s gotten a good taste of the limelight. — BGAminu (9.3 PPG, 7.6 RPG) is the elastic band that holds a top-10 defense together. If you prefer a conservative defensive style—as the Blazers do—then Aminu can muck up passing lanes and slow down top-scoring forwards. If you’d rather rely on switching, he’ll float from opponent to opponent without missing a beat. At the same time, Aminu would look right at home blitzing and recovering against the pick-and-roll, where his length makes a chore of even the most basic outlet pass. One can be a specialist and still have a highly transferable skill set.Of course, not every team is equipped to score around (and at times, in spite of) a marginal threat like Aminu. Every dribble he takes tends to get him deeper into trouble; a lack of practical ball skills leaves Aminu with little recourse in the face of real defensive pressure. Average three-point shooting and offensive rebounding offer some means to contribute, though many of his best looks tend to come by design. Relative to the alternatives, Aminu’s streaky jumper is the kind of attempt a defense can stomach. — RMSchröder’s 2017-18 season was a cry for structure. The only thing standing in the way of his using possessions like a superstar was common sense—a luxury, as it turns out, reserved for teams with better alternatives than Atlanta. Absent those, Schröder did as he pleased.The results were predictably fruitless. Schröder (19.4 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 6.2 APG) put up some of the emptiest numbers in the league last season, considering how little they did for Atlanta’s bottom line. This is emblematic of larger concerns. We know Schröder can beat his man off the dribble and score, but can he bring an offense to balance? Does his passing make his teammates better? Can his length and quickness translate to real defensive benefit? The jury is still out, even within the league. It means something that Schröder is capable of producing at this level, though that “something” varies wildly depending on case and circumstance. — RMAll Sabonis needed was room to play his game. The Thunder didn’t have it; after drafting Sabonis in 2017, Oklahoma City parked him out on the perimeter and grew frustrated when he struggled. A change of scenery jump-started his career. With a trade to the Pacers came gentler expectations – the kind that allow a 22-year-old to try and to fail and to find himself. Sabonis (11.6 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 2.0 APG) was allowed to played to his strengths and develop in his own time.The entire demeanor of Sabonis’s game changed. Gone was the petrified rookie, replaced instead by an intuitive scorer and playmaker. Making decisions off the pick-and-roll and working out of the post gave Sabonis his bearings. These were spaces he knew how to navigate, full of reads he had encountered before. An easy chemistry formed between Sabonis and Victor Oladipo. The Pacers came to rely on him, so much so that Sabonis became the pressure release when Indiana’s guards ran into traps in the postseason. Sabonis isn’t perfect (concern over his lackluster defense is perfectly valid), but the feel he’s shown suggests he’s an uncommon talent. — RMOnce the most fearsome shot-blocker in the league and an ideal smallball center for postseason matchup purposes, Ibaka (12.6 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG) has skidded into an identity crisis. At the root of Ibaka’s troubles is major slippage on the defensive end: Toronto’s defensive rating was better without him last season, and his block rate was less than half of his peak levels during his early-20s. Remarkably, Jonas Valanciunas and Jakob Poeltl both defended more shots within six feet and allowed a lower percentage on those shots than did Ibaka, whose three straight All-Defensive First Team selections already seem like a distant memory.\\nThe 2018 playoffs weren’t kind to him either. When Ibaka, 28, was acquired in 2017, he was seen as the piece to help push Toronto over the top and as a rim-protecting linchpin of switchable smallball lineups that could slow down LeBron James. Instead, he largely no-showed in the embarrassing second-round sweep against Cleveland, struggling badly in Game 2 and getting benched in Game 3. At this point, Ibaka is essentially a replacement-level starter whose primary offensive value derives from his three-point shooting because his once-impressive finishing has tapered off. His career arc sadly mirrors that of his former team, the Thunder: He rose to prominence years before everyone expected and then crumbled years before everyone wanted. — BGIt’s easy to bag on Ariza considering how his season ended, but one bad shooting night doesn’t undo all that came before. Ariza (11.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG) was one of the most important players to one of the NBA’s best teams. In the Western Conference finals alone, he was Houston’s best chance of challenging Kevin Durant—a counter to Golden State’s reluctant isolations. Throughout the year, it was Ariza’s defense that gave the Rockets their elasticity. Tucker may have been the point of differentiation from big lineups to small ones, but Ariza was the constant between them.The Rockets will miss him, and Ariza them. Scoring comes easily when James Harden and Chris Paul do so much of the thinking for you. Some 82% of Ariza’s field goals—and damn near all his threes—were assisted last season. His best work comes as a beneficiary, making it difficult to assess his value in a vacuum. Houston barely needed Ariza to dribble, much less create. Most other teams—Phoenix included—would be exposed to a different level of risk. Never underestimate the superstar safety net. — RMYoung (11.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG) lives and works in the background, which seems to suit him just fine. His defense is a quiet sort—the kind predicated on denying position and making timely rotations. When Indiana’s opponents bail out midway through a set play, Young is often the unstated reason why. It’s subtle, but opportunities have a way of vanishing when Young runs interference, assuming that they materialize at all.Young is the defender who phases out Kevin Love, pushing LeBron James to the brink of a first-round elimination. The integrity of Indiana’s entire system hinges on Young’s ability to cover ground. You don’t have to switch pick-and-rolls when a player like Young can cover the gaps. His steal rate was the highest among bigs precisely because he understands how to play the space between show and recover. You won’t get much more than random, opportunistic scoring out of Young, but his court sense brings an added functionality to so many of his team’s pursuits. The Pacers may have been the best story of last season and Young, impressively, their second-best player. — RMEven though Magic Johnson scooped up virtually every available wild card in free agency, the Lakers’ biggest X-factor remains Ingram (16.1 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.9 APG). The 2016 No. 2 pick made clear strides in his second season, emerging as a full-time starter, ratcheting up his scoring and efficiency, improving as a finisher, and becoming more comfortable and less predictable with the ball in his hands. At times, Ingram brought to life the pre-draft projections that he would be a perennial All-Star wing: he displayed the handle and shake necessary to create good shots, he attacked the basket more assertively, and he deployed his spindly length to find seams through the defense and exploit size mismatches.The surest way for the new-look Lakers to make noise in the playoffs would be for Ingram to establish himself as a reliable No. 2 scoring option and a plus defender. To get there, he must continue to extend his range, engage his attack mode with greater consistency, and play more disruptively on the defensive end. He also needs better health, as he was sidelined for a quarter of L.A.’s 2017-18 season. LeBron James’s arrival, of course, should make his life easier: Ingram will face more favorable defensive matchups, receive cleaner catch-and-shoot looks, and play within a more structured and explosive style. After two seasons getting his bearings, it’s time for Ingram’s training wheels to come off for good. — BG \\xa0While Wiggins (17.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) has been guilty of playing some of the NBA’s emptiest minutes, he sure does play a lot of them. Indeed, the 2014 No. 1 overall pick has logged a league-leading 11,841 minutes and missed just one game over the last four years. Instead of using that tremendous developmental opportunity as a ramp to superstardom, the 23-year-old wing has sputtered. The major advanced stats agree that his max rookie extension and his reputation as a high-flying scorer both far exceed his on-court value, as he ranked outside the top 200 in PER and Win Shares, outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus, and outside the top 500 in WARP.As each season passes, Wiggins’s lack of follow-through becomes more aggravating. He’s attempting more threes, but he hasn’t yet established himself as a knockdown shooter. He has the body and athletic tools to be a premier defender, but his awareness lags and he’s often passive. He can sky for posters, but he shrinks on the glass. He’s been surrounded by better teammates over the last two seasons, but he hasn’t made meaningful strides as a playmaker. He appeared primed to improve his scoring efficiency as a complementary option to Jimmy Butler, but he settled into wallflower mode instead. Taken together, these burgeoning concerns beg the question: Is Wiggins, the Ironman, also a Tin Man? — BGSo often, the idea of Batum—a lanky, playmaking wing—is more appealing than the reality. You might think of Batum as a strong defender, but his investment on that end comes and goes. One night he might rise to the challenge of guarding an All-Star, and on another he might go through the motions without putting up much resistance. Batum’s shot looks nice, but he’s made just 34% of his threes over the past three years. What promise he offers as a ball-handler is undercut by the fact that he doesn’t get to the rim or draw fouls. (Batum 11.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5.5 APG) may be regarded as a scorer, but last season he barely scraped into double digits while posting an Evan Turnerian true shooting percentage (52.1%).Injury might provide more of a qualifier if not for the larger trends involved. On some level, Batum was surely less comfortable after undergoing surgery on his left elbow last October. His slide, however, extends back through multiple seasons. No one can dispute Batum’s bonafides as a facilitator, though over the last few years he’s become increasingly reliant on that area of his game—less a swiss army knife than a corkscrew. — RMAmid an unspectacular Lakers season, Randle did something notable: He tempered his game. There’s still a battering ram quality to how he plays, though every drive is more pointed than before. Young players have a hard time showing restraint without sacrificing physicality. Randle (16.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 2.6 APG) has managed to tightrope the line between them—not without the occasional misstep, but to the point of becoming an altogether more trustworthy player. Randle’s coaches and teammates no longer have to worry about him veering wildly out of control. Concern, instead, is reserved for the opponent.There’s nothing fun about standing ground against a player this strong, particularly when he has eyes for the rim. Randle can bully his way through other bigs, some traditional centers included, and has the ball skills necessary to create new angles for himself. Batten down the hatches and Randle can simply reroute. Randle will show his age at times (he defends very much like a 23-year-old), though often in ways that hint at what could be. For a third straight year, Randle ramped up his production and efficiency through less-than-ideal circumstances. What might he accomplish for a franchise more invested in his progress? — RMAn incomplete list of things that, for an NBA player, would be easier than scoring on Richardson: Moving a washer/dryer up three flights of stairs; eating a Carolina Reaper; reaching fluency in Mandarin; perfecting hummingbird pose; performing the third movement of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata”; making soufflé that doesn’t collapse; fending off a swarm of bees; beating Hollow Knight to completion; renovating a four-bedroom house by hand; and running a marathon … in crocs. His defense makes even the simplest parts of basketball into something arduous.No matter where you go on the floor or how you choose to operate, Richardson (12.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.9 APG) will be all over you, bodying up and swiping at every turn. Many defenders could manage that for minutes at a time, but what separates Richardson is his endurance. You may tire out, but he never seems to—even as his usage on offense steadily increases. It’s amazing how far Richardson’s offense has come during his three years he in the league. He started out, as many second round picks do, just trying to hit open shots and avoid making mistakes. Now he actually helps the Heat run offense. Richardson did well in his first season in a more operative role and only stands to get better. The arc of a player’s development isn’t determined by age, but by how long they’ve been working in some particular capacity. — RMOrganized basketball is a desperate grasp for control, but sometimes teams are better off leaning into the chaos. Barton (15.7 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 4.1 APG) is a conduit for it—a scorer with a bottomless capacity for surprise. Just when you think you know what Barton might do, he takes the opposite pivot, spins off in a different direction, and converts the kind of shot other players would never think to attempt. The scouting report on Barton is to throw out the scouting report.Barton’s ability—which is considerable—is exceeded by his daring. Gambits like his run the risk of backfire, but they also allow good teams to stretch beyond themselves. A little shake goes a long way. The clearest sign of Barton’s maturation is his understanding of when to let loose. His is the bargain a team can live with. There was never any question of who was better for the Nuggets last season between Barton and the safer Wilson Chandler. One fills minutes capably and predictably. The other actually makes things happen. — RMLike a July 4th cookout or a family trip to the waterpark, a change of address for Howard (16.6 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 1.6 BPG) has become a rite of summer. The eight-time All-Star center has landed in Washington via Charlotte and Brooklyn, continuing a cycle of new GMs dumping him as quickly as possible and desperate GMs talking themselves into a gamble that will almost certainly backfire.The 32-year-old Howard is far removed from his prime years and probably leads the league in worn-out welcomes, but his reputation shouldn’t completely eclipse his performance. Last season, he missed just one game, he made Charlotte better both offensively and defensively when he was on the court, and he was one of only five NBA players to average 12 points and 12 rebounds. While Howard’s defensive impact, mobility and effort have atrophied—thereby limiting his utility in the postseason—he still ranked among the league’s most productive rebounders and finished 70% of his shots in the basket area. It’s too late for the former No. 1 pick to become the player and teammate everyone has hoped for, but he remains a worthy option as a starting center. — BGCousins (25.2 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 1.6 BPG) should be regarded as the NBA’s biggest “What if” of 2018. If the two-time All-NBA center hadn’t blown his Achilles, do the Pelicans still take off down the stretch? Or, do their Twin Towers push the Warriors even harder in the playoffs? Come summertime, does he re-sign in New Orleans on a max deal? Or wind up as the superstar sidekick that LeBron James never found in LA? Or take DeAndre Jordan’s place with the Mavericks? Or become the new face of the Bulls? Remarkably, the actual fallout from Cousins’s injury trumped all those alternate histories: He signed a one-year bargain deal with Golden State, becoming the fifth All-Star in the champs’ projected starting lineup and inciting angry responses from 29 competing fan bases.Stepping back from the injury-induced whirlwind, it’s worth noting that Cousins’s year-plus stint in New Orleans didn’t provide definitive answers to the major questions that dogged him in Sacramento. Nine seasons in, he still hasn’t played in a playoff game. His raw stats—on par with prime Shaquille O’Neal—haven’t translated to elite team performance. And, at 28, he is still plagued by emotional outbursts and ejections. Nevertheless, Cousins was correct when he called his summer signing a “chess move,” as the Warriors can slow-play his rehabilitation, lighten his load, and afford to hold him to a higher personal standard.If healthy, Cousins would have placed in the top 25, but SI’s Top 100 is a one-year exercise, and this ranking assumes Cousins will miss roughly half the season, play reduced minutes upon his return, and perform at roughly 60% of his capabilities due to his age and the serious nature of his injury. — BGIndiana is still waiting on Turner. To date, the 22-year-old has been a tantalizing but only moderately effective NBA player. The shooting he brings to a lineup is nice, though Turner (12.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG) has yet to graduate from pick-and-pop specialty. He has the presence to protect the rim, if not the expertise to guarantee it; too often he’s positioned a half-step removed from where he should be or stuck a half-second behind the action, as is so common for bigs of his age and experience level. So many of the necessary skills are there. Any delay, then, comes from learning how to best apply them.This ranking is a balance. Turner has the profile of a player who could take a big step this season but still faces a burden of proof in pulling it all together. Development is rarely linear. There will be fits and starts, breakthroughs and frustrations. Maybe last season could have gone differently for Turner if he weren’t dealing with an elbow injury or gradually recovering from a concussion. All we know for certain is what we saw: another decent season with some marginal improvement and all the hallmarks of a player still finding his place in the league. — RMWhy wait until he retires? The NBA should invite Gordon (17.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 2.3 APG) to speak at the annual rookie symposium right now, as the 2014 lottery pick can already attest to the good, the bad and the ugly of professional basketball. Gordon, 22, is about to play for his fifth coach in five seasons. He’s endured four seasons with 35 or fewer wins and multiple core-altering trades. He’s deployed a hoverboard and a drone in a pair of memorable Slam Dunk Contest appearances. He’s been played out of position and seen his name listed in possible trade scenarios in a leaked photo of his front office’s whiteboard. And Rob Hennigan, the GM who drafted Gordon, spent years on the hot seat before he was finally fired.Aside from his evident explosiveness, defensive versatility and good-natured disposition, Gordon still presents more questions than answers. He’s best suited to playing the four and has ramped up his perimeter shooting, but he’s not yet consistent enough to be a true stretch option. He has the agility and motor to be a plus defender, but he’s not a traditional rim-protecting presence and is better suited to life outside the paint. Most of all, he’s emerged as a higher-volume scorer, but he’s done so with below-par efficiency on a team that hasn’t played meaningful games after Thanksgiving. On the bright side, Gordon has a new four-year, $80 million contract to show for his hard knocks, a pact that will keep analysts guessing about his value until Orlando finally finds a path back to relevance. — BG\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Harris (18.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 2.4 APG) has played for four teams in seven seasons, but he’s developed into far more than a journeyman as he’s entered his prime. In fact, the combo forward’s inclusion in a midseason trade for Blake Griffin provided an excellent opportunity to appreciate his potent and flexible offensive game. While Griffin is more imposing, more decorated and far more famous, Harris plugged seamlessly into the Clippers’ starting lineup at less than half of Griffin’s price. L.A. went 17-15 after the trade, as Harris displayed improved perimeter shooting and the ability to score without hijacking the offense.Like many stretch fours, the 26-year-old Harris often finds himself in mismatches defensively, as he lacks length and lateral quickness. He’s made some progress in terms of awareness on that end, though, and his growth as an off-the-dribble threat helps offset his defensive deficiencies. Although under-qualified to be an alpha scorer due to his limited playmaking for others, Harris would add value to any team hoping to modernize its offense. Unlike Griffin, he’s an easy piece to fit. — BGAlthough Nurkic (14.3 PPG, 9 RPG, 1.4 BPG) just completed his rookie deal, he has rewritten virtually every aspect of his scouting profile. During two-plus seasons in Denver, the Bosnian 7-footer couldn’t finish, couldn’t protect the ball, couldn’t handle big minutes, couldn’t stay healthy, couldn’t serve as a functional backline defender, and couldn’t get along with his coach. Following a 2017 trade, the Blazers embarked on an “Extreme Makeover: Starting Center” mission, encouraging Nurkic to trim down, communicating his role to him clearly, empowering him to pursue his own offense, and entrusting him with major defensive responsibilities.Nurkic, 24, responded in a big way in 2017-18, playing in 79 games and logging more than 2,000 minutes, well above his previous career-highs. He wasn’t just eating up minutes: Nurkic helped Portland improve from No. 21 to No. 8 in defensive rating, he dramatically increased his FG% around the basket, he cut his turnover rate, and he learned to swallow his pride when pulled for match-up purposes in late-game situations. All that progress didn’t help him avoid being torched by Anthony Davis in the playoffs, but it did earn him a four-year, $48 million extension this summer. Next up on the to-do list: ease up on the low-percentage runners, floaters and flip shots that drive Blazermaniacs berserk. — BGAs the NBA has plunged deeper into the smallball era, perception of Valanciunas (12.7 PPG, 8.6 RPG) has seesawed wildly. Once viewed as a potential All-Star, the Lithuanian center became a case study for natural selection on the hardwood: What chance did a lumbering 7-footer have of staying on the court during the playoffs? Rather than overhauling his game to become a full-fledged stretch five, Valanciunas has evolved in softer fashion: exerting maximum effort in fewer minutes, seeking out and exploiting undersized defenders for high-percentage scoring opportunities, dabbling with the three ball, and gradually improving his feel and confidence when forced to defend away from the hoop.The result? Valanciunas, 26, proved to be a skilled battering ram in the 2018 playoffs, notching six double-doubles in 10 games, outplaying Washington’s Marcin Gortat in the first round, and pounding the Cavaliers for 21 points and 21 rebounds in Game 1 of the second round. Yes, the Raptors eventually went down in ugly fashion, but Valanciunas was hardly their weakest link. With excellent durability, well-honed post moves and greater comfort in his refashioned role, Valanciunas has managed to stave off stylistic extinction and trade rumors alike. — BGIt makes perfect sense that Redick (17.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 3.0 APG) would leave the most comfortable fit of his NBA career at age 33 and go on to have his best season yet. Philadelphia made Redick a focal point; he might not have led the Sixers in shot attempts or usage, but Redick’s movement without the ball gave the entire offense its shape. Not many shooters could bear the weight of that kind of role. It works for Redick because of how fluidly he transitions from sprint to shot, making some of the hardest shots in the game look easy.Redick could bring that skill set anywhere, modulating his role as necessary to fit whatever his circumstances require. There is an immutable baseline value for a career 42 % three-point shooter who can hold his own defensively. Redick is more than that. The way he takes the ball in a dribble hand-off and reads the next play in sequence opens up the scope of the entire offense. His screens—yes, screens—throw defenders completely out of sorts. It all comes from the versatility of Redick’s form and release, which allow him to touch so many more aspects of an offense than you might expect. — RMWilliams (22.6 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 5.3 APG) was the easy choice for Sixth Man of the Year last season not because he exemplified the award, but because he transcended it. Bench players don’t score more than 20 points per game (Williams is the first to do so in nearly 30 years). They don’t work as a team’s primary scoring option (Williams not only led the Clippers in assist percentage and overall usage, but used roughly as many possessions as Anthony Davis, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, and DeMar DeRozan). Yet Williams, miraculously, pulled it off—transforming from a novelty scorer into the leader of a top-10 offense.Let’s give credit where it’s due. Williams may be a crummy, undersized defender, but he’s enough of a dynamo to overcome that. Years of clever play have allowed Williams to craft his own unique style through experimentation. One can find incredible latitude when his primary job is to get buckets, and through it Williams has tested thousands of permutations of fakes and footwork to find what works best for him. The more the league leans toward switching defenses, the more valuable players like Williams—who can dutifully run a pick-and-roll or dance their way through an isolation—become. — RMWas Mirotic (15.6 PPG, 7.4 RPG) the biggest winner of the 2018 trade deadline? One minute, he’s in the hospital thanks to a Bobby Portis punch and dreading a return to the aimless, hapless Bulls. The next, he’s joyriding with the Pelicans’ Anthony Davis in one of the NBA’s most exciting offenses, exploding for 30 points in a playoff game while sweeping the Blazers, and cashing Gillette endorsement checks after shaving his trademark beard. What a glow up.The Pelicans were magical when Davis and Mirotic shared the court, posting a +12 net rating in more than 500 minutes. By comparison, New Orleans was +5.9 in roughly 1,100 minutes with Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. In many ways, Mirotic was the anti-Cousins: He was comfortable playing fast, he was accustomed to life as a complementary option, he rarely turned the ball over, he handled switches, and he moved effectively in space on defense. What’s more, he was strong enough on the boards that New Orleans was able to play its preferred smaller lineups, even in the playoffs. For a winning team, the streaky Mirotic is more than a stereotypical stretch four: He does enough dirty work to justify a major role even when he’s slumping. — BGBarnes (18.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.0 APG) is not a first-option scorer, as he’s been cast in Dallas, or a fifth option, as he was in Golden State. His game fits neatly in between, where it can funnel some moderate number of possessions toward mildly efficient ends. It’s nice, though, that he can at least dabble on both extremes of the usage spectrum. The strength of Barnes’s game comes through its variety. Not many spot-up shooters would look just as comfortable working in isolation, or curling around a screen, or posting up a mismatch. And while he’s not exceptional enough in any one category to actually give a team some direction, he’s flexible enough to bend in support of those around him.Teams can play Barnes at the three (as seems to be his preference) or the four without much compromise. There is virtually no risk of him getting played off the floor by a mismatch. Small ball and bully ball alike suit him just fine; if anything, Barnes might be even better at stonewalling bigs trying to work their way to the rim than he is shuffling to stay in front of opposing wings. What matters most, though, is that he’s never a target. Featuring Barnes—whether as the lead in an offense or the focus of an opponent’s game plan—will often lead to underwhelming results. — RMTeague (14.2 PPG, 7.0 APG) is good. Not very good. Not elite. Not average. Not bad. The nine-year veteran is a Trader Joe’s prepackaged dinner, a 3.0 grade point average, a starter home, an L.L. Bean backpack, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with no cone or toppings. He satisfies basic needs and rarely excites. In dark days, his thorough competence inspires faint hope. In better times, he inevitably leaves fans wanting more.As his 2017 arrival in Minnesota proved, the 30-year-old Teague is the right point guard to end a 13-year playoff drought and the right point guard to exit meekly in round one. The Timberwolves boasted the NBA’s fourth-best offense last season, as Teague spread the ball around to his star teammates and filled in the gaps with his own scoring when needed. But he hit a familiar hard ceiling in the playoffs, outmatched and, at times, embarrassed by Houston’s premier backcourt. True to form, he received little attention for his role in Minnesota’s best season since 2004; Likewise, his name was nowhere to be found in the rumors of discontent that have engulfed his higher-profile teammates. As it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. “Good” doesn’t make headlines. — BGRubio (13.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 5.3 APG) is prone to weeks-long mirages of effective shooting, in which it appears—for some fleeting moment—that his long-range accuracy has turned a corner. The back half of last season was the most prolonged and compelling fantasy yet: 41 games in which Rubio made 41% of his threes, coinciding with Utah playing genuinely dominant basketball. That figure will not hold. But to be fair, it doesn’t have to. Given where Rubio is coming from (31.5% shooting on three-pointers over his first six years in the league), even modest, reliable improvement could be transformative.When you’re already one of the best defenders, passers, and rebounders at your position, a smaller step forward can feel like a stride. There are two factors at work (and thus two parallel reasons to believe in his progress last season): Rubio has now posted a career-high effective field goal percentage in three straight seasons, showing a clear developmental arc; and separately, only now is Rubio playing for a coaching staff that seems to really understand him. You can’t just plug Rubio into any system and hope for the best. Utah gets that, and has found ways to push their point guard without missing the boat on what makes him so valuable in the first place. — RM\\xa0If you were to ask a basketball coach to describe their ideal role player, they might unknowingly profile Ingles (11.5 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 4.8 APG). Think about it. They’d want someone who’s easy to play with, like a pass-first wing player who also happens to be one of the best three-point shooters in the league. Beyond that, they’d want someone with enough of a handle to initiate some offense and enough vision to make smart plays. Defensive commitment is a given, and the ability to guard multiple positions is a perk. The player would need to be intensely competitive, but it’s best if they’re also unassuming. Coaches would want the kind of player who understands his team’s principles enough to know when to break them—a delicate blend of reliability and creativity.It’s not hard to find more athletic or higher-scoring players. The trick is finding many who are as good as Ingles when it comes to supplying the things that teams actually need. — RM\\xa0While Murray (16.7 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.4 APG) wasn’t necessarily expected to have an instant impact when he was drafted at age 19, he’s already emerged as a full-time starter and the 2016 class’s leader in games, minutes and points. Now 21, the Canadian product is a prime example of the Stephen Curry Generation: young guards who are encouraged to launch three-pointers at a rate that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. In his second year, Murray attempted more than five threes per game, a threshold that Curry himself didn’t reach until his fourth season at age 24.Denver’s archer is just getting started. After barely missing the playoffs last year, Murray looks like a strong candidate for 2019 Most Improved Player: His per-game stats and efficiency substantially improved in Year Two, he helped lead the Nuggets to 46 wins and the NBA’s No. 6 offense, and his natural scoring instincts proved to be a strong fit with Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris. The hope is that Murray can hone his off-the-dribble three-pointer, a development that could help him join Curry in the 50/40/90 shooting club once his all-around game blossoms. A lack of size and physicality compromise his defensive value, but Murray is fiercer and more competitive than most people realize. Aside from top pick Ben Simmons, he may have the highest ceiling of any player in the 2016 draft. — BG\\xa0For Saric (14.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 2.6 APG), instinct is a propulsive force. The 24-year-old has a preternatural sense of where to be and when. By the time Ben Simmons commits to making a pass, Saric has already raced through the backdoor on his way to the rim. He has a knack for turning up around any loose ball. If the defense is careless enough to box out without securing the rebound, Saric will be the first to it. Should an opponent get careless with a dribble hand-off, Saric might sniff out their negligence and poke the ball away.It’s not easy for a team to build off of that kind of situational awareness, but we saw in the postseason just how fruitful it can be. Saric was completely undaunted by his first playoff run. He stuck to his game—a dynamic mix of cutting, shooting, and playmaking—and found room to contribute across the board. There were always higher priorities for the Sixers than to get Saric involved, and yet he constantly worked his way into the mix. For all the careful planning that goes into an NBA game, sometimes it’s up to players like Saric to help a team find their flow. — RMIn the beginning, Bledsoe (17.7 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.0 APG) requested a trade from the Suns on Twitter—“I don’t wanna be here”—and then tried to deny it by pretending he was merely bored at a hair salon. In the end, he was outplayed and outtalked in the playoffs by Celtics guard Terry Rozier, who confused Bledsoe with a long-forgotten NFL quarterback who shared his surname. In between those memorable memes, the powerful, scoring-minded point guard managed to squeeze in a nice season, providing stability and talent to a Milwaukee backcourt that desperately needed both.Following a November trade to Milwaukee, Bledsoe quickly found his fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, boosting his new team’s offensive rating by nearly eight points when he took the court. While his defensive impact was muted given his propensity for risk-taking and brain farts, Bledsoe’s presence kept the Bucks’ season from being derailed by Malcolm Brogdon’s long-term injury. On balance, his Milwaukee experience revealed that his eye-popping stats from his Phoenix days were inflated, but that he was capable of being an above-average starting point guard on a winning team. Even if it’s not yet clear whether he’s a long-term answer in Milwaukee, the 28-year-old Bledsoe proved to be a heck of a midseason acquisition. — BG \\xa0If healthy, Porzingis (22.7 PPG, 6.6 RPG) would have had a strong case as a top–20 player. By record and point differential, the 2017-18 Knicks were a playoff bubble team with the Latvian big man on the court. After he suffered a season-ending ACL tear in early February, though, New York was pitiful, ranking No. 28 in winning percentage and No. 26 in net rating. Porzingis was on track to solidifying his reputation as a franchise player, and his unfortunate injury was the difference for the Knicks between being competitive and noncompetitive, relevant and irrelevant, watchable and unwatchable.The 23-year-old “Unicorn” lived up to his moniker last season, delivering a positive impact on both sides. He ranked No. 16 in scoring and No. 2 in blocks, shot nearly 40% as a high volume three-point shooter, and allowed just 48.7 FG% on shots attempted within six feet, a basket-protection rate that bested Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis. Unfortunately, the greatest ability is availability, and it’s not yet clear when Porzingis will return to the court or if he will return to his peak level of play during the 2018-19 season. — BGRudy Gobert casts a long shadow, the kind that obscures just how good his frontcourt partner can be. If transported to another team, Favors (12.3 PPG, 7.3 RPG) could anchor a defense all his own with even greater optionality. Gobert is the sort of defender whose strengths are so specific and so pronounced that they all but commit a team to defending a particular way. Any schematic discussion regarding Favors is more open-ended; his team could drop against the pick-and-roll, pressure the ball, switch outright, or even rotate between those options as some highly effective defenses do. No matter the approach, Favors is the kind of big you can trust to execute it.Or, if you’re the Jazz, you can roll out Favors and Gobert in tandem to stomp opponents down by 7.3 points per 100 possessions in the regular season and 10.9 points in the playoffs. Consider those data points with the necessary disclaimers (namely, that the Jazz limit the exposure of those big lineups in matchups they’re poorly suited for), but the reality of playing Favors at the four is less dated than one might think. For opponents other than the Rockets or Warriors, Favors can be punishing. Smaller forwards just don’t have much recourse when Favors rolls to the rim, but playing a more traditional big to counter Favors then plays right into the hands of the Jazz defense. Players don’t need to be dominant to help turn a specific matchup. They need only to have the right combination of skills at the right time, as Favors often does. — RMThe Suns have thrown every conceivable monkey wrench at Booker (24.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.7 APG) during his three seasons: changing coaches, trading away veterans, tanking for months, and whiffing on high draft picks. The 21-year-old shooting guard has responded in admirable fashion, improving his overall efficiency and becoming one of the highest-scoring young prospects in recent memory. Indeed, only four active players averaged more points than Booker during their age-21 seasons: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and Karl-Anthony Towns. By forking over a five-year, $158 million extension this summer, Phoenix is betting that Booker can follow in that group’s All-Star footsteps and lift his team’s 30th-ranked offense to far greater potency.The Kentucky product still needs to prove he’s worthy of his Drake namecheck on “Sicko Mode,” largely because he plays with pick-up game intensity on the defensive end. Phoenix has had a worse defensive rating with Booker on the court than with him off the court in each of his three seasons, and he ranked outside the NBA’s top 200 players by Real Plus-Minus in 2017-18. If he played one-on-one against himself, the game would continue for hours because he would never get a stop. If he played for a better team, he would be hunted mercilessly in the playoffs. With Deandre Ayton and Trevor Ariza arriving to help stabilize and legitimize the Suns, it’s time for Booker to fully commit to leading a downtrodden franchise back to respectability. While Booker reportedly underwent hand surgery this week, the injury did not impact his Top 100 ranking because he's not expected to miss a significant portion of the regular season. — BGHouston has stretched every bit of Gordon’s (18.0 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 2.2 APG) game to its logical extreme. Gordon is remarkably strong for a guard, which means that the Rockets trust him to hold his own defensively against far bigger players. Opponents respect Gordon’s perimeter shooting, so Houston stations him far beyond the three-point arc to clear room for its pick-and-rolls—perhaps at the expense of Gordon’s three-point percentage. What used to be a more balanced shot profile has since polarized; in a fashion suiting Houston’s guiding principles, Gordon now takes well over 60% of his shots from beyond the arc. What mid-range shots he takes are largely provisional—products of when Gordon is asked to create some offense for himself. — RMCovington (12.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 1.7 SPG) warps around the court like a podcast played at double speed, he relishes contact like a middle linebacker, and he shadows scorers feint-for-feint like a professional dancer. With a full season of good health and team success to his name, the 27-year-old Sixers forward has solidified himself as the NBA’s premier 3-and-D wing. His 2018 All-Defensive First Team selection was a no-brainer, as he ranked first in deflections, third in Defensive Real-Plus Minus, fifth in Defensive Win Shares and sixth in steals for the NBA’s third-best defense.Although he is considerably older than star teammates Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, Covington stumbled badly during their first trip to the playoffs. A notoriously streaky shooter who managed to hit 36.9% of his threes during the regular season, he was yanked from the starting lineup in the second round against the Celtics when his jumper and confidence deserted him. Despite a rough May and the narrow nature of his offensive portfolio, Covington is perfectly suited for trendy interchangeable and switchable lineups. He’s satisfied filling a supplementary scoring role, and his combination of strength, length and quickness allows him to credibly defend four, if not all five, positions in smallball looks. Here’s betting that his future postseason work is considerably stronger than his 2018 showing. — BG\\xa0Something about Brown (14.5 PPG, 4.9 RPG) is undeniable. Maybe it’s the way he takes borderline transition opportunities—the kind that other players might slow down and reset—and jams them down the opponent’s throat. It could be wholeheartedness in his soaring contests, each making the dutiful spectacular. More likely, it’s just the fact that Brown plays so hard on both sides of the ball that he’s never far away from some thrilling turn. What looks to be a standard, slow-developing possession can pop with a single cut or deflection. Even within Boston’s particular methodology, Brown knows only how to play in vivid color.It’s no surprise that he’s caught the eye of so many teams around the league, all of which would be thrilled to have a stake in Brown’s future. It took Brown all of two seasons to stabilize as a three-point shooter and calm some of the jumpier aspects of his defense. What might he be capable of in Year Three? Playing out the developmental scenarios is part of the fun, particularly when considering the counterfactuals of the past year.In a world where Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving don’t go down with season-ending injuries, Brown might be seen as more of an energy player than a potential star. Instead, he was force-fed royal jelly while essentially doubling his minutes. So many of the questions that come with young, high-motor players have already been asked and answered. We’ve seen that Brown can sustain his play in starters’ minutes. We know that he can withstand the scrutiny of playoff scouting. What’s beyond us is the future of a fascinating young player whose ceiling is at the mercy of any number of sliding doors. — RMGive Drummond (15 PPG, 16 RPG, 1.6 BPG) credit for seeking methods to evolve his game rather than settling for the dunk-and-rebound stereotype. Last season, the two-time All-Star center reclaimed his status as the NBA’s leading rebounder while also emerging as a capable distributor from the high post and a much-improved foul shooter. Then, in August, he vowed to add the three-point shot to his offensive repertoire after attempting just 30 total threes in his first six seasons.Unfortunately, Drummond’s explorative forays haven’t always produced clear progress in terms of his individual value or his team’s success. While his assist rate improved dramatically in 2017-18, so did his turnover rate. And while all sorts of centers are plotting how they can transform into stretch-fives, Drummond hasn’t exactly demonstrated much touch: He shot an abysmal 31.4% on shots from 3-10 feet and 28.6 from the mid-range last year.\\xa0Frankly, the Pistons’ offense would be better off if he was never allowed to shoot from outside three feet. On the other end, the Drummond/Blake Griffin tandem fared well in a small sample size, providing some much-needed optimism for the wheel-spinning Pistons. Drummond, 25, might never fulfill his wildest dreams, but his size, durability, rebounding instincts and gradual refinements set him apart from replacement-level starting centers. — BGDragić (17.3 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 4.8 APG) plays a dramatic game, forever teetering on the edge of disaster. His signature is to go a step too far; no guard seems to find themselves double- and triple-teamed in the lane quite so often, and none, surely, has been so successful at improbably digging his way out. Some of Dragić’s layups require incredible contortions. His exit strategy often involves hovering in the air until he can sling some wild, wraparound pass. The result is often so impressive—and so improbable—that you forget that the peril was of Dragić’s own making.Yet for all his theatrics, Dragić settles in as merely quite good. It’s not as if his dramatic flair has proven self-destructive; on the contrary, Dragić only turns the ball over at a modest rate relative to other point guards. Miami seems comfortable running its offense through Dragić rather than for him. There are always larger plans at work, and not much of a compelling reason to assign Dragić some outsized role. Two important aspects of Dragić’s game, however, are never up for debate. The first is his fight, which is exceptional even in a competitive league. Dragić is a feisty sort who will never hesitate to drive into traffic, even after his face has swollen to cartoonish extremes. The other is his all-around competence—faint praise, perhaps, but the kind that makes the NBA go. — RMIn the past year, Harris (17.5 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 2.9 APG) proved that he can not only produce within an offense but give it structure. Dribble hand-offs between Harris and Nikola Jokic were as fundamental to Denver’s flow as any other mechanism. Jokic makes Harris look good, but the opposite is also true; a beautiful backdoor feed is only as effective as the cutter who inspires it.Part of what makes Harris so elusive is that you can never be sure where he’s going. Kyle Korver knows how to move without the ball but only has designs to move away from the basket. Andre Roberson is similarly unidirectional, albeit on the opposite track; the only time a defense even pays attention to Roberson’s movement is when he’s headed toward the rim. Harris is a dual threat and more. He could cut off a screen or reject it, move toward the ball or away from it, fake hard in any one direction before reversing course for the other, and take any angle he likes after finally receiving the ball. This is the predicament involved when a player shoots 72% within three feet of the rim and 40% beyond the arc. There is no safe assumption a defender can make —only the tireless work of chasing Harris everywhere he goes. — RMThe departures of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin granted a perfect opportunity to reassess Jordan (12 PPG, 15.2 RPG), a three-time All-NBA selection who served as a third wheel throughout his prime years. The results were mixed: the 30-year-old center remains an elite rebounder and high-efficiency finisher, but his overall defensive impact and rim-protection numbers slipped noticeably.Any faint hope that he might be able to expand his offensive game proved unfounded. After spending a full decade with the Clippers, Jordan drew limited interest and eventually agreed to a one-year, $22.9 million contract with the Mavericks.While Jordan remains an above-average center with standout leaping ability and a deep commitment to hitting the boards, he’s lost some of the pop that made him so devastating. Last season, Jordan’s block rate fell by more than half from his 2016 All-NBA First Team campaign. What’s more, he defended just 346 shots from within six feet (down more than a quarter from two years ago) and allowed 60.4% shooting on those shots (up 8.5% from two years ago). Not surprisingly, the Clippers dropped to 19th in defensive rating from their top-five standing two years ago. When the Mavericks courted Jordan in the fateful summer of 2015, they pitched him on life as a franchise center. At this point, that’s no longer realistic. — BGPorter (14.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) isn’t one to amaze—only to steady his team with quiet capability. The vast majority of his shots are created for him, though Porter adds value the moment the ball touches his hands. If open on the perimeter, Porter (who finished third in three-point percentage last season) is a lights-out shooter with a high release point. Should the defense give his shot the respect it deserves, Porter can drive in response without veering out of control. Restraint is the through line of his game. One can always trust in Porter to play within himself, gifting his coaches and teammates a certain peace of mind. Porter is the player you never have to worry about.These are virtues best appreciated in contrast. If a team were composed entirely of players with Porter’s disposition, the offense might seesaw into eternity one non-committal pick-and-roll at a time. Yet in any more typical ecosystem, Porter would be welcome for his range, his patience, and his defense. Two-way, low-maintenance players are championship mortar. What Porter needs are the right bricks.If an opponent really wanted to scheme away Porter’s offense, they could. There’s nothing particularly intricate going on in how he gets his points. But attaching a defender to deny Porter shots will still serve his intended purpose, making life that much easier on the creators around him. Reducing the game to 4-on-4 will favor any competent offense. Porter, meanwhile, can still assume critical defensive responsibilities and facilitate his team’s best lineups by flexing between positions. Nothing is wasted with Porter, even when he assumes a background role. — RMLast season, Griffin (21.4 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 5.8 APG) posted a points/rebounds/assists line that was matched only by a pair of MVPs: LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. But that superstar-like productivity came draped with red flags: Griffin missed at least 15 games for the fourth straight season, his teams were 28-30 with him on the court, he ranked outside the top-50 in Real Plus-Minus, and his PER and True Shooting % reached career-lows. Unfortunately, a midseason trade to Detroit failed to reverse these trends. That blockbuster deal was harsh and illuminating, as it marked the first time that the Clippers had treated Griffin—whose dynamic athleticism has flatlined due to a series of injuries—as a $173 million contract rather than as a franchise player.As Griffin has sought to modernize his game and protect his body by playmaking from the perimeter and shooting more threes, he’s triggered an identity crisis. After the trade to the Pistons, he took just 21% of his shots from within three feet, well off the 44% from his peak posterization days. Similarly, he attempted just 4.4 free throws per game after the trade, sharply down from 8.4 per game back when he was an MVP candidate. The overwhelming night-to-night physicality that once made Griffin so special appears gone for good at age 29, leaving him as a good-but-not-great scoring threat and an adequate defender. — BGYes, 2017-18 was a junk season for the Grizzlies, and for Gasol, accordingly. Don’t read too much into his downward statistical trend (17.2 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 4.2 APG); once it became clear that Memphis had no shot to compete without Mike Conley, Gasol freewheeled his way through the season without all that much discipline or focus. Give him a real team and he’ll put forth a real effort. Take from that what you will. It might be nice if Gasol were the sort to rally the troops in spite of those circumstances, but there’s only so much playing with Jarell Martin and Ben McLemore a man can take.Decline, however, is inevitable. Gasol’s defense has already slipped; the player who won Defensive Player of the Year by keeping one step ahead of the action is gone thanks to slowing feet and reaction times. Gasol is a 33-year-old center at an especially difficult time to be a 33-year-old center. Just last season, there were only four true bigs who played more than 2,000 minutes at age 32 or older: Gasol, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Marcin Gortat. Every year it will get a little tougher for Gasol to manage a star’s workload in a star’s minutes with a star’s responsibilities.What keeps him buoyant is his playmaking. A team can run its offense through Gasol by stationing him at the elbow or at the three-point line and running guards around him. Orienting an offense in that way opens up the player pool; when a point guard doesn’t have to shoulder the weight of the offense, all sorts of combo guards and kind-of-guards become more viable. New avenues into the offense present themselves. The only way to survive a long season and an ensuing playoff run is through frequent adaptation. Think of Gasol as a means for problem solving—not only to get the ball where it needs to go, but to keep the best players on the floor and arrange them in the most productive ways. — RMThe Boston media spent months comparing Tatum (13.9 PPG, 5 RPG) to NBA legends and predicting a decade’s worth of All-Star appearances for the rookie forward, and then a funny thing happened in the playoffs: He somehow exceeded the hype. Tatum scored 20 points in a Game 7 win over Milwaukee. He easily outdueled 2018 Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons, scoring 20+ points in all five second-round games. And, most impressively of all, he played a leading role in pushing Cleveland to Game 7 in the East finals, where he famously dunked on and chest-bumped LeBron James. Suddenly, the entire global basketball community was gushing like Tommy Heinsohn over Tatum’s poise, polish and gumption.Tatum, 20, possesses all the fundamental elements to become a star wing. He has an effortless shooting stroke, nailing a preposterous 43.4% of his threes as a rookie. He knows a good shot from a bad shot, and he can create quality looks off the dribble and with an array of turnaround moves. He has excellent footwork and pacing. He isn’t reckless or selfish with the ball. He’s quick, long, smart and committed defensively. The biggest question at this point seems to be how quickly Tatum will reach his ceiling in Boston, given that the returns of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward could potentially cut into his touches and shots. Regardless, this much seems clear: Tatum is too skilled to be buried, even on a budding superteam. — BGAdams (13.9 PPG, 9.0 RPG) played the third-most minutes of any center in the league last season because 1) he tends to stay healthy, and 2) he can’t be played off the floor. Any attempt to weed out Adams all but fails before it starts. Small ball is no real deterrent. Adams can hold his own on the perimeter to the point that he isn’t easily exploited. Meanwhile, some poor, undersized center is left to contend with one of the strongest players in the league. If Adams can politely nudge opposing centers out of the way when necessary, what hope does a power forward masquerading as a center really have?The real payoff for that strength comes on offense, where the Thunder grabbed 31.6% of their own misses with Adams on the floor last season, per NBA.com. This is an offense unto itself. Adams may not be scoring all that much, but his efforts renew possessions and redeem low shooting percentages. Solvency comes easy when a team is allowed to take a mulligan on nearly a third of its misses, and potentially more when no true center is around to box Adams out.\\xa0There’s just no working around the fact that Adams is a proper giant. He can wipe out a guard with a screen and bulldoze a big with a roll. Players of that size aren’t supposed to move around the floor so easily, and yet here is Adams, gliding through contact after teaching himself how. You might not consider Adams a standout athlete, but he’s made himself into one. — RMDenver’s bold, expensive off-season play for Millsap (14.6 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.8 APG) had fizzled by Thanksgiving due to a wrist injury that sidelined the four-time All-Star forward for more than half of last season. Although Millsap posted his worst individual numbers in nearly a decade and the Nuggets failed to reach the playoffs for the fifth straight year, there were some promising signs. For starters, Denver posted a +4.1 net rating with Millsap on the court—equivalent to the league’s No. 6 ranking—and he made the Nuggets more efficient on both sides. Perhaps most importantly, Millsap and Nikola Jokic posted a strong +8 net rating in nearly 900 minutes together, providing convincing evidence that the frontcourt pairing will work well in 2018-19 if healthy.The 33-year-old Millsap has entered the decline stage of a typical age curve, yet his role flexibility should help soften the blow. Thanks to his unselfish nature and capable three-point shooting, he doesn’t need to dominate the ball to be a helpful offensive player. His willingness to shift down to a complementary role—something some former All-Stars reject outright—provides room for the Nuggets’ young backcourt to blossom. Plus, his savvy, workmanlike and versatile defensive game provides cover for the multiple minus defenders that surround him in the starting lineup. If the Nuggets vault into the playoffs as some projection models expect, Millsap’s fingerprints will be all over the rise even if he is overshadowed by his flashier teammates. — BG\\xa0Were there no concern for injury, Conley—a two-way, All-Star-level guard—would rank far better than he does here. To actually follow through on that ranking, however, would require rationalizing away the 109 games that Conley missed over the past three years. There is no single, chronic injury at work but an assortment of seemingly unrelated issues. The latest was a bone intrusion in his left heel, addressed through surgery back in January. Conley is as resilient as athletes come, but his resilience is also tested more often than most. Any predictive ranking must account for that, particularly with Conley now in his early 30s.This disclaimer is made with the full knowledge that a healthy Conley is a freaking terror. Very few point guards can match his creative depth; Conley has the handle and quickness to go anywhere he wants on the floor, not to mention the skill and touch to score when he gets there. Conley’s game is setups on setups on setups. What looks like an actual move—and would be in lesser hands—is really just prologue, scripted to set expectations for the sole purpose of defying them. By the time Conley’s defender realizes they’re stuck in the blender, it’s already too late.There’s no weak hand to shade, and no range at which you can give Conley space. The last time we saw Conley really do his thing, he was bombing away from beyond the arc with the frequency of Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, and Devin Booker—all while hitting better than 40%. His array of runners is the envy of the league. Some scoring option is always available to him, though Conley is perfectly willing to move the ball and defer to the offense. The most dangerous moment in guarding Conley comes then: At the moment of exhale, before it clicks that he only gave up the ball to get it back on a dribble hand-off. — RMAs one of the NBA’s top young centers, it’s no surprise that Capela (13.9 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 1.9 BPG) has buttered his bread in the basket area: He shot a league-high 65.2% thanks to a parade of lobs, defended a league-high 588 shots from within six feet, and ranked eighth with 42 double-doubles. Unlike many of his positional counterparts, though, the 24-year-old Capela has found numerous ways to inject mobility into possessions. He doesn’t camp on the block looking for post-up opportunities, and he covers ground from end to end like few players his size. Even when Houston goes to its slow-down half-court isolation mode, Capela darts through space to set high screens and knifes through multiple bodies to chase offensive rebounds.In the West finals, Capela’s unique combination of length, agility and activity made him surprisingly resilient against the Warriors. Houston’s two favorite lineups against Golden State both featured Capela instead of a small-ball five, and together the groups were a net-positive over the seven-game series. He can’t play-make or shoot the three like Draymond Green, but Capela represents a new archetype for a modern title contender: a rim-running, screen-setting, alley-ooping, glass-crashing and shot-blocking center who can show and switch against all five positions without getting embarrassed. Houston, understanding Capela’s rare skill profile, wisely inked him to a five-year, $90 million deal in late July. — BGHis game has drawn endless comparisons to Dwyane Wade and his marketability is straight from the Damian Lillard playbook, but the recent star that Mitchell (20.5 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.7 APG) most embodied down the stretch was a young Derrick Rose. The unadulterated calm and confidence. The willingness to sacrifice life and limb to get to the rim. The savior scoring role on a roster built for defense. The ability to get veteran teammates to buy in—fully and eagerly—to everything he was selling. The measured responses to stunning triumphs. The euphoric embrace from his home crowd.Such lofty comparisons are appropriate for Mitchell, who became just the third rookie guard to average 20+ PPG since 1990. The 22-year-old guard kept raising the bar as he led Utah past Oklahoma City in the first round: 28 points in Game 2 to steal homecourt advantage, 33 points in Game 4 to take a 3-1 lead, and then 38 points in Game 6 to send Russell Westbrook packing. While the Rockets were able to dissect the Jazz in round two, Mitchell’s postseason debut made it clear that he’s set up for major success. His next steps—improving as a three-point shooter, getting to the line more frequently, and growing as a facilitator—are refinements rather than quantum leaps. If Rose was Chicago’s first superstar of the post-Jordan era, Mitchell might very well become Utah’s most beloved and decorated player since Stockton and Malone. — BGWhen a Twitter heckler requested that he stay focused on advancing in the playoffs rather than talking trash about the Warriors, McCollum (21.4 PPG, 4 RPG, 3.4 APG) responded by unleashing a plaintive wail that inspired tribute t-shirts: “I’m trying Jennifer.” The viral comeback was doubly honest, as it reflected McCollum’s dedication to his craft and acknowledged Portland’s painful back-to-back first-round sweeps. Indeed, there can be no questioning the 2016 Most Improved Player’s commitment: McCollum has missed just five total games over the past three seasons, he’s forged a successful and non-combative star partnership with Damian Lillard, and he was a rare bright spot for the Blazers in the 2018 playoffs.In many ways, McCollum, 26, has developed into an ideal No. 2 scoring option: he can create a shot, he can run the offense for a bench-heavy lineup, he can attack mismatches, he can shoot the three, he can draw attention when he’s off the ball, and he has a good feel for when to defer versus when to take over. Despite this, Portland’s hard ceiling has led observers to wonder whether he would be better suited to running his own team or whether Lillard would be better off paired with a bigger, longer and more defensive-minded partner. Here’s a more compelling hypothetical: How far could Lillard and McCollum go together if GM Neil Olshey ever gave them a league-average supporting cast? Chances are, the Jennifers of the world would need to find new material. — BGBefore you hold Charlotte’s poor performance against Walker, note that the Hornets were actually a winning team whenever he was on the floor. In those minutes, Charlotte outscored their opponents by 3.5 points per 100 possessions, according to NBA.com—a comparable margin to that of the 55-27 Celtics. Walker (22.1 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 5.6 APG) was a star in all matters he could actually control. Holding him accountable for a disastrous backup point guard rotation would be akin to blaming him for concession prices or parking availability.If anything, Walker had a valiant year. His play was the saving grace of an undermanned roster, which he led without making a fuss. Even when he was featured in trade rumors of the team owner’s own making, Walker went out of his way to express loyalty to the city and organization that brought him into the NBA. When he had every right to be frustrated, Walker just went to work.It’s easy to play for a teammate like that. Walker digs in, as is evident through his continued self-improvement. The subtle refinement of his off-the-dribble game has made Walker a better creator and the transformation of his jumper has made him a bigger threat; together, that combination has cinched his reputation as one of the most prolific pull-up jumpshooters in the league. Walker created about as many unassisted threes last season as anyone not named James Harden. Opponents, now wise to this, are tempted to overreact. The more dangerous Walker becomes, the better the opportunities for his teammates that result. It’s only the most obvious way that Walker makes the players around him better. — RMLet’s establish, first, what Love (17.6 PPG, 9.3 RPG) is not. Love is not a helpful defender. One stop—no matter how crucial—doesn’t overwrite hours of film in which Love has been targeted and exploited. Love is not a primary scorer for a playoff-caliber team. The memory of Minnesota Love isn’t just five years old, but a relic of a different time altogether. Even if he could tap back into that version of himself, today’s defenses are better schooled in tracking Princeton-style movement and more aware of Love’s limitations. Love, though, is not just a role player. The cost of playing alongside LeBron James is the reduction of your game to its most basic elements. That got the Cavs to four straight Finals but reduced Love to a standstill shooter in the process.Love can make that work (he rated as one of the most efficient spot-up shooters in the league last season, per Synergy Sports), but not only that. The great casualty of his move to Cleveland was the opportunity to make plays. When the Cavs put the ball in Love’s hands, they did so with the intention that he get buckets rather than run offense. It’s an important distinction. Love doesn’t really have the handle or the post game to manufacture shots on command. But letting him read the action for an offense that actually moves could work to the benefit of all involved. Love, even through the simplest implementation, is a star who can create real problems for opposing bigs. The only question is how far his team wants to go to maximize what he does best. — RM\\xa0DeRozan (23.0 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 5.2 APG) made an earnest effort to reformat his game last season that, in the end, didn’t mean much. Encouraging as it was for DeRozan to venture beyond the arc in the regular season, he bailed on the notion of even attempting a three-pointer in the playoffs—after missing 13 straight. The free-flowing style of the Raptor offense encouraged DeRozan to move the ball until it didn’t; once the system clammed up in the second round, so, too, did DeRozan’s passing. There is more to DeRozan than how he performed against LeBron James and the Cavs. That said, the end of that series (also the end of DeRozan’s Raptors career) was especially vivid: a Game 3 benching followed by a Game 4 ejection, giving way to a sweep, a trade, and the end of an era.The lesson of the Raptors is that a franchise could easily build a playoff team around DeRozan. It’s building a championship team that’s the trouble—in part because a seven-game series airs out DeRozan’s every liability. In that setting, his defense becomes catastrophic, as was the case against the Cavs. Free throws are harder to come by. The same moves that worked for DeRozan throughout the regular season become tougher to pull off against carefully tailored defenses. And when his scoring game stalls, DeRozan—who doesn’t really cut and doesn’t trust his own three-point shooting—has no real way to contribute.I say all this only to illustrate the differences between the two DeMars. One is a rock: a steadying influence through a long regular season. The other is not, until he proves otherwise. \\xa0— RMIt would come as no surprise if Damian Lillard still jolts awake in the dead of night, the memory of Holiday’s playoff defense still fresh in his mind. There are defenders who try hard, who play smart, and who put on a good show. Holiday (19.0 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.0 APG) cuts straight through everything to deny a scorer that which he holds dear. It doesn’t take him long to figure out where his opponent wants the ball, and once he does, he shuts down most every lifeline leading there.Holiday is one of the NBA’s best defensive players. The usual limitations regarding point guards don’t really apply; he’s tall (a listed 6’4”), he’s long (his wingspan, at the time of his drafting, was measured at 6’7”), and he’s too strong to be pushed around. That gave New Orleans the flexibility to move Holiday between perimeter assignments as needed. Against the Warriors, for example, Holiday was the Pelicans’ best shot at defending Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.It’s a wonder where he finds the energy. Holiday works a double shift under a huge minutes load: first as a defensive stopper, then as one of the leaders of an offense. New Orleans brought in another point guard (Rajon Rondo) to help Holiday manage, though functionally his role wasn’t all that different; New Orleans was still at its best when Holiday was able to direct traffic, and his production held regardless of whether Rondo was on the floor with him. Holiday is a universal complement. Play him at either guard spot and in almost any capacity. His game knows no bad fit. — RMAfter a hamstring injury cost him most of the 2016-17 season, Middleton (20.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.0 APG) bounced back better than even his most optimistic supporters could have hoped. The versatile 27-year-old wing posted career-highs in scoring, rebounds, assists, PER, True Shooting % and Win Shares while playing all 82 games and logging nearly 3,000 minutes. Milwaukee’s season saw all sorts of ups and downs, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo/Middleton pairing was reliable and successful throughout. The duo crested during a first-round series against Boston, when Antetokounmpo left Brad Stevens shaking his head with multiple 30-point games and a scorching-hot Middleton posted a playoff-best 71.9 TS%.Middleton, much like Paul George, is ideally suited to a No. 2 role, and his completely transferrable game could complement everyone from Antetokounmpo to James Harden to Anthony Davis. Offensively, he can shoot the three, create a shot, and generate high-percentage scoring opportunities by beating help defense with the pass. Defensively, he can switch seamlessly through multiple positions and handle lead assignments thanks to his quickness and length. The Bucks’ next step under new coach Mike Budenholzer is clear: Construct a five-man offensive system that reduces the need for Antetokounmpo and Middleton to grind out isolation half-court buckets. With a little more structural help and a little less one-on-one, the understated Middleton might finally achieve the recognition and postseason success that has long eluded him. — BGThis was a stretch season for Beal (22.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 4.5 APG), who not only played all 82 games for the first time in his career but went half that time without John Wall. The experience was illuminating. We saw Beal run even more pick-and-roll than usual, approaching each with a new disposition. Taking over the responsibility for an offense can’t help but change a player. Even though Beal will always see the game as a scorer first, he was more patient when it came to reading the floor and letting his options develop. The lesson, contrary to the extreme reaction at the time, was not that the Wizards are better off without Wall. It was that the Wizards are better off without Wall dominating the offense, which Beal could do more to help orchestrate.Every year, Beal’s handle gets a little tighter. His crossovers these days aren’t quite so unruly, which allows him to work in straighter lines. The more direct Beal’s game is, the better; he’s so good at slamming on the brakes—only to pull-up for a jumper or pivot into one—that any momentum he generates works to his advantage. Beal’s touch is natural, but his moves are earned. You can see the patterns in his footwork that would only materialize through repetition, as he sorts out how to attack out of any situation and at any angle. Maybe the most underrated part of Beal’s game is the sheer accessibility of his scoring. No matter where he’s positioned, there’s always a way through. — RMAlthough Simmons (15.8 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 8.2 APG) is only 22 years old, he has already provided convincing answers to most of the pre-draft questions that surfaced in 2016. He’s not a point guard? Simmons was the lead ball-handler for one of the league’s most devastating five-man lineups, claiming 2018 Rookie of the Year honors and joining John Wall as the only rookies to average 15+ PPG and 8+ APG during the last 20 years. He has a questionable motor? Simmons came out of the gate as a clear plus defender—ranking 35th league-wide in Real Plus-Minus—while also carrying Philadelphia to eight straight wins without Joel Embiid to close the season. He won’t be able to bully his way to the hoop against NBA-caliber defenders like he did in college and high school? Simmons’s shot distribution chart looks like it belongs to an elite center, as he hit 74.4% of his shots in the basket area and took nearly half of his attempts from within three feet.There was, of course, one knock that did stick: his total lack of shooting. Despite playing more than 2,700 minutes, Simmons attempted just 11 three-pointers and didn’t make any. Among established star-level perimeter players, there really isn’t a modern comparison for that degree of perimeter futility, although John Wall, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and DeMar DeRozan all struggled mightily early in their careers. Philadelphia’s second-round series loss to Boston proved that Simmons can’t always work around his Achilles heel. Without a jumper to extend the defense, the Australian point forward was held in check, stymied by the Celtics’ interior bodies and forced into more turnovers than the Sixers could stomach. Yet focusing only on his uneven play against Boston would be misrepresentative of a spectacular rookie season: Simmons is one of the NBA’s brightest young lights, and he appears poised to make his All-Star Game debut in 2019. — BGThis ranking takes a relatively conservative view on Hayward, who suffered gruesome, compounding leg injuries five minutes into his first game of the 2017-18 season. Should Hayward look just as good as he did before those injuries (or better), a spot in the top 20 could be entirely reasonable. It just can’t be guaranteed—not after Hayward was immobilized, reduced to shooting from a chair, and categorically ruled out even as the Celtics played late into May. A full, uncomplicated recovery can’t always be taken on faith.What’s more certain is Hayward’s skill level. It’s probably for the best if he isn’t his team’s leading scorer, though all other options are on the table. His game is deeply agreeable. More fluid systems could lean on Hayward to read his surroundings and make plays, while a more scripted offense could fall back on his ability to cut and curl. Hayward has made himself into the kind of wing who can consistently hit difficult shots; years of working off the ball have led him to make the most of tight windows, while a stronger frame helps to absorb contact in the middle of a runner or jumper.He’ll be great for the Celtics because he’d be great pretty much anywhere. Two-way wings create possibilities. They don’t necessitate playing any certain way, but they make it easier to adapt—particularly when, like Hayward, they can guard well across three positions. There isn’t an offense Hayward can’t better or a defense he can’t execute. His game is all options. — RMAs always, Wall (19.4 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 9.6 APG) has paid careful attention to the perception of his standing relative to his peers, noting in an August interview with NBA Sports Washington that “a lot of guys don’t talk about me being a top-five point guard.” Although SI.com ranked Wall as the fifth-best point guard and 13th overall player at this time last year, it’s impossible to argue that he lived up to that billing. The five-time All-Star missed half the season due to injury, ranked outside the top 45 by PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP, and was quickly bounced in the first round of the playoffs. At 28, Wall has never led a 50-win team, he’s led just one top-10 offense, and he’s won just three total playoff series during his eight-year career. That body of work doesn’t compare—at all—to the likes of Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook.If Wall returns to full health and 20/10 production, he belongs in the mix for a top-five spot with the next tier of point guards: Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving and Kyle Lowry. But regaining his footing in that conversation requires more than just flashing his incredible athleticism, maintaining his improved three-point percentage, and recommitting himself on the defensive end. Wall spent a good portion of last year sniping with Marcin Gortat, and his ball-dominant approach briefly led critics to wonder if Washington was better off without him when he was injured. If Wall can make meaningful strides as an inclusive and empowering leader both on and off the court, the Wizards are far more likely to reach their playoff ceiling. When that happens, he won’t need to waste his time and energy fighting for respect. He’ll get his due. — BGKudos to Lowry (16.2 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 6.9 APG), the sole remaining survivor in Toronto’s triumvirate of blame. With Dwane Casey and DeMar DeRozan both gone following another humiliating loss to LeBron James, it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what the coach and his star guards accomplished together: five straight seasons with 48+ wins, the five winningest seasons in franchise history, five playoff appearances, four playoff series victories, and a trip to the East finals. During Lowry’s six-year tenure in Toronto, the Raptors have won 297 games, the most of any Eastern Conference team. Now, at age 32, Lowry will plunge forward with a rookie coach and a rehabilitated Kawhi Leonard in search of his first trip to the Finals.Although Lowry’s individual numbers diminished last season, the fall-off was mostly attributable to a more careful management of his minutes rather than a dramatic change in his ability. The four-time All-Star logged five fewer minutes per game during the regular season, a substantial strategic adjustment that helped him play 78 games and turn in easily the most efficient postseason of his career. While Lowry remains a strong outside shooter and a dynamic all-around offensive player, his age might be starting to show on the other end. He led the league with 37 drawn charges in 2017-18, but his impact stats weren’t quite as impressive as in recent years. This much is clear: No one benefits more from Leonard’s arrival than Lowry, who gets to move to a shotgun role alongside an MVP-level champion at the exact moment his own window as an elite point guard was starting to close. — BGPondering Thompson (20 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 2.5 APG) in a vacuum is a far more enriching mental exercise than assessing his play with the Warriors because he is the definition of a known quantity. The 28-year-old sharpshooter has produced nearly identical numbers for four straight seasons now, ranking among the NBA’s deadliest three-point marksmen and its most respected perimeter defenders.Although a fluky thumb injury caused him to miss a career-high nine games in 2017-18, Thompson was as lethal as ever during the postseason run to Golden State’s third title in four years. His personal highlight: draining nine three-pointers in a do-or-die Game 6 in the West finals, a season-saving explosion that mirrored his epic Game 6 against the Thunder two years earlier.When listing off the reasons that the Warriors are “unfair,” don’t forget that their third option is a stone-cold sniper with a quick trigger who also happens to love grinding out defensive possessions against star wings.Place Thompson on a team with average talent and a need for him to play a leading role, and there’s no telling exactly how things would turn out. His limitations as an off-the-dribble creator and a playmaker for others would show through quickly, and his efficiency would surely dip with lower-percentage looks. How hard would he need to work to get open without Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant? Would his occasional streakiness be held against him more often if he was the No. 1 option? Would his pressure defense be held in the same regard if Draymond Green wasn’t behind him to play clean up? These are intriguing questions, but they will remain hypotheticals for the foreseeable future thanks to Thompson’s willingness to sacrifice in Ginobili-like fashion. Here in reality, he’s bound to keep swishing threes and stacking rings in his perfect role with the champs. — BGAldridge (23.1 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 2.0 APG) returns after a genuinely remarkable season, in which he reconciled with the Spurs, staved off decline, and played every bit to an All-NBA standard. San Antonio’s offense was solvent solely because of him. All the ball movement was cute, but 20 seconds of good intentions often ended in Aldridge bailing his teammates out. A lack of shooting in the lineup left Aldridge the space of a broom closet. He responded with arguably his best season to date, anchoring a 47-win team in the process.It’s less than ideal to rely on Aldridge in that way, but—as the Spurs proved—it’s really not the worst thing in the world. When he’s comfortable, Aldridge is tough to deny. His usual array of shots is easily manufactured, even in the face of attentive defense. Those opponents who can cause problems for Aldridge’s face-up game won’t generally have much impact on his back-to-the-basket play. There’s only so much that can be done to challenge the release of a 6’11” shooter from all angles.Some regression could be in order. Aldridge wasn’t unusually accurate from any range last season in a way that would raise alarm, but he is a 33-year-old with more than a decade of star-level usage. That hurts his case in a top-25 field that is otherwise quite young—full of players either in the thick of their primes or with their best years still to come. Aldridge is on the other side. The question is not whether his numbers hold but for how long. — RMBefore last season, Oladipo (23.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.3 APG) barely needed a trophy case: the 2013 No. 2 pick’s unspectacular career was highlighted by a second-place finish in the 2015 Slam Dunk Contest, an $84 million extension that many observers felt was too generous, and a front-row seat for Russell Westbrook shooting 34 times in an elimination-game defeat. Now? Oladipo has enough hardware to start a personal shrine after earning Most Improved Player, All-Star, All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive First Team honors in one of the great mid-career breakouts in recent memory.The 26-year-old scoring guard displayed numerous improvements following a trade from Oklahoma City to Indiana: he shot the three at a career-high rate, he worked in a more reliable off-the-dribble jumper, he attacked the rim with greater purpose, and he committed to becoming a disruptive defender on a nightly basis. Importantly, Oladipo also settled in as a late-game option, ranking fourth in clutch scoring and leading the pesky, overachieving Pacers to a 24-17 record in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Perhaps the best way to gauge Oladipo’s value came when he was sidelined for seven games: Indiana went 0-7 and lost by an average of 14 points. The East’s No. 5 seed could have been mistaken for the Suns or Grizzlies without its franchise player.\\xa0This ranking reflects a degree of skepticism that Oladipo’s sensational season—he ranked sixth in Real Plus-Minus, 11th in WARP and 19th in PER—is his new normal. However, his explosiveness, buy-in, and two-way impact should keep him in the All-Star conversation, even if he sustains natural regression or falters a bit under enhanced expectations. — BGTowns (21.3 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 2.4 APG) has every tool at his disposal, every advantage one could hope for. If only he had full command of them. Scoring comes easy; Towns is one of the few genuinely dominant post players left, though in his spare time he moonlights as a 42.1% three-point shooter and one of the\\xa0quickest-driving centers in the league. It’s the combination of those skills that makes Towns’s occasional disappearances—as in the first few games of Minnesota’s lone playoff series—all the more mystifying. In those moments, he looked every bit a 22-year-old.For as much as Towns can do, there’s still a lot he hasn’t quite figured out. Defense seems to elude him—an issue made all the more glaring by his position. When a young guard takes a bad angle or gives up on a play, there are multiple levels of defensive infrastructure to bail him out. Not so for centers, who are asked to make split-second decisions and cover tons of ground with no safety net. Mastering the rhythms of team defense is as difficult as any part of NBA life. Towns, though, is still striving for competence.He’ll get there. In the meantime, the Wolves will have to settle for his unbelievable efficiency, his strong rebounding, and his matchup-detonating versatility. The thrill with Towns is knowing that this is only the beginning. If some part of his game hasn’t quite crystallized, check back in a few months. — RMJokic (18.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 6.1 APG) has the Midas touch, where every pass that leaves his hand fosters some golden opportunity. He’ll find a cutter well beyond the bounds of typical offense. A shooter will have a cross-court pass from Jokic drop straight into his shooting pocket, synced perfectly to an opponent’s rotation. The degree to which Jokic makes his teammates better is genuinely staggering. If you can shoot or move or score at all, his vision will all but guarantee a career year. Hell, Denver’s equipment manager probably goes on to have a productive day whenever Jokic hands over his jersey for laundry or his shoes for storage. It’s uncanny.That rising tide reflects especially well on Jokic for the purposes of this exercise. If we assume that every player on our list is surrounded by fairly average teammates as a sort of vacuum test, Jokic is among the most likely to elevate them. A middling role player will rarely look so good as when Jokic is force-feeding them points. This was a key point of separation between Jokic and Karl-Anthony Towns in the determination of their rankings. Both rebound well, space the floor, and score at similar rates. Neither is much of a defender. Jokic, though, averaged more assists per game than any other center in the three-point era, and has the receipts to prove his passing’s effect. One could easily prefer Towns as a matter of taste, though Jokic might do slightly more for an offense at this point in their careers. — RMIrving (24.4 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.1 APG) spent his first season with the Celtics in effortless synchronicity, right up until the deflating moment that knee complications brought it to a premature end. The five-time All-Star point guard was quick on the ball, flirting with the first 50/40/90 season of his career and thriving in space as the lead playmaker in a well-balanced attack. He was quick as a professional, landing himself on a premier franchise and a budding superteam after foreseeing Cleveland’s demise and the shifting tides in the East. And he was quick to dispel numerous criticisms that had built up during his Cavaliers tenure. Throughout a brilliant 16-game winning streak, Irving proved that he could thrive as an alpha rather than as a sidekick, that he could balance his scoring and distributing without rubbing his co-stars the wrong way, that he could be the major personality on a winning team despite his quirks, and that he could play big minutes on an elite defense.Unfortunately, the 26-year-old Irving’s substantial personal progress, a postseason date with former teammate LeBron James, and a likely trip to the Finals all went poof when he was lost for the season in mid-March. Irving has now missed 21% of his team’s regular-season games during his seven-year career, and another injury this season would complicate his 2019 free agency. As the former No. 1 pick progresses through his prime, health clearly represents the last major hurdle separating him from an annual spot on the All-NBA teams and a consensus “Top 10” reputation. —BGHorford (12.9 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 4.7 APG) is a patron saint of the Top 100, in that he embodies so many of the attributes we tend to value highly. He plays both sides of the ball without condition, and in a way that makes everyone around him better. His game is both reliable enough to anchor a team and versatile enough to allow for changes on the fly. He fits the modern game. Nothing in Horford’s style or skill set would make him a target in a playoff series. If anything, his incredible basketball literacy would poke holes in an opponent’s game plan in real time. The way he plays upholds a standard and the way he carries himself can establish a culture. Horford exudes a winning effect. He was one of the most important players in the entire league last season, and this ranking reflects that.At the same time, evaluating the future of any 32-year-old deserves some caution—as does isolating the value of any one, particular Celtic. Horford could be at his absolute best in Boston, if only because the organization seems to value him fully. Yet even if he were playing with lesser teammates for a lesser coach, Horford would invariably raise the level of execution. He’s too smart not to. If his influence didn’t bear out through his own individual defense, it would in the way he directs traffic. Even if he wasn’t in a position to make plays, Horford would intuitively screen or space the floor for others.From an impact perspective, Horford is only a few degrees removed from Draymond Green. Both rank among the league’s best defensive players (Horford, for what it’s worth, led the top defense overall) and augment high-functioning offenses with their playmaking. And each, in his own way, has made himself completely indispensable to one of the best teams in the league. The Celtics were forced to do without their two biggest stars last season. They marched all the way to the Eastern Conference finals regardless—because their most valuable player was still in uniform. — RMAfter years of griping about his All-Star snubs, Lillard (26.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.6 APG) backed into a far better honor: The 2018 All-NBA First Team. For once, the murky voting criteria—stats, winning, name recognition, narrative—coalesced in his favor. The 28-year-old point guard was healthier than Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Jimmy Butler, and his Blazers were steadier and more functional than Russell Westbrook’s Thunder. His statistical portfolio was impeccable: He ranked top five in scoring, top 10 in clutch points, top 10 in PER, Win Shares and WARP, and top 15 in Real Plus-Minus. And Lillard had a compelling story too: He was a highly-respected offensive weapon, an improved defender, and the unquestioned leader of an overachieving No. 3 seed.By the time Lillard’s well-deserved moment in the sun was announced in May, Portland was smarting from an embarrassing first-round sweep against New Orleans. Although that series exposed Lillard’s struggles in the face of a physical trapping defense, it was a more damning indictment of his weak supporting cast.Kyrie Irving might be a better and more exciting ball-handler than Lillard, but he’s had consistent health problems and likely wouldn’t fare much better when surrounded by lineups with two or three holes. Kyle Lowry might be more imposing and experienced than Lillard, but he’s had his own postseason struggles despite much deeper rosters around him. John Wall might be faster and more explosive than Lillard, but his shot selection and questionable leadership are unavoidable concerns. In this tier of imperfect star point guards, Lillard seems to possess the most dependable strengths and the most manageable flaws. — BGGobert (13.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 2.3 BPG) is so imposing that he actually changes the psychology of a game. Opponents with the ball in hand turn their focus inward; you can see confident players talk themselves out of shots they would ordinarily love to take, all for fear of Gobert swatting them away. Many teams will go to amazing lengths to pull Gobert away from the basket—challenging him laterally rather than vertically—but there’s only so much you can do to separate from a 7’1” shot-blocker with Gobert’s instincts. An incredible number of plays will always be in his reach.His presence provides a sense of order, a way of life. Utah orients its entire defense around Gobert, knowing that he’ll not only influence a ton of shots himself, but give teammates license to apply their own pressure. This has a constricting effect. Passing lanes are tighter. Driving lanes are contested. It’s difficult to even work through your offense against Gobert and the Jazz, much less score. Defenders are emboldened at every turn, channeling Gobert’s confidence. Gobert plays with the sureness of a player who knows exactly what he is. There are no misconceptions to his game—no indulgent post-ups or rash dribble moves. Just no-frills, highly efficient offense predicated on putting as little space between him and the rim as possible. Cutting off his access to the basket is easier said than done; even last season’s Rockets, who switched as capably as any team in the league, couldn’t entirely deny Gobert’s rolls, cuts, and put-backs. There are some things you can never take away from a seven-footer when he’s wholly committed to playing his game. — RM“There are 82-game players, then there are 16-game players.” The Athletic reported that bit of wisdom was delivered by Green (11 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 7.3 APG) to Golden State’s front office as draft advice, but the distinction helps explain the versatile power forward’s evolution as he continues through his prime. Now, more than ever, the 28-year-old Green is a 16-game player: a dynamic defensive mastermind who saves his best work for the playoffs.During the Warriors’ third title run, Green played a key role in defending LaMarcus Aldridge and Anthony Davis while offering constant help on the likes of James Harden, Chris Paul and LeBron James. He led Golden State in minutes, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals during the playoffs. His absurd 99.5 defensive rating was a major reason the champs skated through Stephen Curry’s absence, survived Kevin Durant’s choppy stretches in the West finals, and swept James out of Cleveland in the Finals. And despite being listed at 6’7”, Green led the NBA by defending 158 shots from within six feet during the playoffs. He allowed just 54.4% on those shots, a postseason rim-protection rate that’s comparable to long-armed shot-blockers like Davis and Clint Capela.Green’s offensive utility has slipped slightly over the last two years: his three-point shooting has regressed, and his pick-and-roll playmaking has taken a backseat to accommodate Durant’s arrival. Regardless, he’s a skilled and willing passer who would be able to function as a quality secondary playmaker even if he wasn’t surrounded by All-Stars on all sides. The eye test and his impact stats agree that Green has learned to dial back his effort level in the regular season, and that’s a luxury he wouldn’t have on most teams. Then again, Green’s postseason prowess and leadership during big moments are major reasons why Golden State can get away with coasting in the first place. — BGLeonard (16.2 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.3 APG) ranked fourth on last year’s SI.com Top 100 because he possesses so many of the qualities this list aims to celebrate and appreciate: he boasts a complete and refined game, his presence makes his team better on both ends, his scoring game is multi-dimensional and efficient, he’s a premier perimeter defender, he’s a proven playoff performer, he’s painstakingly worked to eliminate his weaknesses, and his game would easily mesh with any cast of teammates. Leonard is a perennial MVP candidate, he’s the best player in Raptors history even though he hasn’t played a game yet, and he would be the best teammate LeBron James has ever had if he joins the Lakers next summer. In short, he was a 20+ points per game scorer and very nearly a 50/40/90 shooter in the same year he won 2016 Defensive Player of the Year. That is the definition of immense value on the hardwood.Clearly, there’s a major “but…” coming now. But, at this moment in his career, Leonard finds himself needing to reestablish a quality that is essential to leadership and winning: reliability. This is a question of both health and demeanor. After playing just nine games last season, the 27-year-old Leonard has now missed 27% of his team’s regular-season games during his career. To make matters worse, he behaved in reprehensible fashion for a max-level franchise player throughout his injury absence, drawing soft rebukes and subliminal digs from his legendary coach and teammates.\\xa0Regardless of what happened behind closed doors or on the training table, Leonard is solely responsible for months of poor communication, for his ill-fated “Spur for life” press conference, and for the distracting “Uncle Dennis” chatter. He’s solely responsible for leaving his teammates up in the air about his availability in the run-up to the playoffs and for staying away from the Spurs during the postseason. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Anthony Davis would never behave like Leonard did because they understand and accept that being an A-list superstar requires comporting oneself like a chief executive.While James’s move to L.A. will garner 1,000 times more attention, Leonard’s arrival in Toronto is nearly as intriguing and arguably more influential on the 2019 title picture. Will Leonard take James’s place as the East’s best player and lead the Raptors to the Finals after so many postseason heartbreaks? Or, will Leonard’s silence and loud free-agency rumors doom Toronto like they did San Antonio? How will he adjust to life under a rookie head coach after seven years with Gregg Popovich? Will a potential Hall of Fame career that launched with such promise—a Finals MVP at age 22—get back on track or derail further? — BGGeorge (21.9 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 3.3 APG) is a great shooter in a league that runs on shooting, a choice defender for some of the most difficult matchups, and a flexible star at a time when amassing talent is the only real way to compete. Indiana gave George the opportunity to lead a team of his own, which only led him to relish a day he didn’t have to. He is a star built for these times—both fully capable of taking a team over the top and fully aware of how much help it takes to win.Playing in Oklahoma City works for him. George does his best work when he doesn’t have to handle the ball on every possession, which is never really a problem with Russell Westbrook around. Both operate in ways that make the other’s job easier: Westbrook’s shot creation is a relief to George, who can do more of his work off the ball. Meanwhile, George is enough of a draw that a defense can’t just load up against Westbrook’s drives. One pushes, the other pulls.In truth, George could have that kind of basketball relationship with any number of stars around the league. Good fits come naturally when a scorer of George’s caliber doubles as an elite spot-up shooter. All sorts of lineups make sense when George can defend the best player across three positions. Any rotation can work when you know that George, who is perennially among the league leaders in minutes played, can handle a massive workload. If anything, George made the balance of playing between Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony look easier than it was. George’s greatest talent—among many—may be how easily he covers up the seams. — RMNew conference, new organization, new teammates, same Butler (22.2 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.9 APG). A stunning 2017 Draft-day trade to Minnesota placed the relentless 28-year-old wing in the savior role for a franchise that hadn’t made the postseason since 2004. He promptly delivered on the playoff mandate, earning his fourth All-Star selection in addition to All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive Second Team honors. In terms of measurable impact, few superstars have rivaled Butler in recent years: he ranked fourth in Real Plus-Minus, he played a leading role in lifting Minnesota’s offensive rating to fourth in the NBA, his presence on the court swung Minnesota’s net rating by a whopping 12.8 points, and his team nearly fell to pieces when he missed more than a month with a late-season knee injury.Butler, like Russell Westbrook, predicates his game on force of will. When he arrived in Minnesota, there was hope that he would pair with Andrew Wiggins to form one of the league’s top perimeter duos. Instead, the two wings emerged in sharp contrast: If Wiggins’s empty minutes were a watery broth, Butler’s were a chunky stew. Butler seeks out the heavy lifting, whether it’s drawing contact to force his way to the foul line, hawking the opposition’s best player, or taking control of the offense late in close games. His methods work—to a point. \\xa0With Butler on the court, the Timberwolves were tracking to the West’s No. 3 seed, going 37-22 (a 51-win clip). Without him, they went 10-13 (a 36-win pace) and certainly would have been lottery-bound.But turning over a franchise to Butler is a bargain with strings attached. His all-gas, no-brakes style of play has caused him to miss an average of 15 games over the past five years, and his biting impatience with his teammates has generated problematic headlines in Chicago and Minnesota. The former role player has completely rewired himself as an alpha scorer since his breakout 2014-15 season, but there are real questions about how far he can carry a team in the playoffs. Butler has advanced in the postseason just once since rising to stardom, and he will need to make it through the regular season unscathed from a health standpoint if he wants to win a series in the West.Comparing Butler and Paul George is annually one of this list’s toughest calls, given their quality two-way games and similar accomplishments. While Butler is a more effective No. 1 option thanks to his punishing style and playmaking ability, George is the superior outside shooter, fits more cleanly alongside star players as an elite No. 2, and has enjoyed better health. Ultimately, the quality of Butler’s minutes won out: he beat out George in PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP while playing a more central role in his team’s success. If Butler’s injury issues resurface, though, he will be headed for a tumble in next year’s rankings. — BGIt’s rare to see a player already in the running for Defensive Player of the Year developing at such a rapid rate. Embiid (22.9 PPG, 11.0 RPG, 3.2 APG) is a sponge. The nuances of professional play are still so new to him, yet instinct guides Embiid to positions of particular impact. He has a natural aptitude for rotation, which involves reading the floor and timing out plays as they progress. Opponents are terrified of him, which buys Embiid time; players take such a wide berth around him and use so many pump fakes that Embiid has a longer window than most to get where he needs to go. Even at this stage, he all but guarantees an elite defense. Imagine how good Embiid could be when he actually knows what he’s doing.It’s that trajectory that makes Embiid, who stands to improve more than any other player in our Top 10, so difficult to rank. Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo could add to their games, but not so much as a center with limited experienced in organized basketball set to play his third NBA season. There are still noticeable hitches in Embiid’s game that could be ironed out, from the way he deals with double teams to his gutsy shot selection\\xa0 his carelessness with the ball. Embiid is a thoroughly dominant work in progress, which should come as a terrifying prospect to the rest of the league. There are few players capable of credibly guarding Embiid as it is. Things could really take a turn as his play elevates; we’re not far from Eastern Conference contenders stocking some big-bodied “Embiid stopper” by necessity.The caveat to all this, of course, is Embiid’s health. We have yet to see him play more than 63 games in a season, which came in what was easily Embiid’s healthiest campaign to date. It helps his case that so many other top players (Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, and Jimmy Butler, in particular) tend to miss between 15 and 20 games on average. Their own injury histories work as an equalizer. There’s more worry with Embiid because of his size and the chronic nature of his injuries, but this lists forecasts for a single season based off the healthiest Embiid has ever been. Allow, at least, for the possibility that the Sixers can be cautious with Embiid and still have him in uniform for around 65 games. — RMThe implicit framing of the Top 100 is this: Who are the players who really matter in the games that matter most? Paul (18.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 7.9 APG) jumps near the top of the list—not because he happens to play for one of the best teams in the league, but because he’s exactly the kind of player you want involved when your season is on the line. Houston knows this well, having built a 3-2 series lead against the Warriors thanks to Paul’s gutsy play and then having dropped the last two games of the series in his absence. On the one hand, Paul’s tendency to pick up injuries clearly works against him. On the other, Paul is still operating at such an incredible level that some missed time is tolerable. You make do when a player is operating this close to an MVP level, even if he misses 24 games along the way.Paul earns this standing with the way he picks apart opponents. What a miserable thing it must be to step up, as a big man, against one of Paul’s pick-and-rolls. React to any of Paul’s feints and he’ll rock back into an easy mid-range jumper. Try to play it cool and he’ll drive past you, winding around the court in search of any vulnerability. Paul is such a high-level passer and defender that his one-on-one brilliance somehow went unnoticed. No more. Houston’s offense reached its historic heights in part because Paul can almost always get his, a genuine rarity among guards his size. Even though he plays alongside another great passer in James Harden, only 15% of Paul’s field goals last season were assisted.It was because of that creative strength that the Rockets could stagger the minutes of their two best players, overwhelming opponents with 48 minutes of offensive pressure. Paul’s approach is quite different than Harden’s, but he runs similar lineups to great effect. For one, he scored as much on a per-minute basis as at any point in his career—even while barely getting to the rim or the free throw line. More important is that Paul always seems to know which levers to pull for the best possible result. Houston’s system relies on Paul ability to generate offense for himself, but he’s always at his most comfortable orchestrating for others—guiding his teammates into scoring positions and mismatches that best fit the moment.There’s no real substitute for that level of situational awareness, which enables Paul to function effectively in any lineup and in any style. There is no matchup on earth that could play him off the court, or even make him a mark. Target Paul at your own risk. This is a guard who can hang with Kevin Durant on the block in a pinch, and who can go shimmy for shimmy with Steph Curry. No matter the challenge, Paul is game to compete. — RMNote: Westbrook’s rank was determined before the announcement of his most recent knee surgery.\\xa0Say what you will about Westbrook, but the man shows up. When his team’s season is on the brink, Westbrook will take every damn shot necessary to keep things afloat. While other players awkwardly feel out the dynamic of a playoff series, Westbrook charges in, forcing everyone on the court to respond to him. It’s almost incomprehensible that someone who drives as hard as Westbrook could be as healthy as he’s been prior to undergoing knee surgery this week. Durability is a skill in itself, and Westbrook—even as his legend grows—doesn’t get nearly enough credit for his availability in the wake of hard fouls, harder falls, and\\xa0freaking dents in the side of his face.Simply employing Westbrook gives a team an unquestionable identity. No superstar in the league brings such consistent effort; although there are plenty of faults to find in Westbrook’s approach, you could never accuse him of coasting. Teammates tend to follow suit, giving the entire outfit a relentless, combative style. If you’re not ready to play, Westbrook will run you off the court. It’s perfectly understandable why some stars would pace themselves for the playoffs, though there’s value in a player like Westbrook bringing force to every game of the regular season.There remains some debate, however, as to what far-reaching effects Westbrook’s style might have on a roster. For any one player to dominate so many of his team’s possessions must come at a cost. Westbrook is similar to LeBron in that way. Playing alongside either can be a great gig for a specialist. The more narrow your game, the more Westbrook can do for you. Dynamic players, however, don’t always have the easiest time fitting in. Westbrook takes up so much oxygen that he makes it hard for other players to really blossom. It’s not exactly a coincidence that the Thunder never really seem to know how to function without him. Westbrook is such a force of game and personality that he becomes completely integral. If his team struggles without him, it’s in part because he made it that way.The good with Westbrook far outweighs the bad, but with his style comes a certain ceiling. Playoff teams can turn his ferocity against him. Defense still seems like an exhibition to Westbrook, a battle between players rather than teams. Patience—the primary currency of postseason problem solving—isn’t exactly his strong suit. And it’s all because Westbrook, for better or worse, only knows one way to play. — RMIt’s easy to get distracted by Milwaukee's lack of playoff progress or lose sight of the big picture after watching his impossible highlights for three years, so here’s a simple, zoomed-out reminder: Antetokounmpo (26.9 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG) is the best story in basketball. At 18, he was a nobody whose Greek league games were captured only on grainy video. At 19, he was drafted outside the lottery and spent his rookie season looking lost. By 22, he had cracked the All-Star and All-NBA teams and was named Most Improved Player. Now, at 23, Antetokounmpo is a certified global sensation, finishing sixth in 2018 MVP voting, drawing nearly as many All-Star votes as LeBron James, earning a signature shoe deal from Nike, and getting the full feature treatment from 60 Minutes.The longer one marinates on Antetokounmpo’s impossible rise, the more it feels like he’s won the NBA version of Powerball four times in a row. There is one major difference: Antetokounmpo’s extreme good fortune has been supplemented by extreme diligence to his craft. Step by step, Antetokounmpo has built himself into an alpha scorer by honing his ball-handling skills, committing to an attack mentality, living on the free-throw line, learning how to use his length to generate high-quality looks around the basket, and adding strength so that he can finish over and through anyone in the league. Indeed, nearly half of Antetokounmpo’s shot attempts last season came from within three feet, and he finished more than 75% of them. “He’s impossible to guard,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said during the playoffs, with evident admiration and a shake of his head.It’s only going to get worse for Stevens and his fellow coaches. Antetokounmpo’s feel as a playmaker has room to improve, as does Milwaukee’s spacing around him. The Bucks ranked seventh in offense last season, and they have the potential to be a top-three unit during Antetokounmpo’s prime years if they can consistently surround him with four shooters and get him loose in the open court more often. Of course, there’s also the persistent hope that Antetokounmpo can extend his range, which at present includes a passable mid-range game and limited three-point proficiency. Antetokounmpo with a trustworthy jumper would be a whole new flavor of impossible.In both his offensive strengths and limitations, Antetokounmpo somewhat resembles the man behind him on this list, Russell Westbrook. Although the Thunder’s point guard has gaudier individual stats and significantly more playoff success, Antetokounmpo is the more complete player thanks to his defensive impact and versatility. At this point, Westbrook’s massive offensive role comes packaged with major compromises in consistency and discipline on the other end. Not so for Antetokounmpo, who switches comfortably through four positions, competes hard on the defensive glass, and contests shots in the basket area more effectively than many starting centers. The bet here is that Antetokounmpo’s sharp ascent will continue with a 2019 postseason breakthrough, turning what is now a tight debate between him and Westbrook into a much easier call by next September. — BGThere’s a case to be made for Davis (28.1 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.3 APG) as the third- or fourth-best player in the league, and it goes like this: No other player—not LeBron James, not Kevin Durant, not anyone—is so consistently dominant on both sides of the ball. Davis could win Defensive Player of the Year while leading the league in scoring. He could be the captain of a top-five offense, the anchor of a top-five defense, or both. We’re nearing the pantheon days of Davis’s career—the beginning of his entry as an all-time great player, beginning with his MVP candidacy in the season to come.The pushback is largely a matter of respecting accomplishment. Stephen Curry and James Harden not only have all the markers of elite play, but a deeper superstar body of work and the postseason receipts to validate it. You don’t wave off two of the best offensive players in NBA history just because Davis is better than he’s ever been. A certain level of respect is owed—particularly when both Curry and Harden do so much to make their teammates’ lives easier.If there is any slight against Davis, it’s that his position makes it hard for him to touch as many possessions as a player like Curry or Harden. Guards who can initiate offense will always be slightly more accessible. Passing gives both a direct means of influencing a play’s outcome, to say nothing of the gravity they exert idly. Davis doesn’t really have that in his game, and that’s fine; allowing others to handle the ball frees Davis of the responsibility, allowing him to instead use his speed to its greatest advantage. Opposing bigs are at a loss when they’re forced to chase Davis, a 6’10” gazelle, around staggered screens to contest his jumper. You can use Davis in all the ways you’d use a high-scoring wing, save that he also has the face-up game to rule the mid-post and the finishing ability to dominate out of the pick-and-roll. There is very little on a basketball court that Davis can’t do.Part of what makes Davis so widely useful is that his shots are so difficult to contest. There aren’t many players who can meet Davis at the rim and make any kind of difference. When he goes to the block, he can’t be pushed around. Davis is taller and stronger than most of the players who guard him, and he understands how to put space between himself and his defender. How can one even combat that? To guard Davis is, really, to be at his mercy. You could transplant his skill set to any roster in the league and find room for him to thrive. Any coach running any system could build its concepts around Davis. His stardom is situation agnostic, and completely undeniable. — RMThe signature moment of his first MVP campaign came in late-February, when Harden (30.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 8.8 APG) set up one of his trademark step-back threes with a between-the-legs dribble that sent Wesley Johnson to the floor. While the Clippers forward scrambled to collect his limbs like he had just lost a game of “Twister,” Harden paused, relaxed his shoulders, and spun the ball while looking at his latest helpless victim. His body language screamed: “What are you doing down there?” Harden then proceeded to drain the three to complete the most emasculating highlight of the season.Harden has been an All-NBA level player and one of the league’s premier scoring threats for years now, but last season saw the 29-year-old guard at his most diabolical. With a new superstar playmaking partner, shooters on all sides, and an excellent lob finisher in the middle, Harden had everything he needed to carve up defenses with his ultra-efficient diet of threes, free throws and lay-ups. He tortured defenders like Johnson in isolation with his methodical crossovers, alternating between his hop-back jumpers, gliding runners, whizzing crosscourt passes and soft-touch alley-oops.When the dust settled, Harden ranked first in scoring, first in PER, first in Win Shares, first in free throws made, first in three-pointers made, second in Real Plus-Minus, and second in WARP. He led the league with 11 40-point games, four 50-point games and a 60-point game. Meanwhile, his Rockets set a franchise-record with a league-best 65 wins, ranking first in point differential and second in offensive efficiency while missing their first Finals trip since 1995 by one win. That breadth of high-level achievement is only possible when a methodically-constructed machine has years to address its weaker links and fine-tune its output.A full and fair review of the Rockets’ 2018 postseason would note that they breezed through the Timberwolves and Jazz as Harden, who had three 40-point games in the postseason, and Chris Paul took turns wreaking havoc. Additionally, Houston gutted out a pair of tight wins over Golden State in the West finals, with Harden scoring 30 points on the road in Game 4 to right the ship after an ugly blowout.For most observers, though, those accomplishments—which represented clear progress from previous postseason runs—were easily forgotten in the wake of Houston’s disastrous Game 7 collapse. Harden’s critics now had “Houston missed 27 straight threes” to add next to “2-11 in Game 6 against San Antonio” and the other demerits on his uneven postseason résumé.Although their agonizing Game 7 meltdown was impossible to explain, Harden and the Rockets left this season with proof that their approach was good enough to win a title. They pushed the Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant Warriors much harder than any other playoff opponent had over the past two years, and Harden performed with greater ease, stability and effect against Golden State’s defense than he had in the 2015 West finals. LeBron James has a higher basketball IQ and displays greater consistency in the playoffs than Harden, Durant is a more complete two-way player, and Curry is one of the few stars in league history whose individual offense can translate to more efficient team play. Those three aside, Harden has fashioned himself into basketball’s most dangerous weapon. — BGYou know the standards with Curry (26.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 6.1 APG) are well and truly out of control when a 50-40-90 championship season is met with a collective yawn. This is just par for the course when you’re the superstar at the heart of one of the greatest teams of all time, not to mention the very reason for that team’s existence. Kevin Durant would not have come to the Warriors if not for Curry. It was the environment that Curry had helped foster that enticed Durant in the first place, and it was Curry’s willingness to accommodate Durant that sealed the deal. A dynastic team was born because Curry is exceptional even among superstars.When Curry has been on the court during the Steve Kerr era, the Warriors are 244-45 (.844)—a perpetual 69-win pace. That’s four straight years of winning more than players like Harden or Davis ever have, all while the Warriors shuffled through centers, retooled their bench, and dealt with Kerr’s extended absence. Curry isn’t solely responsible for that success, but he is driving it. One can develop a deep appreciation for Curry by watching how the Warriors play without him; there’s too much talent in Golden State for things to turn disastrous, but Curry’s absence reveals all the subtle ways in which he makes championship play look easy. For starters, even a well-drawn offense doesn’t have the same juice without Curry’s involvement. The other Warriors move and screen and pass, but in the end so many of their sets are split cuts and fury, signifying nothing.It’s Curry that takes a good thing and makes it special. Every action that Golden State runs comes with implicit threat of Curry’s three-point shooting. When he doesn’t have the ball in his hands, he’s curling in a way so that he could possibly receive it. Most defenses still don’t know what to do with themselves. You can try to deny him, but Curry is quick to set a screen whenever he feels cornered—a simple action that can immediately throw the defense into disarray. Should any other defender help to contain him, Golden State will reverse course to find the open man as quickly as possible. Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system, but again: it’s the particulars in Curry’s game that make it viable. The entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn’t need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation. — RMDuring the premiere of his new barbershop talk show, LeBron James marveled to Snoop Dogg about the rapper’s uncanny ability to maintain his popularity through reinvention for more than 20 years. That particular skill has eluded Durant (26.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 5.4 APG), James’s biggest on-court rival, even as the 29-year-old Warriors forward has reached the apex of his Hall of Fame career. Branded a snake and a bandwagoner for leaving Oklahoma City to join Golden State in 2016, Durant has struggled to shake those labels despite winning two titles, making two iconic three-pointers in the Finals, and claiming two Finals MVPs.Indeed, the relative ease of Durant’s two Finals victories over James has only hardened the resentment. Instead of receiving the relief and validation that rings usually convey to superstars, Durant can’t seem to escape the “asterisk” talk, Superteam envy, and accusations of sensitivity. He’s tried a little bit of everything—donating millions to charity, appearing in commercials for tech companies, criticizing the president, launching a YouTube channel, speaking candidly in multiple long-form podcast interviews, taking the high road by giving intentionally bland press conferences, forsaking the high road by responding directly to his critics and opponents on Twitter—and yet his image is as polarized as ever.This is all a terrible shame. Durant is playing the best basketball of his career and some of the best basketball the NBA has ever seen. Even as Golden State coasted through a lackluster regular season, Durant performed like an MVP candidate, placing in the top 10 by PER, Win Shares and WARP, nearly shooting 50/40/90 for the NBA’s No. 1 offense, and ranking fifth in blocks while garnering some early-season Defensive Player of the Year buzz. When Stephen Curry was sidelined due to injury, Durant ramped up his offensive initiation and playmaking duties. The results weren’t always pretty, but Golden State scored more than enough when it mattered, going 5-1 without Curry to open the postseason.In the West finals, Durant was cast as the scapegoat for Golden State’s choppy offensive execution, with critics blaming his isolation looks for interrupting Curry’s free-flowing style. This was a truly uncomfortable place to be—stuck between a beloved franchise icon and his adoring fanbase—yet Durant responded with 34 points in a Game 7 road win over Houston. The opportunity to get defensive, check out and pick a new team in free agency was right there on a platter in late May. Instead, he collected himself and eliminated James for the second straight June, scoring 43 points in a Game 3 road win and finishing off the sweep with his first career postseason triple-double. \\xa0The flak that rained down during the Rockets series resulted from two years of pent-up anger. Durant’s ball-stopping and off shooting nights were the first serious signs of vulnerability since the Hamptons 5 formed, and a Houston upset could have had cataclysmic off-season ramifications for Golden State. Durant brushed aside the growing mob by continuing to be the unguardable scoring machine he’s been for most of his career. The Rockets, who admitted to an “obsession” with the Warriors, had no chance at stopping him or even keeping him away from his favorite spots. They were left hoping Durant would miss. Same for the Cavaliers, who had even less of a chance given their weaker perimeter personnel.Sure, Durant on the Warriors is unfair. But Durant—with his determination, focus, length, smooth stroke, solid handle, high release point, deep range, hesi pull-up jimbos, well-honed fakes, ability to hit turnarounds over either shoulder, and killer late-game mentality—is unfair, period.For the sixth time in this list’s six-year history, Durant finished second to James. In truth, he did everything he needed to do to stake a strong claim to the No. 1 spot. James, thanks to a magnificent postseason run, just did everything he needed to do to hold Durant at bay one more time. — BGAs James (27.5 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 9.1 APG) has waded into political and social justice issues, expanded his philanthropic endeavors, launched a budding entertainment empire, and positioned himself as one of the country’s most visible fathers, he’s taken to wearing and sharing a new motto: “More than an athlete.” The 14-time All-Star and aspiring billionaire knows the financial and emotional power of catchy slogans and hashtags— from “Just do it” to “Strive for Greatness” to “Kid from Akron”—and this latest entry will serve him well as he prepares to shift out of his prime and grow his net worth in L.A.Make no mistake: James is more than an athlete, but he’s still the NBA’s most outstanding, most valuable and most awe-inspiring athlete. He shook the league by leaving the Cavaliers for a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers in July, he helped open a public school in his hometown, he will sell untold warehouses full of yellow No. 23 jerseys, and he will dominate headlines, magazine covers and trending topics all season long. But when the term “celebrity athlete” is used to describe him, the emphasis should remain on the second word rather than the first. His immense basketball intelligence, extraordinary skill, unprecedented longevity as an elite player, and capacity for raising his game in the postseason and in late-game moments demand it.\\xa0\\xa0Basketball historians will look back in 20 years and lament the fact that James, now 33, has just four MVPs to show for his decade-plus of dominance. Last season was another potential MVP that got away; While James Harden was a worthy winner, James had a strong case too. He played all 82 games, led the league in minutes, and carried Cleveland to 50 wins despite two roster overhauls and multiple long-term injuries to his fellow starters. Individually, he ranked in the top-three in PER, Win Shares and WARP. Although he downshifted his night-to-night effort on defense, he was the determining factor between wins and losses as often as anyone in the game. James led Cleveland to a 30-15 record in games that were decided by five points or fewer in the final five minutes, and he ranked first league-wide in clutch points, second in clutch plus-minus, third in clutch assists, and fourth in clutch rebounds.Before a flat ending against a clearly superior opponent, James’s 2018 postseason was a mini-movie. He led the playoffs in PER, Win Shares, minutes, points, shots, free throws and assists, compiling averages of 34.0 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 9.0 APG. During 22 games, he tallied eight 40-point games, four triple-doubles, multiple buzzer-beating game-winners, his first full 48-minute playoff game since he was 21 years old, and the first 50-point game in the Finals since Michael Jordan in 1993.Those two months of basketball featured raw emotion when he jumped on the scorer’s table after drilling a three to beat the Pacers. They featured exquisite skill when he nailed a running banker to beat the Raptors. They featured remarkable will when he posted 35 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists on the road to outlast the Celtics in Game 7. And they featured perhaps the most visible agony of his career when his Game 1 for the ages was undone by J.R. Smith’s blunder.James tops this list, for the sixth time in its six-year history, because there’s no other active player who could match all the achievements listed above. And because there’s only one other basketball player in history who had the capacity to strike all the chords listed above. Like Michael Jordan before him, James the athlete will eventually be eclipsed by his own legend. But as he prepares to lead a new team of prospects and misfits in a fame-obsessed metropolis, it’s clear that time hasn’t yet come. — BGOver 50,000 students will have the opportunity to profit off their name, image and likeness (NIL) under a new Adidas initiative.Randle has more than $155,000 worth of fines from the NBA this campaign.Thursday's Sweet 16 Best Bets and Odds: Bank on Villanova and GonzagaVarious former World No. 1 players praised the Australian for her accomplishments in her career.The retired fighter received the charges based off an incident that occurred on Dec. 18.Who is the real transfer portal king in college football?

Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksAt long last, the moment (we hope) you\\'ve been waiting for has finally arrived: Our officially official ranking of the top 100 NBA players for the 2019-20 season is officially here. Officially.Before you journey down this rabbit hole with us, be sure to check out the position-by-position installments of our top-100 series if you haven\\'t already:Players are being evaluated relative to their performance for this season only. Benefit of the doubt is awarded to stars with limited appearances, but only if they\\'ve delivered at a high level during their time on the floor or seem likely to pick up steam in Disney World or during the potential Chicago bubble.Anyone who hasn\\'t logged at least 500 minutes is not eligible for inclusion. This makes for some tough cuts—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Klay Thompson, etc.—but this is, in essence, a 2019-20 retrospective. Sample size has to matter.Disagreements are inevitable. Which is fine. Friends argue sometimes. Just know that we didn\\'t assemble this pecking order to upset you. Any villainy you detect is unintentional*.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0*For the most part.If not for injuries that limited their availability or cost them the entire season, each of these players would\\'ve received top-100 consideration:Cheer up, sadz-havers. And angry-pants-wearers.Steph is a top-five player in any normal season. KD will default to no lower than a top-10 player post-Achilles injury until proven otherwise. And pretty much everyone else on this list, with the exception of Bagley and Kennard, are 2020-21 preseason top-100 shoo-ins, barring any setbacks.These players were tough to leave off, and we very much hate ourselves:100. Donte DiVincenzo, Milwaukee BucksDonte DiVincenzo\\'s basic numbers won\\'t burn up your screen, but his impact on the powerhouse Milwaukee Bucks is clear.On the season, Milwaukee is plus-15.0 points per 100 possessions when Giannis Antetokounmpo plays with DiVincenzo and plus-12.3 when he doesn\\'t.The reason for that uptick is DiVincenzo\\'s gap-filling game. He does a little bit of everything, as evidenced by his 7.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.0 steals per 75 possessions.And while his 34.4 three-point percentage could use some work, his 57.0 true shooting percentage was above average thanks to his ability to finish inside.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa099. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersIn his first season with the Indiana Pacers, T.J. Warren has quickly established himself as perhaps the team\\'s best scorer. In the rawest sense, his team-leading 18.7 points per game would suggest as much, though Domantas Sabonis\\' 18.5 aren\\'t far behind. They\\'re within a point of each other in the\\xa0percentage of makes that are assisted, as well.What sets Warren apart, though, is his ability to both spread the floor (37.5 percent on 3.0 three-point attempts per game) and run some pick-and-roll. Nearly a fifth of his possessions come as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, and he\\'s scoring at an above-average clip out of that play type.He still leaves plenty to be desired on the defensive end, but for a team that has been missing Victor Oladipo for most of the season, that from-scratch offense is valuable.\\xa0\\xa098. Derrick White, San Antonio SpursLineup politics have capped Derrick White\\'s crack at appreciable progress. Dejounte Murray\\'s return has relegated him to the bench, and San Antonio\\'s quasi-refusal to play the two together comes at the expense of his minutes.White is not blameless in this dilemma. Like Murray and DeMar DeRozan, he is a limited weapon from distance. Playing all three at the same time is a non-option for an offense that already traffics in cluttered floor spacing. White has, however, shown the set touch necessary to warrant minutes beside Murray on an alternative, DeRozan-less version of the Spurs.More than 20 percent of his looks come as catch-and-fire threes, on which he\\'s shooting 37.5 percent. Defenses are slightly less inclined to go under him in pick-and-rolls than they are Murray, and he\\'s canning more than 50 percent of his twos despite seeing his efficiency drop around the rim.Even the most marginal offensive upticks moving forward would prove massive for White. He plays a brand of defense you feel while watching. His stands against superstar guards and wings are enviable—a tutorial in staying ahead of ball-handlers and not biting on fakes—and he blocks way more shots than any guard standing 6\\'4\" with unimpressive length should.\\xa0\\xa097. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatThe easiest gripe to make about Duncan Robinson is that he doesn\\'t do much at a high level beyond shoot. Well, when you shoot like\\xa0this, that\\'s not much of a gripe.Stephen Curry (2015-16) and Steve Novak (2011-12) are the only players in league history who have matched or exceeded Robinson\\'s 2019-20 marks for volume (10.2 attempts per 75 possessions) and efficiency (44.8 percent) from three.Among players who have taken at least 500 shots from anywhere in a season, Robinson\\'s otherworldly 66.5 effective field-goal percentage trails only a bunch of All-Star centers and 2014-15 Kyle Korver.He\\'s been a flamethrower this season, and the Miami Heat have legitimately fallen apart when he isn\\'t out there spacing the floor. They\\'ve been\\xa0plus-8.8 points per 100 possessions when he\\'s played and minus-4.9 when he sits, giving him a 13.7 net rating swing that ranks in the 99th percentile.Even if he doesn\\'t dish out a ton of dimes or lock down the opposition\\'s best player, the impact driven by his shooting is immense.\\xa0 \\xa096. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsOn the other end of the equation is Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby, a solid offensive player who contributes the bulk of his value on the defensive end.All season, Anunoby has been willing and able to spend time on the opposition\\'s top offensive players. And Toronto\\'s defense ranks in the 84th percentile when he\\'s on the floor. His length, athleticism and switchability are reminiscent of some of the game\\'s top defenders, which makes sense given his standout habits.\"Ron Artest, Scottie Pippen, Kawhi [Leonard], guys like that,\" Anunoby told reporters when asked who he patterns his defense after earlier this season. \"Draymond [Green].\"Those are ambitious targets, but Anunoby possesses the tools to get there, at least on the defensive end.Whether he can carry a bigger load offensively remains to be seen, but simply maintaining his three-point shooting from this season (38.1 percent on 3.4 attempts per game) would make him a prototypical three-and-D specialist.95. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsContinued on-again, off-again availability is not the lone anchor holding down Caris LeVert. A right thumb kept him sidelined for two months, which doesn\\'t help, but his elevated usage has coincided with a steep drop in efficiency.LeVert is shooting under 43 percent inside the arc while both reaching and finishing at the rim on a lower clip. Mid-range jumpers account for a larger share of his shot attempts, and he\\'s not hitting nearly enough of them (35 percent) to justify the outsized share.The context of LeVert\\'s role is his saving grace. Brooklyn\\'s free-agency coup last summer has not translated to a tinier workload. Kevin Durant hasn\\'t yet debuted for the Nets, and Kyrie Irving has missed most of the year. LeVert is still charged with a healthy amount of from-scratch creation, and he\\'s holding his own.His effective field-goal percentage on pull-up jumpers (50.8) is higher than that from Jayson Tatum (50.3). His efficiency on unassisted threes is absurd. Among everyone launching at least three pull-up triples per game, no one touches LeVert\\'s 41.5 percent success rate.That he\\'s officially a trusted decision-maker out of the pick-and-roll props up his argument even more. He is one of six non-point guards clearing 17 points and four assists per game while draining more than 38 percent of his threes—evidence not of a breakout season but of his potential as a No. 3 on what the Nets hope will soon be a really good team.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa094. Davis Bertans, Washington WizardsDavis Bertans doesn\\'t do a whole lot on offense besides catch the basketball and shoot it. But when you\\'re as good at that one thing (which happens to be the most important skill in basketball) as Bertans is, you don\\'t need to do much more.Unleashed after three seasons in a much smaller role with the San Antonio Spurs, Bertans is averaging 15.4 points and 3.7 threes this season while shooting 42.4 percent from deep. Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who has matched or exceeded all three marks for a season (and he has done so\\xa0twice).Those threes aren\\'t garden-variety catch-and-shoots, either.\\xa0His 45 makes from 28 feet and out trail only Damian Lillard, Trae Young and James Harden. And his percentage from that range (49.5) comfortably tops those three.Extend the range to 30-plus feet and Bertans trails only Lillard and Young. But here\\'s the real kicker: He is an outrageous 18-of-26 (69.2 percent) on those shots.When defenses have to pay attention to a big that far from the hoop, it expands the floor for everyone else. On the season, the Washington Wizards have scored 121.7 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile) when Bertans shares the floor with Bradley Beal.\\xa0They have scored 106.2 points per 100 possessions (19th percentile) when Beal is on the floor without Bertans.\\xa0\\xa093. Danny Green, Los Angeles LakersThough he hasn\\'t been quite the impact juggernaut he was in 2018-19 when the Toronto Raptors\\' net rating was 17.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor, Danny Green has still been a clear positive for the Los Angeles Lakers.And of course, that impact once again comes from far more than scoring. Among the 147 players in NBA history with a 2.0-plus box plus/minus, Green is 136th in points per possession.In 2019-20, he\\'s done all the same things that have carried that value throughout his career. He spreads the floor, hits threes at an above-average rate and is capable of bothering the top perimeter option from about any opponent.\\xa0\\xa092. Marcus Morris Sr., Los Angeles ClippersMarcus Morris Sr.\\'s final placement is a tale of two seasons. Free rein with the New York Knicks gave him a certain je ne sais quoi. The numbers were pretty, but they came on a bad team, in a role he would never hold with a better squad.Joining the Clippers, a real title contender, may be a more accurate gauge of his value. That doesn\\'t bode well for him if the season is over. He\\'s shooting 28.3 percent from beyond the arc and has seen his usage rate crater amid a much more talented offensive hierarchy.Judge his season in its totality and Morris still comes out on top. He\\'s downing 38.3 percent of his pull-up treys and averaging a personal-best 19.9 points per 36 minutes on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. The question, as ever, is whether his offensive utility can spill over to a niche role in which he\\'s predominantly a spot-up guy and only situationally tasked with creating off the dribble. His usefulness waxed and waned under similar circumstances in Boston last season, and nothing has changed in Los Angeles, where 75 percent of his made buckets are coming off assists.91. Mitchell Robinson, New York KnicksMitchell Robinson is a lean, mean, shot-blocking and rim-running machine who may be on track to becoming a more athletic Tyson Chandler.He\\'s one of three players in NBA history to start his career with a 9.0-plus block percentage through his first two seasons, and his true shooting percentage is over\\xa020\\xa0points higher than the other two.Sure, he\\'s occasionally caught out of position and sometimes chases blocks at the expense of the scheme or a rebound, but he just turned 22. There is plenty of time for him to learn the nuance of NBA defense.At this age, the absurd production—14.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per 75 possessions for his career—deserves far more credit than the shortcomings.90. Marc Gasol, Toronto RaptorsMarc Gasol has posted career-low averages in points (7.6), rebounds (6.3), blocks (0.9) and two-point percentage (44.0) this season, but his impact has been an overwhelming plus because of the way he has embraced his new role on the defending champion Toronto Raptors.Over half (53.8 percent, to be exact) of Gasol\\'s attempts have been threes this season, a mark that is over 20 points higher than his previous career high of 31.4 percent from 2018-19. And he\\'s converted 40.2 percent of those attempts.Having a 5 who forces the opposition\\'s bigs to leave the paint does wonders for players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam, who still do plenty of damage as slashers.And though his raw block numbers are down, Gasol remains an effective deterrent inside. The Raptors have surrendered 6.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. What he\\'s lost in athleticism, Gasol mostly makes up for with IQ. His rotations are always on point, and he\\'s game for whatever scheme head coach Nick Nurse wants to deploy.His more focused three-and-D role has led to a plus-7.5 net rating swing that leads Toronto in 2019-20.\\xa0 \\xa089. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksIt\\'s hard to blame the Houston Rockets for moving on from Clint Capela. Two non-shooters in that offensive system just wasn\\'t sustainable, and the investment the team made to get Russell Westbrook meant he wasn\\'t going anywhere.So, Clint Capela was dealt, and the Rockets went all-in on micro-ball.We haven\\'t gotten a chance to see how Capela will fit on the Atlanta Hawks with Trae Young and John Collins, but there\\'s reason to believe it will work.Capela is an elite roller and lob finisher who has still averaged 13.9 points, 13.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 32.8 minutes per game this season. And Young is already one of the game\\'s best pick-and-roll passers. Capela should continue to get plenty of wide-open dunks set up by his point man.The only sticking point on offense is that Collins already does a lot of that. His expanding perimeter game could loosen things up, but there\\'s some potential for crowding.Capela\\'s real value to Atlanta may come on the defensive end. The Hawks are\\xa028th in points allowed per 100 possessions this season, and every defense Capela has anchored has been above-average.\\xa0\\xa088. Andre Drummond Cleveland CavaliersNothing crystallized Andre Drummond\\'s decline quite like the trade the Detroit Pistons brokered to unload him this season.They sent him to the Cleveland Cavaliers for John Henson and Brandon Knight (neither of whom were staples of Cleveland\\'s rotation), as well as a second-round pick.\"They dumped him,\" The Action Network\\'s Matt Moore wrote at the time. \"They straight up dumped Andre Drummond. They put Drummond out there like you did with your futon when you were moving out of your college apartment after graduation.\"The ability to avoid Drummond\\'s next contract appears to be the motivating factor of the deal. He\\'s shown better passing chops in recent years, but he\\'s still way behind the curve in terms of the skills expected of bigs these days.Still, Drummond is one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history. And just last season, he posted a plus-11.4 net rating swing. If the passing is here to stay, he can still be helpful. But it will be interesting to see how teams gauge his value this offseason (assuming he opts out).\\xa0\\xa087. Hassan Whiteside, Portland Trail BlazersThe change of scenery has revitalized Hassan Whiteside. He has registered his best box plus/minus since 2015-16, as well as career highs in both offensive box plus/minus and true shooting percentage.His plus-10.5 net rating swing is, by far, the best he\\'s ever posted. Now, some will quickly point out how many minutes Whiteside has spent with Damian Lillard, and that\\'s fair. But Whiteside has helped the superstar point guard, too.In addition to his 16.3 points, 14.2 rebounds and league-leading 3.1 blocks in just 31.3 minutes per game, Portland has outscored opponents by 3.6 points per 100 possessions when Whiteside has been on the floor with Lillard.\\xa0When Lillard has been on the floor without Whiteside, the Blazers have been outscored by 3.2 points per 100 possessions.\\xa0\\xa086. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersHuman bucket Lou Williams will be torching twine long after he files for social security. The aesthetics of his offense are timeless: Give him room and watch him barbecue defenders with an endless array of fakes, wide crossovers, scoop layups, nonchalant-looking pull-up jumpers and floaters.\\xa0Little about Williams changes from year to year, including this one. His game wants for a smidgen more efficiency, and he still gives zero Fs about playing defense, but his pick-and-roll and scoring artistry dazzle in perpetuity.Lowering his rank relative to the preseason is mostly a matter of splitting hairs. The margin of separation is so, so very thin outside the top 35.Williams\\' slight reduction in prominence accounts for the difference. As the talent around him has increased, his\\xa0scoring output\\xa0per 36 minutes and\\xa0crunch-time usage\\xa0have fallen from last year\\'s watermarks. Los Angeles\\' offense is likewise\\xa0less of a powerhouse\\xa0when Williams runs the show without another primary option on the court—a stark departure from\\xa0last year\\'s performance.85. Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn NetsDeAndre Jordan\\'s arrival never portended anything good for Jarrett Allen. Could he improve and endear himself to the long-term future of the Nets with a Kevin Durant- and Kyrie Irving-approved addition behind him?The answer is, predictably, complicated.Allen\\'s minutes are down, and Jordan was immediately inserted into the starting five following head coach Kenny Atkinson\\'s departure. This development is troubling for obvious reasons. Allen\\'s strengths are Jordan\\'s strengths—screen-setting, rim-running, paint protection—only he\\'s younger and better in a few, if not all, of their shared areas of expertise.\\xa0More troubling, though, is Allen\\'s lack of development elsewhere. His three-point experiment is done, and he doesn\\'t have any self-sustenance to his arsenal. After converting\\xa044.9 percent\\xa0of his hook shots last season, he\\'s down to\\xa040.9 percent\\xa0now.Jordan doesn\\'t have a broader reach, but he is the better passer. And whereas Allen can vanish on occasion, Jordan is more of an offensive constant.This doesn\\'t make DJ the superior player overall. He doesn\\'t crack our top 100 for a reason. Allen is the far more portable defender of the two. He may get outmuscled down low, but he has the side-to-side amble to neutralize threats in space. All of that said, Allen is clinging to top-100 status himself. That won\\'t change unless he improves in the areas he has control over—specifically the depth of his offensive bag.\\xa0 \\xa084. Robert Covington, Houston RocketsLast year\\'s right knee injury may have stolen a morsel of Robert Covington\\'s defensive inevitability, but that\\'s it. He is still one of the league\\'s most versatile and committed stoppers with an approach that exists in service of the entire team.Transitioning into a full-time power forward who moonlights at center (since arriving in Houston) has looked good on him. His rebounding is up to the task, and the Rockets are at their stingiest when he partners with P.J. Tucker on the frontline.Finite offense will always prevent Covington from being viewed in a more esteemed light. What few shots he takes inside the arc tend to come at the rim, an ideal profile for someone who works exclusively without the ball.But when your value is so soundly married to your floor-spacing, a below-average long-range clip—34.9 percent for the year; 35.7 percent in Houston—doesn\\'t quite wow. And though Covington makes up some of that gap in transition, his offense is overdue for another postseason test before he can vault closer to top-50 territory.\\xa0\\xa083. Kelly Oubre Jr., Phoenix SunsThe 2019-20 campaign has marked a breakout for 24-year-old Kelly Oubre Jr. He\\'s raised his scoring average in each of his five NBA seasons, peaking at 18.7 with the Phoenix Suns.His three-point percentage (35.2) is just shy of the league average on a steady diet of 5.5 attempts per game.And even with those marks on the offensive side of the floor, Oubre\\'s greatest value may be derived from his defensive ability. His length and athleticism allow him to cover multiple positions. His tenacity\\xa0leads to being second on the team in rebounds per game (6.4) and first in total rebounds.Overall,\\xa0the Suns\\' defensive rating has been\\xa02.8 points per 100 possessions better when he\\'s on the floor, though the team still defends at a below-average level. When he shares the floor with another switchy wing in Mikal Bridges, though, Phoenix\\'s defensive rating jumps to the 67th percentile.\\xa0\\xa082. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersIndiana underutilizes Myles Turner at the offensive end. He has the mobile handle to attack from face-up sets and is crafty enough in the post but is instead consigned to role-player duty. More than half of his shots are coming on\\xa0spot-up jumpers, and his touches are\\xa0way down\\xa0from\\xa0last season\\xa0even though he\\'s playing more minutes.That role simplification is equally necessary and unideal. Everyone has wanted Turner to up his three-point volume for the sake of easing the fit with Domantas Sabonis. He\\'s done that; a career-high\\xa044.3 percent\\xa0of his attempts are coming from beyond the arc.But he\\'s downing those looks, many of which are wide-open, at a 33.6 percent clip, and his timing without the ball needs work. Too many possessions end with him aimlessly occupying the same(ish) space as Sabonis.On the bright side, Turner\\'s defensive captaincy is steadfast. He doesn\\'t match up pound-for-pound with hulkier bigs, but he\\'s a pesky helper and rim deterrent. And while his workload on the perimeter varies by opponent, he has the\\xa0twitchy bendiness\\xa0to make dynamic creators sweat on switches.\\xa0\\xa081. Al Horford, Philadelphia 76ersFor years, the notion that Al Horford was playing out of position as a center for the Atlanta Hawks just sort of floated around the ether of NBA fandom. When finally moved to power forward, it became abundantly clear that he is indeed a 5.The 76ers have been\\xa0minus-2.4 points per 100 possessions with Horford at the 4 and plus-5.8 points per 100 possessions with him at the 5.This experiment may have made a bit more sense three or four years ago, but Horford\\'s age (34) and the continuing evolution toward positionless basketball have simply made him too slow and interior-oriented to play power forward.Yes, Horford has shown an ability to hit threes, though he\\'s at just 33.7 percent this season, but he still has a propensity to work inside. And it\\'s fair to wonder if his career-high volume from three has contributed to the decline in efficiency.When he\\'s been on the floor with Embiid and Ben Simmons, it\\'s simply been too congested inside the three-point line.He has played nearly 1,000 minutes at the 5, though, and he\\'s looked more like his old self there. In those alignments, he\\'s averaged 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions.80. Tim Hardaway Jr, Dallas MavericksThe 2019-20 season may be the best of Tim Hardaway Jr.\\'s career. He\\'s posting\\xa0career highs in threes per possession, three-point percentage, true shooting percentage and win shares per 48 minutes.The Dallas Mavericks have been\\xa0plus-12.7 points per 100 possessions (98th percentile) when Hardaway is on the floor with Luka Doncic and plus-5.0 when Luka is on the floor without Hardaway.Hardaway isn\\'t the only reason for that difference, but an elite floor-spacer, which is exactly what his 40.7 three-point percentage says he is this season, is what Dallas should surround Luka with.All year, when Luka has kicked it out or around the perimeter, Hardaway has been keyed in and ready to cast off. He\\'s\\xa0fifth in total catch-and-shoot points and has a 63.7 effective field-goal percentage on those shots.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa079. Evan Fournier, Orlando MagicFor a team that has a bottom-10 offense, Evan Fournier has been a life preserver. He and Nikola Vucevic are the only Orlando Magic players with above-average offensive box plus/minuses. He\\'s second on the team in scoring (18.8) and first in threes per game (2.7).And Fournier isn\\'t just a catch-and-shoot option, either. He\\'s done plenty of damage off the dribble. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul are the only players in the league who have matched or exceeded his field-goal attempts (352) and effective field-goal percentage (50.6) on pull-up attempts this season.\\xa0\\xa078. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsThe 2019-20 season has undoubtedly been a downturn for Draymond Green.\\xa0His per-game averages of 8.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.8 blocks still present a picture of a versatile point forward, but his efficiency has been abysmal.He\\'s shooting 46.5 percent from two-point range and 27.9 percent from three. His woeful 48.9 true shooting percentage is the worst mark he\\'s posted since his rookie campaign in 2012-13.Turns out, it helps to have Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson around.Still, Green\\'s all-around game has been a boon on a roster that has featured plenty of contributors who might have been in the G League under normal circumstances.When he\\'s been on the floor, the Golden State Warriors\\' net rating has been 4.2 points per 100 possessions better. Their effective field-goal percentage has gone up two points, which is a credit to his playmaking because his shooting certainly hasn\\'t provided that bump.And most impressive, the defense has actually been average and surrendered 5.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when Green has been on the floor.77. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzHe may be categorized as a small forward, but Joe Ingles has functionally been\\xa0the\\xa0point guard of the Utah Jazz\\'s Quin Snyder era.That\\'s tied largely to the fact that he\\'s been with the team as long as Snyder, but during this partnership, Ingles\\' 1,695 assists almost double No. 2 on the list. His assist percentage over the same span trails only Ricky Rubio and Trey Burke among all Jazz players.He\\'s gotten plenty of credit as a shooter over the course of his career, but Ingles\\' passing and feel for the game out of pick-and-rolls really drive his value.He\\'s generally been a solid perimeter defender, as well. He doesn\\'t possess the same vertical and lateral athleticism as other wings, but he has solid size (6\\'7\", 226 lbs), competes and is almost always in the right place on his rotations.Put it all together and it should be relatively easy to see why Ingles is having another high-impact season despite averaging just 9.8 points.\\xa0On the season, the Jazz have been\\xa0plus-5.9 points per 100 possessions with Ingles on the floor and minus-1.2 with him off.\\xa0\\xa076. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesYou\\'re in no way alone if Jaren Jackson Jr.\\'s sophomore effort hasn\\'t blown you away. His fouling and rebounding remain issues, and for all the positionless tools he sports, he doesn\\'t yet look the part of someone who can lock horns with opposing centers. Memphis allows 113.4 points per 100 possessions (34th percentile) and struggles to keep offenses away from the rim with him at the 5.Still, the Grizzlies have far worse outcomes than a version of Jackson that can\\'t sponge up heavy minutes at center. He has the lateral mobility to hang with contemporary 4s; this isn\\'t the San Antonio Spurs trying to prolong LaMarcus Aldridge\\'s time at power forward.It makes more sense to trumpet Jackson\\'s offensive progress. His three-point-attempt rate has\\xa0more than doubled from his rookie season while his efficiency spiked by nearly four percentage points. Only six other players who have logged at least 500 minutes are shooting as well from deep (39.7 percent) on eight-plus attempts per 36 minutes: Davis Bertans, Cameron Johnson, Danilo Gallinari, Paul George, Georges Niang and Karl-Anthony Towns.Jackson\\'s range and volume are supreme luxuries on the frontline. Letting so many threes rip is a sure-fire way to ensure he has no trouble playing power forward, and it opens up the floor for his guards. Concern for his defensive progress is fine, but his long-range touch—which he couples with a fair-weather ability to put the ball on the floor, albeit in slow motion—gives way to a matchup-proof quality that cannot be undersold.75. Jonathan Isaac, Orlando MagicJonathan Isaac would\\'ve earned much higher placement if not for a left knee injury that might end his season. Thirty-two appearances isn\\'t a lot, but it\\'s enough to reinforce that he—not Aaron Gordon, nor Markelle Fulz, nor Mo Bamba—is Orlando\\'s future.One-man defensive systems have that effect. Isaac is a hellfire draw for any big or wing. His length is ubiquitous in passing lanes, and he can simultaneously guard the big and ball-handler in pick-and-rolls.Getting off jumpers with him in the vicinity is a chore. He ranks in the top seven of both short and long mid-range shots despite missing more than half the season, according to PBP Stats. His length is equally imposing closer to the basket. Opponents are shooting 51.4 percent against him at the rim, a top-11 mark among 67 players challenging at least four point-blank looks per games.Future Defensive Player of the Year candidacy is absolutely in play, if not inevitable, for Isaac. The Magic need only be concerned about his offense. The odds of him developing a serviceable floor game are slim, and he doesn\\'t yet have enough spacing around him to get more bites as the roll man. If he doesn\\'t hone his three-point shot, then Isaac, like Orlando itself, will be up against an artificial ceiling.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa074. PJ Tucker, Houston RocketsHas PJ Tucker ever missed a corner three? Asking for a friend.Tucker is the player every contender—and wannabe contender—lusts after: a low-usage shooter and defensive tryhard with positional range that contradicts his size. It isn\\'t enough that he was already the Rockets\\' most valuable individual stopper on the wings. In the aftermath of Clint Capela\\'s injury and eventual departure, they\\'ve made Tucker their de facto center.Living up to that job description isn\\'t easy, period. It is an even more unreasonable ask for a 6\\'5\" 35-year-old who has made a career out of absorbing the toll attached to playing consistent, unyielding physical defense.And Tucker, for the record, is not some panacea in the middle. Houston\\'s defense ranks in the 34th percentile of points allowed per 100 possessions when he\\'s manning the middle. Sticking him next to Robert Covington has helped quite a bit, but there will always be a functional trade-off to playing sooo small, and it\\'ll usually manifest most on the glass.Nevertheless, Tucker\\'s value isn\\'t exclusively tied to defensive returns. It is more so grounded in the freedom he provides the Rockets. They are the best version of themselves because he can switch from chasing wings to rumbling with bigs. Russell Westbrook, in particular, probably never completes his midseason turnaround without Houston diving into microball—an option the team only ever had because of Tucker.\\xa0\\xa073. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicAaron Gordon\\'s offensive arc has unfolded like a career-long identity crisis. Is he a big? A wing? Can he shoot? Handle the ball?Definitive answers have yet to be provided—not flattering ones, anyway. Gordon\\'s role has varied. And while he\\'s still most likely best suited as a finisher out of the pick-and-roll and in transition, the Magic have steered him closer to the wing end of the spectrum. They have few alternatives and, thus, no choice.This isn\\'t always the best look for anyone involved. Gordon isn\\'t efficient on drives or when pulling up off the bounce. But he has started to find his way as a playmaker. Head coach Steve Clifford recently saddled him with more pick-and-roll initiation, and he\\'s responded by averaging 5.0 assists—and 8.3 potential assists—over his past 25 games.The Magic won\\'t soon trot out Gordon without another setup man. But his improving feel for facilitation diversifies an otherwise humdrum offense. And if his standstill three-point clip holds—39.3 percent over this 25-game stretch—Orlando will have one of the league\\'s hotter commodities on its hands: a playmaking defensive difference-maker with usable outside touch.\\xa0\\xa072. Christian Wood, Detroit PistonsThe temptation to vault Christian Wood higher is real\\xa0real. He epitomizes the in vogue center, someone who is a presence on the glass, swats the occasional shot, strokes triples and even puts the ball on the floor. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Serge Ibaka and Kristaps Porzingis are the only other players clearing 20 points, 10 rebounds, one block and one three-point make per 36 minutes.Sample size takes something away from Wood\\'s year in review, but not much. It isn\\'t his fault that Pistons head coach Dwane Casey stuck with Thon Maker for so long, or that he didn\\'t enter the starting lineup until after the Andre Drummond trade. That Wood\\'s per-game numbers since getting more burn have closely reflected his per-minute output is a big deal.Detroit will need to worry about its defense if he\\'s the man in the middle, though. Wood, an Early Bird free agent after this year, can cover a lot of ground, but he\\'s easily led astray off the ball, and opponents are unafraid to attack the basket when he\\'s jumping center.Offensive variety is still enough to get him by even if he doesn\\'t shore up his defense. He is at home squaring up for set triples, running into quick catch-and-launch looks, slipping to the baskets off screens, beating closeouts off the dribble and driving baseline. He has even flashed more advanced playmaking chops, increasing the frequency with which he finds shooters while on the move.\\xa0\\xa071. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles ClippersPatrick Beverley continues to be the gold standard for superstar cohorts. Few players are as universally translatable. Even fewer are point guards.Would it be nice if Beverley could negotiate half-court defenses with an off-the-dribble jumper? Or protect the ball better out of the pick-and-roll? Or finish a little more consistently, and frequently, at the rim? Without question. But there is serious value in someone who has lasted at a ball-dominating position by doing just the opposite.Over half of his\\xa0field-goal attempts\\xa0come as spot-up threes, which he\\'s converting at a nearly 40 percent clip. He can wreak a little havoc when attacking downhill but doesn\\'t command a predetermined number of touches or shots. He plays offense without ego.\\xa0It is quite the contrary at the other end.Beverley is a defensive workaholic, and he knows it. And he will let you know it, too. His reputation as a star-stopper neighbors on myth, but someone so emotionally invested in the outcome of every possession, whose motor will never be the least bit tied to his offensive usage, provides inestimable value.70. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursDejounte Murray\\'s return from a torn right ACL that cost him all of last season has not exactly unfurled according to plan. His strengths are as sturdy as ever. He is a terrifyingly talented rebounder for a guard and hasn\\'t lost a step on defense. The nights he does get torched are evidence only of the difficult assignments he draws.Things aren\\'t as rosy on the offensive end. Murray seems more comfortable putting up jumpers and is shooting well on long twos (47.0 percent) and threes (37.8 percent). But these looks come neither in volume nor haste. He needs time to get them off and still hasn\\'t aggressively plumbed his off-the-dribble jumper.San Antonio\\'s offense remains solvable when Murray is on the court. Defenses go under him, and he doesn\\'t have the speed to make them pay off the bounce or the nerve to uncork enough jumpers. He complicates matters with spotty playmaking. He has a tough time capitalizing on pick-and-roll coverage and turns the ball over a ton in transition.To what end Murray\\'s limited offensive growth falls on him is debatable. The Spurs\\' spacing is far from pristine, and DeMar DeRozan\\'s usage caps the influence he has over the team, both as a scorer and table-setter—not to mention his exposure to Derrick White.For now, at least, San Antonio can count his return as a win. Murray\\'s defensive nose remains intact, and better efficiency from the perimeter, even at minimal volume, isn\\'t nothing.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa069. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPrior to this season, Stephen Curry (four times) and Steve Novak were the only players in league history with seasons in which they matched or exceeded Buddy Hield\\'s 2019-20 marks for threes per 75 possessions (4.4) and three-point percentage (39.5).Even in today\\'s three-happy game, that kind of volume and efficiency generally isn\\'t found in the same player. Hield may be making a habit of it.On a roster as young as the Sacramento Kings\\', Hield has been a steady source of offense, particularly from behind the arc. The next step is getting to the line a bit more. But in the meantime, his shooting out of any situation makes him a dangerous weapon.This season, his effective field-goal percentage is\\xa060.4\\xa0on catch-and-shoot attempts and 50.1 on pull-ups.\\xa0\\xa068. Dennis Schroder, Oklahoma City ThunderDennis Schroder is having perhaps the best season of his career in 2019-20. He\\'s just a shade under his career-best\\xa0box plus/minus, but he\\'s easily cleared his career highs in effective field-goal percentage and threes per 75 possessions.He\\'s also been a key component in one of the game\\'s best lineups.\\xa0When the Oklahoma City Thunder have fielded their three-guard attack of Schroder, Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, they have outscored opponents by an eye-popping 31.4 points per 100 possessions, a net rating that ranks in the 100th percentile.And we\\'re not dealing with some minuscule sample here. That group has shared the floor for 850 possessions.They have managed to dominate opponents by exploiting a part of the floor many now ignore.\\xa0CP3, Schroder and SGA are first, 12th and 24th, respectively, in two-pointers made from 10 feet and out. And all three are shooting at least 44.8 percent from that range (CP3 and SGA are both over 50 percent).Schroder\\'s ability to beat his initial defender off the bounce and hit pull-ups before meeting the rim protector has done wonders for his efficiency, and his 6\\'8\" wingspan has allowed him to defend multiple positions in those guard-heavy lineups.\\xa0\\xa067. Jonas Valanciunas, Memphis GrizzliesJonas Valanciunas is navigating center\\'s new world order just fine. The three-point shot he\\'s tested over the past few seasons is a big part of it. He\\'s hitting 36.7 percent of his triples on a career-high 1.7 attempts per 36 minutes, allowing Memphis to leverage him as both a roller and popper.Barreling his way toward the hoop remains one of Valanciunas\\' greatest strengths. His screens stop players dead in their tracks, and he\\'s averaging a whopping 1.24 points per possession as the roll man (74th percentile).Defenders are still liable to look like puny humans when he goes to work down low. He is both hefty and handy: light on his feet, heavy with his shoulders. He\\'s one of 10 players shooting better than 50 percent on at least three post-ups per game.Merging the traditional with the neoteric wouldn\\'t mean much if Valanciunas couldn\\'t hang on defense. He can. He\\'s not matchup-proof, but his rotations around the basket are on point enough that he\\'s a net-plus back-line stopper when playing beside rangier 4s. Memphis has maintained an above-average defense in the time he\\'s spent next to Brandon Clarke or Jaren Jackson Jr.—nothing if not a ringing endorsement of Valanciunas\\' capacity to survive the ongoing frontcourt revolution.\\xa0\\xa066. Devonte\\' Graham, Charlotte HornetsDevonte\\' Graham is mission-critical to what the Hornets do. His off-the-dribble volume is the point of origin for everyone else\\'s opportunities. Charlotte\\'s offense opens up at all because defenses respect his pull-up jumper and the burst he shows going left.Efficiency is the cost of that import.Graham is shooting under 40 percent on twos overall and below 50 percent at the rim (11th percentile). His three-point clip has suffered after a strong start; he\\'s at\\xa033.3 percent\\xa0from beyond the arc since the middle of December. It is clear, often painfully so, that he\\'s being overstretched in his role. His is a game best deployed as a potent complement to an actual star. Charlotte has him running the whole damn show.Forgiving Graham\\'s struggles is relatively easy under these circumstances. His shots serve a purpose. The Hornets\\' offensive rating improves by 11.3 points per 100 possessions, and their effective field-goal percentage jumps by 4.3 points with him on the floor—impressively huge swings that both rank in the top six among all players who have cleared at least 500 minutes.65. Derrick Rose, Detroit PistonsInjuries have once again put a damper on Derrick Rose\\'s season—hip and ankle issues are the culprits this time—but not before he reestablished himself as one of the NBA\\'s most potent offensive weapons.Only seven players are averaging more downhill attacks per game, a feat made all the more impressive knowing he sees substantially fewer minutes than all of them. He will never draw fouls like he did at the beginning of his career—his takeoff origins are too inconsistent and often angling away from contact—but he\\'s shooting 64 percent around the rim (76th percentile).Most important of all, defenses are reacting to the results: 18.1 points and 5.6 assists per game.His three-point shot remains a wart, but his finishing at the basket and mid-range game command respect.\\xa0The disorder he creates on the move is Detroit\\'s shot-quality lifeline. Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players who have assisted on more corner threes, per PBP Stats, and the Pistons\\' offensive rating improves by 4.3 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (83rd percentile).\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa064. Bojan Bogdanovic, Utah JazzJoining the Utah Jazz has uncomplicated Bojan Bogdanovic\\'s offensive utility. They have him run the occasional pick-and-roll and mix in an iso here and there, but he otherwise exists to open up the floor and alleviate the burden placed upon Donovan Mitchell.Well, mission accomplished.Bogdanovic is one of six non-bigs averaging more than 20 points per game with a true shooting percentage above 60. His company: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton.Last year\\'s Indiana Pacers team leaned on Bogdanovic for from-scratch offense in the aftermath of Victor Oladipo\\'s ruptured right quad. Though he tackled the task admirably, that was always an overextension of his skill set. He is more in his wheelhouse with the Jazz as a play-finisher.More than 20 percent of his offensive possessions come as spot-ups, on which he owns an effective field-goal percentage of 58.4—a top-10 mark among everyone who has gotten off at least 200 field-goal attempts in these situations. He\\'s also shooting a rock-solid 45.4 percent on 9.1 drives per game.Occasional returns to self-creation separate Bogdanovic from other accessory scorers. He shouldn\\'t really be the focal point of any lineup, but he can get to his desired spots coming around screens and is putting in 39.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers.Utah\\'s playoff stock now needs Mike Conley to be Mike Conley more than ever. Bogdanovic underwent season-ending surgery to repair a right wrist injury, and without him, the Jazz are in the same predicament they found themselves in last year: absent a decided No. 2.\\xa0\\xa063. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersEvaluating Tobias Harris\\' season against the five-year, $180 million max deal he signed over the offseason would be unfair to him. He isn\\'t playing up to that contract, but the Sixers aren\\'t paying him to. Last year\\'s market gave him leverage. Philly\\'s still-mysterious breakup with Jimmy Butler gave him more.Harris actually has performed up to snuff following a rocky start to the year. He\\'s averaging 20.0 points and 3.1 points while swishing 39.1 percent of his threes since Nov. 15.For all the Sixers\\' offensive clumpiness, they\\'ve fared quite well when Harris sets up shop at power forward—lineup combinations they have at the same time fielded more than you think and not nearly enough. (Translation: What is Al Horford doing in Philly?) His defense has also been pleasantly solid, even relative to the less-squirmy assignments he pulls by seeing so much time between some combination of Josh Richardson, Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle.If Harris is guilty of anything, it\\'s of not being Jimmy Butler. He doesn\\'t foment the same defensive discord when working off the dribble and, by extension, cannot lug the burden of an entire half-court offense for long stretches or during crunch time. His job is made that much harder by the Sixers\\' wonky roster construction. That he\\'s not higher is on his limitations as a three-level scorer, and on Philly for not putting him in a better spot.\\xa0\\xa062. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsKitchen-sink metrics are love, love, loving Will Barton\\'s season. He grades out as a fringe top-50 player when looking at his average rank across six catch-alls. That clearly overestimates his impact, but it also isn\\'t flat-out egregious.Lineup composition accounts for some of Barton\\'s advanced-stat good fortune, particularly as it pertains to his defense.He keeps his fouls in check, and opponents have shot just 14-of-37 against him in isolation (38.0 percent), but Gary Harris usually spares him from covering the toughest wing assignment. And more than that, he\\'s constantly on the floor with the rest of the Denver Nuggets\\' best players. As Jared Dubin wrote for FiveThirtyEight in December:\"Barton contributes at a considerably above-average level across a wide variety of categories on both offense and defense, and crucially, he’s doing so almost exclusively in the context of really good lineups. He’s been on the floor for\\xa01,778 possessions\\xa0this season, per PBPStats.com, and of those possessions, he has had at least three of Denver’s four other regular starters alongside him for\\xa01,402 of them—a rate of 78.9 percent. That may not make Barton the eighth-\\'best\\' player in the NBA, but it does shed light on why a plus-minus statistic like RAPTOR thinks so highly of his contributions this season.\"The statistical dap Barton keeps receiving isn\\'t all due to convenience. He\\'s been huge for the Nuggets. After a right hip injury bilked much of his offensive mojo last season, he\\'s back to capitalizing on life as the third wheel to Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray.Way more of Barton\\'s looks are coming at the rim (35 percent) relative to 2018-19 (28 percent). His finishing around the basket isn\\'t great (41st percentile), and he doesn\\'t draw a ton of shooting fouls, but he\\'s a reliable playmaker off the ball. His 1.22 points per spot-up possession rank in the 90th percentile, and he\\'s converted 86.8 percent of his scoring opportunities off cuts (33-of-38). Denver can largely count on him to make the right pass when attacking closeouts.Doing a little in a lot of different areas adds up. Gordon Hayward, Brandon Ingram, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Karl-Anthony Towns are the only other players averaging over 15 points, three assists and six rebounds while knocking down at least 37 percent of their threes.\\xa0\\xa061. Ricky Rubio, Phoenix SunsRicky Rubio has lent a sense of two-way steadiness to the oft-wayward Suns. His inclination to push the ball keeps teammates hustling in transition, he\\'s one of the league\\'s best set passers, and Phoenix\\'s rollers and cutters work that much harder knowing he\\'ll find them. That he promises a measure of consistent backcourt defense is no less indispensable.Like always, though, Rubio\\'s limitations come back to haunt him. His three-point clip is actually benefiting from a late-season boom, but he remains a non-threat to score off the dribble.Dubious range and passive shot volume make it difficult for him to headline lineups without another primary option. Plopping him beside a cast of players with finite floor games themselves during those minutes only exacerbates the issue. The Suns are finding out firsthand. They rank in the 2nd percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he plays without Devin Booker.60. Derrick Favors, New Orleans PelicansDerrick Favors is easy to miss among bigs with more bedecked offensive tricks. His three-point volume and efficiency never took off, and mid-range jumpers have been almost entirely weeded out of his arsenal over the past two seasons. Playing him can come at an opportunity cost if the offense doesn\\'t have the spacing to milk his rolls to the basket or the flexibility to let him hunt second-chance points.New Orleans has done a nice job of establishing his fit, even when he plays with Zion Williamson at the 4. The team\\'s guards ceaselessly push the ball in transition, and putting pressure on the rim is of the utmost importance. And it works.The Pelicans are fortunate it does. They can\\'t afford not to play Favors. The same was true for the Utah Jazz. It would remain true if he were part of another team. His defensive presence is tone-setting. He is a back-line quarterback, and what he lacks in the fast-twitch department, he makes up for with court awareness.Targeting Favors on switches is seldom an effective ploy. He stays in front of ball-handlers, won\\'t bite on head-fakes and has the lateral gait to remain attached at the hip when they do put their heads down. It is no accident New Orleans went\\xa0from 26th in defensive efficiency through its first 25 games while Favors was dealing with injuries to\\xa0eighth since. Other players face tougher assignments—mainly on the wings—but he is the backbone that keeps the half-court integrity intact.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa059. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles ClippersRelentless is the word that best encapsulates Montrezl Harrell\\'s court presence. He is neither an exceptional rebounder nor rim protector, but his game knows only one gear: light speed.Harrell will out-talent few of his opponents. He\\'ll outwork almost all of them. His pick-and-roll synergy with Lou Williams is well-documented, but his finishing has more layers than that two-man connection. He will bruise his way to buckets in the post on one possession and then finagle his way to the basket, off the dribble, on the next.Someone who checks in at 6\\'7\" shouldn\\'t be so apt at getting through and over bigger opponents. Harrell merges force with finesse in a way defenses can\\'t quite contain. And the surety with which he carries himself—he isn\\'t shy about finishing plays while logging time beside superstars and primary ball-handlers galore—has secured his transition from a per-minute superhero to a higher-volume, per-game weapon.To wit: Antetokounmpo and Jokic are the only other players averaging more than 18 points while shooting better than 59 percent on twos. Harrell\\'s scoring opportunities are more elementary than theirs in the macro but no less overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa058. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksBrook Lopez is so much more than his missed wide-open threes. And make no mistake: He\\'s missing a bunch of wide-open threes. Among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 triples with a defender six or more feet away, his 29.2 percent clip ranks...124th.Volume and reputation help Lopez\\'s floor-spacing value. He has made threes at a higher rate in the past and takes enough of them that defenses are drawn outside the paint. He mitigates his shaky shooting even further by peppering in some nifty drives. He has the handle to get around opposing bigs without an up-fake, and the in-between touch to put down looks on the move.Post-ups also remain a reliable part of his bag. He\\'s averaging 1.08 points per possession in these situations (87th percentile). Functionally, then, he\\'s still a threat from all over the floor.Lopez\\'s defensive utility takes care of the rest. If he\\'s not matchup-proof, he\\'s pretty damn close. Where many of the switchiest bigs depend on side-to-side burst, he uses wide, low-to-the-ground stances.Smaller, quicker ball-handlers are hard-pressed to get around his length, and he is a case-specific virtuoso. The amount of space he leaves between face-up scorers varies by a player\\'s strength—his speed, his outside touch, his willingness to pull up off the dribble, etc.When being challenged by Lopez at the rim, opponents are shooting 46.9 percent—a top-three mark among 67 players who defend at least four such looks per game. Rival offenses are getting to the basket less and taking more of their shots from mid-range with him on the floor, a direct result of his capability in space.Demanding he receive Defensive Player of the Year consideration goes a touch too far, but over the past two seasons, Lopez has indeed entrenched himself as one of the league\\'s most impactful defenders.\\xa0\\xa057. Steven Adams, Oklahoma City ThunderSteven Adams doesn\\'t get the usage of old-school bigs, but everything else about him screams throwback.He\\'s resisted the three-point revolution. He\\'s a banger on the boards. And he doesn\\'t need credit for team success, even though the Oklahoma City Thunder\\'s net rating is 2.7 points better when he\\'s on the floor.His 10.9 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.1 blocks and 0.9 steals per game might sound modest, but that has at least a little to do with his playing time.\\xa0Per 75 possessions, he has produced 14.8 points, 12.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.2 steals. His 3.2 box plus/minus ranks 25th in the NBA, regardless of position.This is where advanced numbers come in handy. Adams, despite his lack of a jump shot and highlight-reel handles, has an impact on games as wide as his shoulders. He does a bit of everything. And his basketball IQ makes him an ideal gap-filler.\"I [don\\'t] think people know how smart he is,\" former teammate Enes Kanter said of Adams, per Forbes\\' Nick Crain. \"I think he is one of the most influential, educated and smart people. He is probably the smartest basketball player I have ever played with or against.\"Adams always appears to be in the right place on the defensive end. He\\'s a good roller in half-court sets, with a points-per-possession average that ranks in the 79th percentile on those plays, even without the top-of-the-backboard athleticism of players like Jarrett Allen or a prime DeAndre Jordan.He isn\\'t likely to threaten for an All-Star selection, but Adams may be this position\\'s quintessential glue guy.\\xa0\\xa056. Lonzo Ball, New Orleans PelicansPutting Lonzo Ball outside the top 50 feels wrong—not indefensible, but a little off. He turned a corner at the end of December and hasn\\'t looked back. His averages across that 31-game stretch: 14.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.5 assists and 1.6 steals, which he\\'s amassing while downing 41.0 percent of his threes.And yet, what Ball does for the Pelicans goes way beyond his numbers.He is their offensive intercessor, the playmaker most adept at negotiating everyone\\'s fit next to one another. New Orleans needs someone who defaults to pass-first alongside so many ball-handlers and questionable shooters. Ball keeps the transition attack humming and everyone else\\'s time of possession in proportion to the rest of the lineup.His significance is perhaps most telltale in the partnership he\\'s forged with Zion Williamson. Forget that Ball has assisted on almost one-third of the rookie\\'s baskets. The Pelicans seldom dare to play Zion without him. More than 73 percent of the possessions he\\'s logged have come beside Ball, the ideal intermediary for anyone who, as of now, isn\\'t in the business of creating his own shots beyond putbacks.55. Serge Ibaka, Toronto RaptorsThe evolution of Serge Ibaka probably tracks pretty close to that of the center position, generally. Over his first three seasons, he attempted just six threes.\\xa0Over his first six seasons, he averaged 0.7 three-point attempts and a league-leading 2.6 blocks.In 2019-20, Ibaka is averaging a career-high 16.0 points and hitting 39.8 percent of 3.3 three-point attempts per game. For the first time in his career, he has produced less than a block per game.Ibaka is a completely different player than he was at the outset of his career. And his ability to space the floor from the 5 opens up the paint for slashing from players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam.When all three are on the floor, the Raptors outscore opponents by 8.8 points per 100 possessions and post a defensive rating that ranks in the 92nd percentile.Ibaka is a more offensively oriented player than he was early in his career, but that doesn\\'t mean he can\\'t still defend. In those aforementioned lineups, he and Siakam are both able to cover the inside or switch onto smaller players on the perimeter. Their combined length helps to make up for the lack of size from a backcourt that includes the 6\\'0\" Lowry and 6\\'1\" Fred VanVleet.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa054. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsFew players embody the argument for advanced stats better than Marcus Smart. For the fifth time in six NBA seasons, he\\'s posting a below-average effective field-goal percentage. He\\'s putting up a career high in scoring, but 13.5 isn\\'t a number that leaps off the screen. Across the board, his basic numbers look relatively modest.But when you watch the Boston Celtics play, it\\'s abundantly clear that Smart is one of those \"does all the little things\" guys. He can reliably guard four positions (sometimes five, depending on the opponent). He never takes a play off. He makes smart reads as a playmaker. And he doesn\\'t demand a ton of touches on offense.That\\'s all been true in 2019-20. Boston\\'s net rating is\\xa00.5 points per 100 possessions better with Smart on the floor.\\xa0\\xa0 53. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeMar DeRozan\\'s net impact is under siege, even more so than it was last summer. His is a distressed value. He does everything deemed most important—initiating offense for both himself and others—but the terms of his engagement are so outmoded that they leave an imprint only under specific circumstances.The good remains really good.\\xa0DeRozan is an intuitive scorer and passer out of the pick-and-roll. He can still manipulate defenses with his change of pace, and teams usually fawn over No. 1 options forever under control.Just seven other players are averaging more than 20 points and five assists while matching DeRozan\\'s true shooting percentage, a list that mostly reads like a who\\'s who of top-25 stars: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Not all efficient offense is created equal, though. DeRozan is getting to the rim more often and ranks inside the 99th percentile of shooting foul percentage, but he\\'s still a blemish on his team\\'s spacing. Almost two-thirds of his field-goal attempts come from mid-range, and the San Antonio Spurs don\\'t even bother having him shoot threes.Star scorers deserve certain liberties. The mid-range isn\\'t dead so much as readily available only to a select few, DeRozan among them. He creates enough of his own shots and, this season, hits enough of his in-between looks to let them fly.Building an entire offense around someone who plays this way is still tough. Like three-pointers, mid-range jumpers are high-variance, but with a lower payoff. Living on them is a fragile existence. It is even more tenuous when a team doesn\\'t generate the spacing necessary to ensure those looks are of the best possible quality.DeRozan wrestled with the slimmest of margins until LaMarcus Aldridge started bombing more threes. And even since then, the Spurs have been 3.7 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor. (His defense is a problem.)Certain teams have the requisite shooting to optimize DeRozan. But to what end? Tailoring rosters around floor-raisers is always a nebulous venture, and as the gap between what DeRozan does best and what the league values most continues to widen, his ability to lift up a postseason contender will only wane.\\xa0\\xa0 52. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsPaul Millsap\\'s role is nowhere near what it was during his All-Star campaigns with the Atlanta Hawks. He\\'s 35 years old and playing 24.4 minutes per game (his lowest average since 2007-08). He is\\xa0fifth\\xa0among Denver Nuggets with 500-plus minutes in usage percentage.There\\'s no question he\\'s entered a role-player phase of his career, but he\\'s undoubtedly making the most of the playing time he gets.On the season, Denver is\\xa0plus-11.1\\xa0points per 100 possessions with Millsap on the floor and minus-1.4 with him off, giving him a 12.5-point net rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.He remains a Swiss Army knife of a defender who can bother multiple positions and rebound at a solid rate. And even alongside Nikola Jokic, he posts a solid assist rate for a big.Put everything together, and Millsap once again finds himself in a small club. Only\\xa0five players\\xa0match or exceed his marks for rebounding percentage, assist percentage, block percentage and steal percentage in 2019-20.Of course, those are rate stats, though. If anything is starting to go for Millsap, it\\'s durability. He only played 38 games in his first season in Denver. And he has had a difficult time staying on the floor this season.\"The biggest mark against him is the missed time,\"\\xa0Ryan Blackburn\\xa0wrote for Denver Stiffs. \"The starting power forward only played 41 of a possible 65 games, missing 21 on the season and 16 in a row at one point. That’s difficult for any team to overcome, and in a shortened season, missing roughly one out of every three games makes life difficult on the rest of the team.\"The Nuggets have played like legitimate title contenders when Millsap has been on the floor this season. He is the perfect gap filler in lineups with stars like Jokic and Jamal Murray. They just need him to fill those gaps in a few more games.\\xa0\\xa0 51. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersThe 2019-20 campaign has been something of a renaissance for Kevin Love. Last season, he appeared in just 22 games and posted his lowest box plus/minus since 2012-13.This season, he is averaging 17.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and a career-high 2.6 threes in just 31.8 minutes per game. Adjust those numbers for pace and playing time and they jump up to 20.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 3.0 threes per 75 possessions.And he has posted those numbers on a team generally dominated by guard play. Collin Sexton leads the team in usage, and Darius Garland and Kevin Porter are above 20 percent. Cleveland were\\xa022nd in potential assists when the season was suspended.That led to viral moments of frustration like this one, wherein he threw his arms up at Sexton during a possession, demanded the ball, then two-hand chucked it Cedi Osman before stomping toward halfcourt.In January, though, Love expressed remorse over this and other moments from a difficult season.\"I wasn\\'t acting like a 31-year-old, I was acting like a 13-year-old,\" Love told reporters. \"That was not me.\"He was the veteran presence the young Cavs needed from that practice on. Prior to that admission, he averaged 16.4 points. Afterward, he scored 19.0 per game.It remains to be seen whether that was enough to reinvigorate his trade value. Love\\'s current deal takes him through 2022-23, which will be his age-34 season. He\\'s set to make a whopping $91.5 million over those three years.That\\'s a huge commitment, but a team that fancies itself \"one piece away\" may look at the last few weeks of Love\\'s 2019-20 and think he\\'s the floor-spacing, solid-passing big who\\'ll put it over the top.After two decades of dominance, it\\'s been a rough couple of years for the San Antonio Spurs. But as long as LaMarcus Aldridge is on the floor, they still score.Since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, San Antonio has put up 116.3 points and outscored opponents by 2.0 points per 100 possessions when Aldridge plays without DeMar DeRozan\\xa0(the Spurs score 112.3 points per 100 possessions and are a minus-1.2 when both share the floor).When Aldridge is the focal point, the offense generally hums. And that especially became true after he fully embraced the three for the first time in his career.From Dec. 23 to the start of the hiatus, Aldridge averaged 4.2 three-point attempts per game and shot 41.6 percent from deep. Over the same stretch, the Spurs scored 115.4 points per 100 possessions with Aldridge on the floor and 111.3 with him off.Becoming a full-blown stretch 5 could add years to Aldridge\\'s career. In the right situation, this newfound willingness to spread the floor could make things easier for the rest of a lineup.Defensively, Aldridge is posting a career-high 1.6 blocks per game, but the Spurs are terrible on that end when he plays, regardless of whether he\\'s with DeRozan.On the season, San Antonio\\'s 113.4 points allowed per 100 possessions rank 24th in the NBA. And that mark gets worse\\xa0by 2.4 points\\xa0when Aldridge plays.Still, if he were surrounded by better perimeter defenders, there\\'s a world in which Aldridge is a very impactful modern 5.Being the No. 1 pick in a 2018 draft class that included Luka Doncic and Trae Young is a tough hand to be dealt. The chances that Deandre Ayton ever tops the hype surrounding either, especially Doncic, are slim. But if you just judge Ayton on his merits, he\\'s off to a heck of a start.After a 25-game suspension, he averaged 19.0 points, 12.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 33.2 minutes per game before the hiatus.\\xa0On the season, the Suns are plus-0.7 points per 100 possessions with Ayton on the floor and minus-2.9 with him off.His 57.1 true shooting percentage eclipsed the league average, but not by much. That\\'s likely the next frontier for Ayton. More trips to the line would help. A player with his size (6\\'11\", 250 lbs) and athleticism shouldn\\'t be averse to contact.He could use some work on defense, as well, but the Suns\\' defensive rating is better when he plays. And the nearly two blocks per game is nothing to sneeze at. Ayton is already a sturdier anchor than many projected he\\'d be by his second year, but he doesn\\'t strike fear into opposing slashers.Of course, for a sophomore, this is almost nitpicky. What Ayton\\'s done with the start of his career is unusual.\\xa0Tim Duncan, Blake Griffin, Shaquille O\\'Neal and Towns are the only players in league history to match or exceed his career averages for points (17.1) and rebounds (10.8) through an age-21 season.Malcolm Brogdon\\'s first season with the Indiana Pacers began with a wave of exceeded expectations. The dribble penetration that shone so bright with the Milwaukee Bucks was in full bloom, only it looked much more impressive coming amid skimpier spacing and at higher volume. He was hitting threes, unloading a spruced-up off-the-dribble two and dropping dimes to teammates against defenses he himself scrambled.Some of these good vibes have persisted.He\\'s hitting\\xa050.3 percent\\xa0of his pull-up twos for the season, and even as the speed at which he probes has gone down, his dribble drives continue to create opportunities for orbiting shooters and those hovering closer to the basket. But injuries have given way to inconsistency, and it can be tough to watch. As Indy Cornrows\\'\\xa0Caitlin Cooper\\xa0noted on the\\xa0Hardwood Knocks\\xa0podcast:\"His drives dropped quite a bit. His free-throw attempts bottomed out. His free-throw percentage dropped by a pretty big margin as well. And you noticed that he didn\\'t really look like he was moving super well on either end of the floor. He\\'s not a great point of attack to defender to begin with, but even when he was off the ball and had to help to the nail, he just looked stiff and brittle. Maybe this [quad] injury that he has, I don\\'t know if that was something that was bothering him before, or what was going on.\"But obviously, his three-point shot hasn\\'t necessarily carried over from Milwaukee either. He\\'s down in the low 30s overall, and he\\'s taking tougher threes—more pull-up threes and more contested threes as a product of no longer being a spot-up guy next to Giannis [Antetokounmpo] anymore. And [Victor] Oladipo isn\\'t really there to generate that type of gravity.\"Writing off Brogdon\\'s midseason spiral as the offshoot of injury woes is fair. Whiffing on contested, off-the-bounce three-pointers is one thing. Missing higher-quality looks is more problematic. Brogdon is finding nylon on just 31.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot triples and hitting\\xa0only 28.8 percent\\xa0of his wide-open long balls—the second-worst mark among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 uncontested threebies.Indiana needs him to knock down those looks to facilitate the fit with Oladipo. Brogdon\\'s hot start, responsibility within the Pacers offense and raw numbers (16.3 points 7.1 assists per game) are enough to float top-50 placement for now, but he\\'s primed for a decline if a cleaner bill of health doesn\\'t render him more of a constant.Jamal Murray is at the same time an offensive standout and a source of concern for the Denver Nuggets.Twenty-three-year-old point guards can play with his level of bravado, but few in his age bracket can parlay that bluster into substance. That Murray can transition so effectively from playing off Nikola Jokic to breaking down defenses in the half court is a functional virtue, and he has already shown he can turn the tides of a playoff game.The importance of his off-the-dribble jumper increases tenfold versus the stingiest defenses and during crunch time in general.Handing him the offensive keys without Jokic is still touch-and-go. The Nuggets place in the 46th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he runs solo—neither terrible nor average. This might say more about the lineups in which he plays during these stretches. Suboptimal spacing is a problem in many of the ancillary combinations.Denver needn\\'t place too much stock in these Jokic-less returns...yet. Maintaining an average offense without one of the game\\'s seven best offensive engines on the court is supposed to be a chore...for now. But these safety-net caveats won\\'t last forever.After signing a five-year max extension last July, Murray is about to be paid like a star. The Nuggets don\\'t have clear access to sustained title contention if he doesn\\'t turn into a comparable sidekick for Jokic. Murray has his moments, but those displays aren\\'t yet stasis. He too often disappears in the backdrop. At the very least, he hasn\\'t made an appreciable leap.Check out his per-36 splits over the past three seasons:Right down to his shot distribution, Murray looks eerily similar to the player of the past three seasons. And while that\\'s still good enough to scrap for a top-50 billing, a top-50 billing isn\\'t good enough for what Denver\\'s paying him to be.Spencer Dinwiddie\\'s field-goal percentage, three-point percentage and free-throw percentage have seen fairly significant declines this season.\\xa0Who knew that D\\'Angelo Russell was such a safety net?Still, the Brooklyn Nets muster just\\xa0102.5\\xa0points per 100 possessions when Dinwiddie is off the floor.\\xa0For context\\'s sake, the Golden State Warriors\\' league-worst offense scores\\xa0104.9\\xa0points per 100 possessions.When Dinwiddie is in the game, that number has jumped to 111.8, giving him an offensive rating swing that ranks in the 97th percentile.Despite the inefficiency on his own shots, Dinwiddie\\'s presence on the floor makes things easier for everyone else. He has commanded plenty of defensive attention as the No. 1 option for all but the 20 games Kyrie Irving played and is a willing passer when that attention overwhelms. His career-high 6.8 assists lead the team.Stephen Curry and James Harden are the only players in NBA history with seasons in which they\\'ve matched or exceeded D\\'Angelo Russell\\'s 2019-20 averages for assists (7.0) and threes (3.9) per 75 possessions.His ability to drag defenders well outside the three-point line opens things up for teammates with both the Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves. But it still feels like we\\'ve yet to see the fully realized Russell.Perhaps the pick-and-roll (or, more likely, pick-and-pop) game with he and Karl-Anthony Towns will do the trick. Sure, that same duo is a likely target for opponents on the other end of the floor, but it\\'ll be a nightmare to cover.Russell has a sub-50 effective field-goal percentage on shots off the dribble this season, but defenses aren\\'t able to load up on him when Towns is the one setting ball screens. And if the guard has his matchup on an island, he\\'ll do plenty of damage.Zach LaVine\\'s place relative to the rest of the league remains in flux. Someone who clears 25 points per game while nailing nearly 50 percent of his twos and 38 percent of his threes is clearly good, but the degree to which he can impact winning isn\\'t yet known.\\xa0Billing him as an empty-calories scorer is more than a touch too bold. LaVine\\'s numbers are not solely the offshoot of unchecked volume. He has meaningful layers to his game.Anyone who can reliably find nylon on off-the-bounce threes is an asset, and LaVine has drilled 36.4 percent of his pull-up triples on top-15 volume. Junky twos aren\\'t as prevalent in his offensive armory anymore, and he has appreciably increased his point-blank frequency over the past two seasons.Figuring out whether LaVine\\'s production elevates those around him is where things get tricky. He is fine as a complementary playmaker but overstretched as anything more. And his off-the-bounce triples, while impressive, often seem less necessary and more the result of over-dribbling.This wouldn\\'t matter if the Chicago Bulls were winning, or if LaVine guaranteed an average offense. They\\'re not, and he doesn\\'t.Chicago scores nearly four points more per 100 possessions with him on the court (80th percentile), but that jump is still only good for an offensive rating in the 28th percentile. LaVine isn\\'t Devin Booker or Trae Young, two lifelines on losing teams who redefine their offense\\'s ceiling. He\\'s more of a floor-preserver—the kind of player who\\'d be a lot better off as the Bulls\\' No. 2.Gordon Hayward has finally settled into a new normal following the devastating compound left leg fracture and dislocated left ankle he suffered on opening night of the 2017-18 season. He is both better and more consistent than he was last year, his comfort level perhaps most evident in the ease and frequency with which he dribbles into turnarounds and fadeways that require him to spin or stop on a dime.At the same time, Hayward is visibly different.This is not the might-be All-NBA candidate the Boston Celtics signed in 2017. He has never put a ton of pressure on the rim, but he\\'s at least slightly more reserved when attacking from advantageous positions in space. His presence at the foul line was on the modest end to begin with and has since been slashed. He\\'s averaging a career-low 2.7 free throws per 36 minutes.Moving beyond what Hayward was versus what he is now isn\\'t particularly hard. Boston has been unable to buy time on offense when he plays without Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker, and he\\'s on the books for superstar money, but his shift in status post-injury isn\\'t dire. He\\'s still an effective, efficient player.Hayward is shooting a remarkable 55.3 percent inside the arc, including 53.6 percent on pull-up two-pointers. He ranks in the 91st percentile of efficiency on spot-up possessions, which account for nearly 20 percent of his offense. When he does get to the rim, he\\'s converting at a 69.0 percent clip (89th percentile).The Celtics can\\'t expect him to carry entire lineups, but they can count on his two-man game with Daniel Theis, tidy drop-offs to shooters and wicked-fast post entry passes.Viewed in its totality, Hayward\\'s contribution falls well shy of stardom. His numbers—17.3 points and 4.1 assists per game with a\\xa059.3 true shooting percentage—put him in esteemed company, but neither his responsibility nor volume is the same. It may never be.That\\'s fine. Because if stardom is off the table, Hayward has already shown he can be the next best thing: high-end support for a championship contender.Fred VanVleet became a full-time starter this season, and he hasn\\'t disappointed. Beyond the career-high 17.6 points he\\'saveraging, he shot 38.8 percent from three on 7.0 attempts per game. His 6.6 assists per contest have made him one of the game\\'s top secondary creators as part of the Toronto Raptors\\' two-point-guard attack.But what really sets VanVleet apart from the point guards detailed above is his defense. Despite a listed height of just 6\\'0\", he manages to make life difficult for opposing 1s by seemingly setting up shop right under their dribble. It\\'s almost like the undersized boxer is working way inside the range of his taller opponent.When he\\'s on the floor, Toronto allows 105.9 points per 100 possessions, a mark that ranks in the 87th percentile. His in-your-face defense on opposing creators is a big reason why.Trae Young understandably gets the most attention of the young Atlanta Hawks, but it\\'s his budding partnership with John Collins that has the potential to make him a winning player.When Young is on the floor with Collins this season, Atlanta is minus-1.7 points per 100 possessions. When he is on the floor without Collins, that number plummets to minus-7.3.A big who can score from the inside and the three-point line is borderline essential in today\\'s NBA. And Collins is exactly that. Whether Young is quarterbacking a pick-and-roll or isolating, Collins is an ideal receiver.His points per possession as a roll man ranks in the 84th percentile this season. And he is shooting 42.5 percent on 3.3 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per game.Collins is much more than the 21.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and highlight-reel dunks you\\'ve seen of him. He has the potential to be a thoroughly modern 5 and half of one of the league\\'s best offensive duos.On the other end, Collins certainly isn\\'t bad, but he\\'s not the kind of dominant defender that can cover for the deficiencies of Young. Clint Capela may be that, and Collins is nimble enough to play the 4, but the ideal configuration may be Young, Collins and three switchy wing/forwards.However those lineups are aligned, Atlanta should feel confident that it already has the box checked for a big man with All-Star potential.Eric Bledsoe is one of the league\\'s best among point guards. After making first-team All-Defense in 2019, there is no slippage from him in 2019-20.On the season, the Milwaukee Bucks allow an era-defying 95.3 points per 100 possessions when Bledsoe shares the floor with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Their overall defense, which ranks first in the league by a\\xa0wide\\xa0margin, allows 102.3 points per 100 possessions.Like VanVleet, Bledsoe is undersized (6\\'1\") but unafraid to play in close quarters. With his lateral quickness, he can play a more aggressive brand of defense than most.And his offense isn\\'t too shabby, either. In fact, after a few years alongside the MVP-caliber Giannis, Bledsoe might be a bit underrated on that end. This season, he\\'s averaging 25.4 points and 7.4 assists per 75 possessions\\xa0with a 58.3 true shooting percentage when Giannis is off\\xa0the floor.It took him some time to find his basketball legs again, but once he did, Kristaps Porzingis has looked like the ideal big-man complement to Luka Doncic.He had averages of 19.2 points, a career-high 9.5 rebounds and a career-high 2.5 threes when the season was put on hiatus, but his 54.0 true shooting percentage was over two points below the league average.From Jan. 31 up to the suspension, though, he was at 25.2 points, 10.9 rebounds and 3.2 threes with a 60.5 true shooting percentage.After sitting out all of 2018-19 while recovering from a torn ACL, we probably should\\'ve expected the slow start, but even when the shots aren\\'t falling, you can see the stylistic fit.\"He\\'s throwing some really cool lob passes to [Dwight] Powell,\" coach Rick Carlisle told reporters in December. \"I mean, you\\'ve got a 7\\'3\" guy throwing to a 6\\'10\" guy on a lob? That\\'s pretty [expletive] cool if you ask me. Let\\'s get off of all this stuff that KP needs to go in the post. He doesn\\'t. He doesn\\'t. I\\'m OK with him going in there once in a while, but we don\\'t post anybody.\"Porzingis as a key cog in Dallas\\' Luka-run offense has worked wonders. The 116.7 points per 100 possessions the Mavericks have scored is an all-time high.But the bigger impact from KP may come on defense. His offensive rating swing is a near-neutral plus-0.1. But opponents score\\xa05.0 fewer points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor. He has a top-10 block percentage this season and leads all Mavs with at least 500 minutes in defensive rebounding rate.If he maintains that sort of defensive impact next season, while playing like he did in the first few months of 2020 on offense, the Mavericks will have one of the game\\'s top duos (if they don\\'t already).Danilo Gallinari is still better than people realize. He is in his\\xa0third\\xa0season of posting a 60-plus true shooting percentage, a 35-plus free-throw-attempt rate and a 40-plus three-point-attempt rate, and he\\'s\\xa0top 70\\xa0all time in career offensive box plus/minus. James Harden and Chauncey Billups are the only players with more such seasons.This distinctly modern game has been a staple for Gallinari for years, but it has been particularly effective alongside Chris Paul with the Oklahoma City Thunder. When the two vets share the floor, OKC score at a blistering rate of\\xa0120.1\\xa0points per 100 possessions (99th percentile).And while CP3 rightfully gets most of the praise for the Thunder\\'s better-than-expected attack—even Gallo\\xa0said, \"I think he\\'s the best leader that I\\'ve played with.\"—the Italian forward deserves plenty of credit.Paul spreads the ball around more than most floor generals, but Gallinari is still his\\xa0top\\xa0assist target.\\xa0And when CP3 plays without Gallo, that offense plummets to a below-average\\xa0109.3\\xa0points per 100 possessions.That impact has a lot to do with the shooting that forced defenders to watch him outside, but Gallinari brings a lot more offense to the table. His pump-fake-and-go game is top-tier. And he\\'s one of the game\\'s best at identifying disadvantaged defenses and actually moving into a drive\\xa0before\\xa0the catch. He\\'s not the most explosive athlete, so even those plays didn\\'t often end with wide-open layups, but he draws plenty of fouls that way. His uber-efficient attack is a critical part of the Thunder\\'s success.On the other end of the floor, he has a harder time overcoming his weaknesses. He\\'s often caught flat-footed on the perimeter. And he doesn\\'t rebound a ton, despite being 6\\'10\". Both contributed to opponents scoring\\xa08.0\\xa0more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, a defensive rating swing that ranks in the fifth percentile.But even with that deep of a hole dug defensively, Gallinari\\'s plus-6.6 net rating swing still ranks in the 85th percentile. That\\'s how much of an impact his offense makes.Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only player who matches or exceeds Nikola Vucevic\\'s averages for points (20.3), rebounds (11.6) and assists (3.8) over the last two seasons.Yes, that\\xa0Antetokounmpo. The reigning MVP with a good shot to join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.Of course, Antetokounmpo blows away the thresholds set by Vucevic, but the production is plenty impressive nonetheless.Like others on this list, Vucevic has improved his standing in the league by embracing the three-point shot and facilitating from the post. For the first six years of his career, he averaged 2.0 assists and 0.3 three-point attempts per game.\\xa0Over the last three, those numbers are up to 3.7 and 3.6.And his more evolved game has made him, by far, the most important player on the Orlando Magic.Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, Orlando is plus-1.3 points per 100 possessions with Vucevic on the floor and minus-5.3 with him off. The offensive rating takes a 6.2-point tumble when he sits.When he\\'s on the floor, Vooch commands defensive attention whether in the post or surveying the floor from up top. This, of course, makes things easier for teammates who\\'ve struggled to carry offensive responsibility throughout their careers.On the other end of the floor, Vucevic isn\\'t likely to threaten for Defensive Player of the Year anytime soon, but he\\'s done a solid job of piling up counting stats as a member of the Magic. There are only seven players who match or exceed his totals for blocks and steals since he went to Orlando in 2012. And he\\'s had an above-average defensive-rating swing in three of his last four seasons.One of the key differences between Bledsoe and De\\'Aaron Fox is that the former has the luxury of playing over two-thirds of his total minutes alongside an MVP. His burden is significantly lighter than Fox\\'s, a third-year guard tasked with engineering the offense of a team without an All-Star.Even with the heavy load and an early-season injury that cost him 17 straight games, though, Fox has maintained his career\\'s upward trajectory.\\xa0He\\'s averaging 20.4 points and 6.8 assists in just 31.7 minutes per game, and he\\'s scored at an above-average rate in isolation and as a pick-and-roll ball-handler.As (or if) Sacramento fills out the roster around Fox with more reliable offensive players, and defenses can afford less focus on the point guard, Fox\\'s ability to attack one-on-one will yield even better overall numbers.Domantas Sabonis\\' first All-Star campaign has been a doozy.And his basic averages of 18.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 0.8 steals might not even do his production justice.Let\\'s take a look at a pace- and playing time-adjusted comparison to 2013-14 Kevin Love, who finished\\xa0second\\xa0in the league in box plus/minus:The key differences, of course, were Love\\'s scoring and the fact that he was hitting threes, but the statistical similarities are unavoidable.The Indiana Pacers have a superstar talent on their team who can score around the rim and from the\\xa0mid-range. His passing unlocks opportunities for teammates like T.J. Warren, Malcolm Brogdon and Victor Oladipo.And he\\'s almost certainly better defensively than the 25-year-old Love.The Pacers allow\\xa04.8\\xa0fewer points per 100 possessions with Sabonis on the floor this season. And that isn\\'t exclusively a function of the time spent with Myles Turner (though it helps). Indiana still defends at an\\xa0above-average\\xa0level when Sabonis plays without Turner.He\\'s not a lockdown defender on the perimeter or a lights-out rim protector, but he generally does a decent job of just being in the way. Sometimes, that\\'s enough from a big man. That and his ability to dominate the defensive glass makes Sabonis a plus on that end.Treating Ja Morant as a top-10 point guard and top-30ish player overall is not a rush to coronation. He\\'s earned it.Rookies seldom ferry his workload while sustaining above-average efficiency. Walter Davis, Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O\\'Neal and David Robinson are the only other first-year players who have matched his usage (26) and true shooting percentage (56.8).Morant\\'s game is essentially the marriage of flash and substance. His off-the-dribble escapism bends defenses and renders traditional bigs forced to switch or rotate on to him a special kind of helpless. Every dunk attempt is an event—even the missed ones. And though his takeoffs may, on some level, be for the \\'gram, they change the way teams must guard him inside the free-throw line.Tremendous downhill touch only complicates the pickle in which Morant puts defenses. He complements his explosion with split-second finesse. Could-be rim assaults are also potential scoop shots. He\\'s hitting 51.3 percent of his floaters.That Morant partners this touch with on-a-whim vision is unfair. He\\'s more of an equal opportunity scorer and facilitator than a points-first engine. His improvisation on the move belies his experience. He might possibly lead the league in assists thrown after leaving his feet.Knowing that Morant has room to improve is scary. Fewer of his passes will go haywire as he gains more reps, and his occasional off-the-dribble three could turn into a moderate- or high-volume staple.Left alone, though, Morant already holds his own against the NBA\\'s best offensive players, and his first season is almost beyond comparison to others. Oscar Robertson and Trae Young are the only other rookies to clear 20 points and eight assists per 36 minutes.CJ McCollum leaves a lot to be desired when viewing his game through the lens of conventional stardom.He doesn\\'t get to the rim or foul line at a high clip and is a coin-toss finisher when he does attack the basket. He has great chemistry with bigs out of the pick-and-roll, can spot shooters while going downhill and boasts great ball control but is overtaxed as the primary setup man.The Portland Trail Blazers offense when he plays without Damian Lillard has only ranked higher than the 38th percentile once over the past five seasons (2015-16).By those measures, McCollum could be overrated, now more so than ever after he signed a three-year, $100 million extension over the summer. But his standing is only compromised insofar as you\\'re still expecting him to be someone else.Portland isn\\'t paying him to be a situational No. 1. He is meant to be the team\\'s No. 2 through and through, a certified buckets-getter who can moonlight as a playmaker but earns his keep by providing cornerstone offense as Lillard\\'s second in command.McCollum has seldom failed to hold up his end of this bargain. He is one of the smoothest scorers alive. It\\'d be nice if he could swish more off-the-dribble threes, but he doesn\\'t need to lean on outside volume when he wields an automatic in-between game. He is shooting 47 percent from mid-range overall (89th percentile) and keeps defenses guessing with a mix of deadly accurate floaters (45.7 percent) and stop-and-pop twos (50.0 percent).What separates McCollum from, say, Zach LaVine isn\\'t just a matter of opportunity. He\\'s in the ideal role for his skill set, but he\\'s also shown everything he does translates to the playoff pressure cooker. He can still get to his spots in cramped spaces and doesn\\'t receive nearly enough credit for his tough-shot making.That he also collects his 20-plus points per game without significantly eating into the usage of those around him—he\\'s downing 47.1 percent of his catch-and-fire threes—is very on-brand. He\\'s made a career out of effectively straddling the line between star and complement.Struggling through consecutive postseasons did little to slow Donovan Mitchell\\'s hype train. Anyone would be overburdened as his team\\'s sole from-scratch scorer. Every star must have a viable No. 2. The Utah Jazz needed to get Mitchell his.And then they did. Sort of.The Mike Conley acquisition hasn\\'t panned out, but Bojan Bogdanovic and Jordan Clarkson adequately stock Utah\\'s roster with shot-makers, even if they\\'re not letter-of-the-law sidekicks. The offense should be more equipped to handle the postseason crucible because of them, albeit less so following Bogdanovic\\'s season-ending wrist injury. The idea of Conley can still be an asset, too.But Mitchell\\'s numbers aren\\'t yet reflective of the Jazz\\'s sturdier offensive depth. Though his scoring is almost identical to last season\\'s (25.4 points per 36 minutes) and coming on better efficiency, his true shooting percentage (56.0) remains below the league average (56.4). Long twos are, somehow, an even bigger part of his game, and they\\'re coming at the expense of his volume around the rim.Taking fewer shots at the basket has cut into Mitchell\\'s foul-line trips, and he wasn\\'t an especially frequent customer at the charity stripe in the first place. Among the 40 players with a usage rate of 25 or higher, his free-throw-attempt rate ranks 33rd.Keeping his three-point clip above 36 percent is a win, but only a minor one. He\\'s still not knocking down deep balls off the dribble; he\\'s converting just 31.6 percent of his pull-up triples.Age and role ensure Mitchell will remain the Jazz\\'s most important building block. That\\'s different from their most valuable player. Rudy Gobert still holds that honor, and Mitchell hasn\\'t made enough of a jump to suggest that\\'s about to change.Utah is getting slaughtered whenever he plays without the Stifle Tower while posting a crummy offensive rating. This doesn\\'t mean Mitchell is bad. He\\'s not. It does mean he has a long way to go before the Jazz can comfortably declare him the face of the future.All the tricks Shai Gilgeous-Alexander flashed as a rookie have proved to be but a prelude. He is no longer a young prospect ahead of schedule. He\\'s one of the NBA\\'s most underrated scorers.Gilgeous-Alexander has made great use of the extra license the Oklahoma City Thunder have bestowed upon him. His three-point clip is down, but he\\'s stayed above 35 percent while creating more of his own opportunities. Under 10 percent of his made treys came without assists last year. That number has soared up to over 43 percent this season.Exchanging looks at the rim for longer twos is often frowned upon, but the in-between game suits Gilgeous-Alexander. He\\'s knocking down 45.0 percent of his mid-range jumpers (83rd percentile) and splashing in 45.9 percent of his floaters.Endorsing his shot distribution is even easier when it comes with a rising free-throw-attempt rate. He has added more changes in pace and in-and-out dribbles to his repository and is much better at finishing through contact from outside the restricted area.Others will be lower on Gilgeous-Alexander until he brings more oomph as a playmaker. His opportunity is finite beside both Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder, but he continues to look more like a hybrid wing than a combo guard. Oklahoma City\\'s offense has sputtered whenever he plays without Paul, and he\\'s tallied just 109 possessions as the official point guard.As is, though, Gilgeous-Alexander can be the second-best offensive player on a ridiculously good team. And he doesn\\'t necessarily need to approximate floor-general value when he\\'s so darn useful at the other end. He can make life hell on both guard spots and even wing-sized whatevers. The Thunder haven\\'t shied from using him on Ben Simmons- and Brandon Ingram-types.His All-Star peak isn\\'t just in play. It feels inevitable.Somewhat lost amid Jayson Tatum\\'s climb into superstar territory is the humdinger of a season Jaylen Brown has pieced together. He\\'s averaging a career-high 20.4 points per game while downing 38.1 percent of his threes and a gaga 55.2 percent of his twos. After three years of hovering in the mid-60s, his free-throw conversion rate sits at 73.6 percent—on a personal-best 4.6 attempts per 36 minutes, no less.Brown\\'s progress is palpable enough that he generated some All-Star buzz. His failure to make the cut shouldn\\'t be spun into anything too profound, but it does nod to a certain lagging. He\\'s still stereotyped into more of a specialist\\'s box rather than formal stardom.Whether that\\'s unfair is in the eye of the beholder. The Boston Celtics don\\'t yet know if they can win a title with Brown as their third-best player, and he\\'ll always pale in comparison to most of his would-be peers on the offensive end. His is a role rooted more in finishing plays than creating them.Over half of his possessions come as transition or spot-up opportunities, and close to 90 percent of his made threes are assisted. His volume as the pick-and-roll ball-handler has more than doubled from last season, but he doesn\\'t pass enough for the offense to actually run through him, and his handle can get unglued when he\\'s tasked with doing more than attacking decongested lanes.Without a semi-sizable shift in focus, this caps Brown\\'s apex much like it does for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander—in that it\\'s marginally prohibitive but mostly doesn\\'t matter because of the heavy lifting he does at the other end.Boston\\'s three-wing lineups wouldn\\'t be so effective without Brown\\'s defensive bandwidth. He rumbles with power forwards more than Tatum or Gordon Hayward, and only Marcus Smart sees more reps against No. 1 options, according to data from Nylon Calculus\\' Krishna Narsu. Brown\\'s presence on the glass is likewise paramount to the Celtics using the good-but-undersized Daniel Theis so freely at the 5.Elite three-and-D specialists have fringe-star value. Brown is more than that. He has a broader offensive responsibility than catch-and-shoot connoisseurs, and his combination of volume and efficiency verges on anomalous. Giannis Antetokounmpo, DeMar DeRozan, Khris Middleton and Brandon Ingram are the only wings who match his scoring, usage and true shooting percentage.If you\\'re thinking this placement is over-ambitious for a 19-year-old rookie who has only played 565 minutes, you\\'re not alone. Even the writers behind this project struggled with the idea of Zion Williamson already being a top-four power forward.But his numbers leap off the screen about as explosively as the player himself leaves the hardwood.The New Orleans Pelicans\\' net points per 100 possessions is 12.2 points better with Zion on the floor, a swing that ranks in the 97th percentile and adds an estimated 29 wins to the team\\'s expectancy over an 82-game slate.His 27.5 points per 75 possessions is the second-highest mark for a rookie since 1973-74 (as far back as per-possession data goes), just behind Joel Embiid in 2016-17 and just ahead of 1984-85 Michael Jordan.Zion\\'s 62.4 true shooting percentage ranks first among rookies who logged a 25-plus usage percentage over the same span. Arvydas Sabonis (who was 31 during his rookie season) and David Robinson (24) wind up the top three.As far as scoring and impact go, Williamson pretty clearly justifies his position on this list. His feel in both fast breaks and halfcourt sets is way beyond his years. He knows exactly when to cut and sees lanes opening up seemingly ahead of time. His second jump is absurd, maybe even on par with a prime Shawn Marion, whose playing weight was 60-plus pounds lighter.Offensively, the next steps for Zion are probably a more consistent jump shot and a bit more playmaking for others. But even without those things, he\\'s already a devastating offensive weapon.He needs a lot more work on the other end. His focus there seems to come and go far too often. His block and steal rates from college haven\\'t yet translated. And it feels like he should be gobbling up more defensive rebounds. But we have to remember that he\\'s a rookie. And he\\'s a 19-year-old rookie. The learning curve for NBA defenders is steep.What\\'s clear is that he has the physical tools to dominate defensively. His basketball IQ on offense suggests he should be able to pick up the concepts necessary to be a plus on both sides of the ball. But even if he doesn\\'t live up to his potential as a defender and becomes, say, average on that end, his offense would still make him a mainstay at the top of lists like this.Brandon Ingram has come of role this season. Beforehand, he was the silhouette of an offensive hub, but only for stretches at a time, usually toward the end of the schedule. This year, on a new team that has given him more creative agency, he\\'s been a wire-to-wire force.His All-Star selection speaks for itself, even though it came during a down year for Western Conference wings. His numbers say even more: 24.3 points and 4.3 assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 59.0—benchmarks that, prior to this year, have only ever been hit by one player in his age-22-or-younger season. That player\\'s name? Michael Jordan.Friendlier circumstances (and a cleaner health bill) aren\\'t solely responsible for Ingram\\'s ascent. He has both broadened and refined his game.He\\'s always had a knack for reaching his spots on-ball and making plays at the rim, but his finishing lagged elsewhere. He now wields a more consistent touch between 10 and 16 feet and a more willing trigger finger from beyond the arc. Both his three-point and free-throw clips have exploded relative to his career average.What\\'s most impressive about Ingram\\'s arrival isn\\'t the leap itself but its endurance. His improvement has not only spanned the entire season, but it\\'s also survived two different iterations of the New Orleans Pelicans: pre-Zion Williamson and post-Zion Williamson.Slightly lower usage beside Zion has not rattled Ingram. He\\'s been money in catch-and-shoot situations (60.2 effective field-goal percentage), and his true shooting percentage has dropped without plummeting when they share the floor. Encouraging still, across a 704-possession sample, New Orleans owns a plus-14.6 net rating with Ingram and Zion manning the 3 and 4, respectively.This is not a small development. Ingram\\'s success as part of a larger operation, one that doesn\\'t always default to him, was never a given. Deference can throw players off balance.Ingram himself still has kinks to work out next to Zion, but the early returns suggest his leap is at once permanent and, just as important, generally adaptable.Any lingering urges to loop Devin Booker into the empty-stats brigade need to be stamped out. That stance was always hyperbolic. Youth needs time to marinate, and the Phoenix Suns never put enough NBA talent around him to infer a correlation between him and their downtrodden record.They still haven\\'t. The Suns are much better off than they were in 2018-19 when Booker wanted for the most fundamental ball-handling support. But the core he headlines now still isn\\'t perfectly designed to simplify his role or guarantee palatable proximity to the Western Conference playoff picture.Adding Ricky Rubio is a start. Booker is no longer Phoenix\\'s only primary playmaker. But he remains its most influential one. The Suns rank in the 79th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when Booker is on the floor. That efficiency bottoms out to the 2nd percentile in the minutes Rubio plays without him. (Phoenix\\'s offense is in the 33rd percentile when Booker runs the show on his own.)What little relief Booker has received—mainly from Rubio, career-year Kelly Oubre Jr. and Deandre Ayton—looks awfully good on him. His efficiency has been on the come-up for most of his career, and he\\'s reached yet another new height this season.Among the 58 non-bigs who have played at least 1,000 minutes and are averaging at least 15 points, Booker\\'s true shooting percentage ranks fourth, behind Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton and Davis Bertans. He\\'s on pace to become the 10th player to clear 25 points and five assists per game with a true shooting percentage higher than 61, joining James Harden (six times), LeBron James (six times), Michael Jordan (four times), Stephen Curry (three times), Kevin Durant (three times), Larry Bird (twice), Giannis Antetokounmpo (twice), Isaiah Thomas and Lillard.Between his continuously improving feel for jump-starting an offense, multilevel scoring and the ability to leverage touch and cutting without the ball, Booker is now, without question, one of the league\\'s most impactful players.Bam Adebayo may embody the\\xa0future\\xa0of the center position more than anyone on this list. He has the size (6\\'9\", 255 pounds) to play the 5, but he can be trusted to switch onto any position, handle the ball, facilitate, finish inside and even do a little damage in the floater zone.On the season, he\\'s averaging a well-rounded 16.2 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.2 steals per game. The only thing left is three-point range. And that may be on the way. According to ESPN\\'s Zach Lowe, he went 31-of-50 on corner threes in a predraft workout for the Miami Heat.In an increasingly positionless NBA, guys who can do everything will reign.Michael Pina\\xa0wrote for SB Nation:\"When [the Heat] look at Adebayo they don\\'t see a position, and even before they took him 14th overall in the 2017 draft they didn\\'t see a prospect who should be boxed into a role. Adebayo is an original, one-of-one — a jittery ball of unselfish, peerlessly athletic energy whose lone hobby is discovering new ways to dismantle traditional norms on a basketball court.\"On the season, 16\\xa0players have taken at least 10 shots when defended by Adebayo. They vary from point guards like Markelle Fultz, Russell Westbrook and Spencer Dinwiddie, to wings like Bradley Beal, to bigs like Joel Embiid and Nikola Vucevic. Only two of those 16 shot at least 50 percent against Bam. And Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, was 8-of-23 (34.8 percent).The tenacity and versatility of Adebayo makes him an ideal defensive anchor for the Heat, alongside Jimmy Butler. But his potential on the offensive end may be every bit as tantalizing.Adebayo isn\\'t just making run-of-the-mill kick-outs from the post for his assists. He\\'s passing on the move, out of rolls, from the top of the key or the elbow. He\\'s comfortable passing with either hand. And his vision may be better than any big man\\'s, save Jokic\\'s.The next evolution for this position is \"point center.\" Jokic has been doing that for a while with the Nuggets. Adebayo brings significantly more athleticism to the equation.Jrue Holiday is the same as ever: damn good and underappreciated.Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson have all taken turns overshadowing him on offense, which is to be expected. They\\'re new and shiny, and Holiday has almost always blurred the line between primary option and complement. But his role hasn\\'t actually changed all that much alongside the New Orleans Pelicans\\' most prominent additions.Sure, his usage is slightly down. And yes, he\\'s taking the occasional extra standstill jumper. For the most part, though, he remains New Orleans\\' offensive engine.No one on the team runs more pick-and-rolls per game, and rather than ween off his self-creation, he\\'s steered further into it. He looks more comfortable dancing with the ball in his hands and is churning through an almost identical number of pull-up jumpers compared to last season. More of his made threes are actually going unassisted (44.3 percent, up from 40.7), and he continues to bust out his step-back jumper.Plenty of scorers shoot higher clips, but Holiday is efficient enough relative to his role. He\\'s hitting more than 50.0 percent of his two-pointers and within striking distance of league-average accuracy from distance (35.7 percent) while putting up nearly 20 points and seven assists per game.Demands to drop Holiday further likely don\\'t properly value his defense. The idea that he\\'s not as much of a neutralizer is, frankly, a little absurd—like his job description.Just look at the six players he\\'s spent the most time guarding: Luka Doncic, LeBron James, CJ McCollum, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Damian Lillard and Devin Booker. I mean, my goodness. Difficult assignments don\\'t equate to good defense, but Holiday is the exhaustive ball hawk the Pelicans stick on the very best without sending him much help.Finding another player who bears his burden at both ends is almost impossible. Two-way primary usage, a metric developed by Nylon Calculus\\' Krishna Narsu, measures the amount of time a player spends as the No. 1 option on offense while guarding the other team\\'s No. 1 scorer. Ben Simmons is the only player in the league with a higher two-way workload than Holiday.Sharing the offensive workload with fellow star teammates and a quality supporting cast looks good on Kemba Walker. It would look even better if left knee problems didn\\'t cost him a chunk of the season.Sticking him this low could come off as an insult. It isn\\'t. It is more so a nod to the league\\'s depth of star power—especially at point guard. Eight floor generals are in front of him, and with the exception of the top two or three, Walker has an argument to be ahead of everyone else. Welcome to the world of splitting hairs.On the surface, Walker is not a material upgrade over Kyrie Irving for the Boston Celtics. He is scoring at a lower and less efficient clip, and their average touch time is about the same. Walker is actually controlling the ball for longer per possessions than 2018-19 Irving.The bigger, more important difference lies in Walker\\'s usage. He is a better complement than Irving to the rest of Boston\\'s roster, a comfier fit who has paved the way for Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward to do more.Fewer of Walker\\'s buckets are coming off assists (36 percent) compared to his predecessor (37.3 percent), but he works in isolation much less. Both may be similar in how long they hold onto the ball, but Walker burns through fewer touches overall. And it is Walker who gives more consistent damns on defense.Mind you, ceding touches to his supporting cast and status to Tatum has not dulled Walker\\'s star quality. He is the Celtics\\' best pick-and-roll initiator, leading the team in crunch-time usage rate and draining 36.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers, which he launches more often than everyone in the league except for Luka Doncic, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Tatum\\'s ascent has rendered him Boston\\'s most valuable player, but Walker still has claim to the team\\'s offensive crown. The Celtics are scoring a team-high 7.6 points more per 100 possessions with him on the court, during which time their perimeter-shooting efficiency skyrockets.This steadying star power is nothing new. Spending his entire career in Charlotte may have limited his national exposure, but Walker has been this same bracing force for some time. Five-year regularized-adjusted plus-minus ranks him as the sixth-most valuable offensive player since 2015, according to NBA Shot Charts. His role may have shifted in Boston, but he\\'s still clearly among the NBA\\'s very best.Trae Young\\'s detractors needn\\'t reach deep into the bag to find their rebuke: If he\\'s this good, if he\\'s already a top-25 player, why aren\\'t the Atlanta Hawks better? It\\'s a fair question. And Young\\'s defense alone might provide the answer.Catch-all metrics portray him as a certifiable nonfactor at the less glamorous end. He is dead-last in ESPN\\'s defensive real plus-minus and NBA Shot Charts\\' luck-adjusted defensive regularized adjusted plus-minus. And he ranks third-to-last, ahead of just Bradley Beal and Darius Garland, in NBA Math\\'s defensive points saved.Non-defenders can be tricky cornerstones. They complicate attempts to build contenders. The breadth of Young\\'s offense does not excuse his transgressions at the other end. But it comes pretty damn close.Young\\'s ultra-deep pull-up threes warp entire defenses. Planning for someone who\\'s willing to fire away just inside the timeline is a migraine-and-a-half. Young exacerbates the defense\\'s dilemma by actually making those shots. He\\'s converting 35.8 percent of his looks from 29 feet and out.A lack of size (6\\'1\") has not hindered his capacity to make plays inside the arc. He has perfected the arc and timing of his floaters and ranks in the 92nd percentile of finishing around the rim. His 9.3 assists per game are not the byproduct of how much time he spends on the ball but an accurate reflection of his vision. He beams one-handed dimes on the move before it\\'s even clear he\\'s picked up his dribble, confuses defenders by telegraphing one pass but throwing another and threads the needle against double-teams he\\'s not supposed to see over.Atlanta\\'s offense is not elite with Young on the floor (54th percentile), but it\\'s subject to a monster drop-off when he sits—an 11.8-point-per-100-possessions plunge that ranks as the third-largest in the league among every player who has cleared 500 minutes.Put a more established supporting cast around Young, and the wins and losses should take care of themselves. He\\'s averaging 29.6 points and 9.3 assists with a 59.5 true shooting percentage as the all-everything of an offense light on polished talent. Adding another ball-handler alone would go a long way, granting him an actual chance to work as a spot-up and motion shooter.In the meantime, he cannot be too harshly penalized for the constraints placed upon him by the circumstances under which he plays. He has outperformed the degree of difficulty attached to his role. So few players have ever balanced his volume with this efficiency—10 in league history, to be more exact: Adrian Dantley (four times); James Harden (four times); Michael Jordan (three times); Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (two times); Kevin Durant (two times); Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Karl Malone and Bob McAdoo.Slotting Russell Westbrook any higher would demand selective memory.Indeed, he turned a corner once the Houston Rockets steered into microball. He\\'s averaging 31.0 points and 5.8 assists with a 57.5 true shooting percentage since Clint Capela left the rotation. Close to 56 percent of his field-goal attempts are coming inside five feet during this time, compared to 46.3 percent beforehand, where he\\'s shooting 63.4 percent, up from 58.8 percent.It would not be a stretch to say this is the best version of Westbrook ever. The Oklahoma City Thunder never afforded him so much room to maneuver, not even during the Kevin Durant years.His downhill attacks are a different kind of terrifying—and almost impossible to stop—when he\\'s not forced to navigate cramped spaces. He\\'s even upped his accuracy from downtown, to 35.5 percent, while curbing his volume.Still, the first part of the season happened. Westbrook was on course for the fourth-worst true shooting percentage of his career prior to Jan. 1 while firing up far too many threes, during which time the Rockets failed to keep their head above water whenever he played without James Harden. Opponents outscored them by 4.3 points per 100 possessions, with a sub-105 offensive rating, through his solo stints.Westbrook deserves credit for flipping the script, even before Capela\\'s injury and eventual departure. Since Jan. 1, Houston is pumping in 113.9 points per 100 possessions and posting a plus-3.7 net rating when he runs the show without Harden. But those returns have done yet another 180 since Jan. 29, when Capela last played for the Rockets.This level of inconsistency is unsettling. The Rockets are significantly worse off, both now and later, if they cannot count on Westbrook to successfully spearhead units without Harden. His most recent performance is proof he still has the impact of a top-25 player, but his top-15 case is no longer airtight. His average rank across six catch-all-metrics, in fact, suggests he should be lower—closer to No. 40 overall than No. 20.Bradley Beal exists in a gray area of superstardom.Merely having him doesn\\'t assure playoff contention, which puts him outside the top-15-player conversation. And yet, he\\'s also an offense unto himself, fully capable of crashing the All-NBA discourse in any given season. Pegging him as anything less than a top-25 player isn\\'t an option.And to be clear, no one should want it to be.The Washington Wizards\\' hard-knocks season isn\\'t on Beal. He\\'s eclipsing 30 points and six assists per game with an above-average true shooting percentage, all while subsisting on a diet of difficult shots. James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook are the only players tossing up more contested looks, defined as any attempt during which a defender is between two and four feet away.Granted, even without John Wall in the fold, Beal doesn\\'t shoulder the same from-scratch burden many of his contemporaries do. Nearly half of his made buckets are coming off assists. But what he avoids in next-level difficulty, he makes up for with sheer volume. He owns the league\\'s fifth-highest usage rate, trailing only Trae Young, Luka Doncic, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo.Attributing his numbers exclusively to that volume undermines their significance. This isn\\'t a good-to-greatish player stat-padding on a bad-to-terribleish team. The Wizards offense is optimized through his usage. They go from scoring 114 points per 100 possessions with him on the court (81st percentile) to 106.2 with him off (18th percentile)—a wrong-direction swing that typifies his importance to a team with zero first-option alternatives.Cue the annual \"Kyle Lowry is too damn high!\" pitchfork-carriers.Every time someone tries their hand at sorting the NBA\\'s best, his name invariably appears in front of a few others who seem to deserve more due. How is he ahead of Russell Westbrook? Or Kemba Walker? It makes no sense.In actuality, it makes perfect sense. Lowry\\'s value might even be underrated. He doesn\\'t carry the largest load relative to other point guards or stars at large, but that\\'s part of his charm. He routinely shape-shifts based on the Toronto Raptors\\' depth chart and lineups.Last year, this meant deferring shots and possessions to Kawhi Leonard and the rise of Pascal Siakam. In seasons past, it meant giving DeMar DeRozan the leeway to expand his playmaking portfolio. And this year—well, this year is some of Lowry\\'s best work yet. He has juggled taking on more of the scoring burden without inhibiting Siakam\\'s continued ascent.Few point guards afford teams so much wiggle room. Having the ability to splash in off-the-bounce threes, break down defenses, drill standstill jumpers and cover larger backcourt assignments while playing beside another smaller guard is different from actually doing it.Lowry doesn\\'t dabble so much as he balances. He is an offensive chameleon. Look no further than his shot distribution. Almost 27 percent of his field-goal attempts come as spot-up threes. Nearly 31 percent, meanwhile, come as pull-up treys. He can both dictate and accommodate the terms of how Toronto plays.His case is only bolstered by the energy he expends on defense. He frustrates opponents in search of offensive fouls and has the stubborn strength to tussle with assignments much larger than himself (6\\'0\").There is likewise a Damian Lillard-esque air about the way he sets the tone, the author of both culture and identity. The Raptors defend and carry themselves like Kyle Lowry clones. He might not be Toronto\\'s best player—though he was during the DeRozan years—but he is certainly its most important.The numbers support as much. He doesn\\'t lead the Raptors in scoring. Or have their highest net rating swing. But his average rank across six catch-all metrics pegs him as the league\\'s 21st most valuable player (and sixth-best point guard), putting him just ahead of Siakam (No. 26).The benefit of the doubt has assured Kyrie Irving a relatively high finish. And yes, he deserves it.Right shoulder and right knee issues have limited him to just 20 games. His season was deemed over before the NBA suspended play after undergoing surgery to address the former injury. This awfully small sample size cannot be discounted when assessing his value.Plenty of people will argue that Irving should be lower, if not left out altogether. Neither would be a totally unfair claim were we discussing the bigger picture. Murky availability has been a career-long problem, and it is fair to wonder how much worse off his teams actually are without him.Though the Brooklyn Nets have played shorthanded all season, they\\'re still 22-22 when he sits, compared to 8-12 when he\\'s in the lineup. And it doesn\\'t help that the Boston Celtics have not just tread water but improved following his departure over the summer.Now still isn\\'t the time to relitigate Irving\\'s cornerstone value. Brooklyn is the first team for which he has chosen to play, and sweeping conclusions cannot be drawn until he\\'s integrated into a healthier roster. Between injuries to him, Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert, in addition to the exit of head coach Kenny Atkinson, the Nets have not exactly been a portrait of stability.To what extent this falls on Irving isn\\'t readily known. Atkinson\\'s departure coupled with the usual dose of quixotic comments are, at bottom, instruments for debate. But drama and skepticism and health can only nuke Irving\\'s stock if he fails to outstrip the collective concern on the court. That\\'s almost never been his problem.This season is no exception. Through his 20 appearances, Irving averaged 27.4 points and 6.4 assists on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. He still isn\\'t the guy you trust to reach the rim or get to the foul line in volume, but his off-the-dribble shot-making continues to bend the brain. He has buried 38.6 percent of his pull-up threes and rates in the 91st percentile of scoring efficiency as the pick-and-roll ball-handler.Small samples are conducive to noise, but for what it\\'s worth, Irving has also proved to be a more consistent finisher around the basket in Brooklyn. His 65 percent clip at the hoop is a career high.Less debatable is the overall impact he has on the Nets offense. They score 6.4 points per 100 possessions more when he\\'s on the floor, a swing that places in the 92nd percentile and is right in line with his on-off splits through five of the past six seasons. Brooklyn nearly gives everything back on defense when Irving plays, but his offensive credentials squarely put him among the NBA\\'s most valuable players, even amid abbreviated availability.Before the hiatus, Rudy Gobert led the NBA in ESPN\\'s defensive real plus-minus for the fourth consecutive season.He dominated the field in FiveThirtyEight\\'s new catch-all, defensive RAPTOR rating, which incorporates box score numbers, on-off data and tracking data.His value there is so immense that he ranks fifth in the NBA in RAPTOR wins above replacement, behind only\\xa0James Harden, LeBron James, Antetokounmpo and Kawhi Leonard, despite posting a negative offensive RAPTOR rating.He doesn\\'t seem to have the narrative on his side for a third straight DPOY, but he clearly has an argument.Tune into any Utah Jazz game, and you\\'ll almost certainly see multiple possessions on which a perimeter player dusts his matchup on the outside, gets to the paint and then does an abrupt U-turn upon seeing Gobert. It\\'s a phenomenon that traditional box scores struggle to capture.The way to neutralize that, of course, is by deploying a modern 5 who pulls Gobert from the rim. He does a decent job while playing one-on-one out there, but simply having him out of the paint can break down a Jazz defense that featured only Royce O\\'Neale and Joe Ingles as clear plus defenders outside.That\\'s probably the biggest knock against Gobert. As the Houston Rockets have shown, there are ways to game-plan around his dominance. His career postseason net-rating swing is minus-10.1.Generally speaking, though, he remains one of the most impactful players in the league. His plus-11.0 net-rating swing this regular season ranked in the 95th percentile. He\\'s a devastating, dedicated rim runner, even when high-usage players like Donovan Mitchell don\\'t throw the eventual lob. Just having Gobert attack the rim out of the pick-and-roll bends defenses toward the paint.He\\'s also a staple on the screen-assists leaderboard, generating a league-leading 16.1 points per game off those plays.Put it all together, and it isn\\'t difficult to see why Gobert is still one of the game\\'s best centers, despite not having the guard skills most others have had to develop for survival.It isn\\'t impossible to find a precedent for Pascal Siakam\\'s career trajectory, you might just have to venture outside basketball.Going from 4.2 points as a rookie, to 7.3 points as a sophomore, to 16.9 points and a Most Improved Player in Year 3 is wild enough. Then, Siakam made being the first back-to-back winner of that award feel like a real possibility early in the season.Being elevated to the No. 1 option following Kawhi Leonard\\'s departure torpedoed Siakam\\'s true shooting percentage, but he\\'s still\\xa015th in the league in points per game (23.6) and is posting a slightly-above-average three-point percentage (35.9) on 6.0 attempts.This kind of production is a far cry from the projections of Siakam back when he was a borderline first-round prospect in 2016.\"To even think that I\\'m in the conversation, I have an opportunity to be [in the NBA], that\\'s crazy to me,\" Siakam told Bleacher Report\\'s C.J. Moore three months before he was drafted. \"For me, it\\'s just about working hard every day and getting better. The thought of knowing that I might one day be there is amazing for me.\"Four years later, Siakam is an All-Star and the leading scorer for a 46-18 team defending a championship.And if that trajectory is any guide, he may not be done improving. The next step is merging the efficiency with which he played in a lesser role in 2018-19 with the volume he has had in 2019-20. If he does that, Toronto could remain a title contender for the foreseeable future.As for defense, there aren\\'t many question marks there. The 6\\'9\" forward can ably defend multiple positions and rarely gets lost in the Raptors\\' scheme. For the third straight year, Toronto is surrendering\\xa0fewer points per 100 possessions when Siakam is on the floor.Is there a more plug-and-play superstar than Paul George?Perhaps out of depth as the every-possession No. 1, he has dominated while working off another primary ball-handler in each of the past three seasons. That\\'s not a given for everyone of his stature.Better players would struggle when having less granular control over the offense. Paul\\'s game is made for that balancing act. It is seamless.Displacing him from the ball gives you one of the league\\'s most dangerous standstill shooters. He has ranked no lower than the 74th percentile of spot-up efficiency through the last five seasons.Tasking him with from-scratch creation leaves you with a viable source of offense. George\\'s 53.2 effective field-goal percentage when shooting out of the pick-and-roll is the 10th-highest among 56 players finishing at least five such possessions per game, and his 38.2 percent success rate on pull-up triples ranks fifth out of everyone firing three or more per game.George distinguishes himself from players who wear similar hats by virtue of his role allocation. He can spend more time as the de facto No. 1 than most other sidekicks. He is at home swishing jumpers after coming around ball screens, even if his turnover woes out of the pick-and-roll are closer to the rule than the exception.\"Playoff P\" is both a laughably lame name for his alter ego and an actual thing (last year\\'s five-game letdown against Portland notwithstanding).Don\\'t bother arguing that George belongs any lower after missing a bunch of time with right shoulder and left hamstring issues. This is his conservative finish. In any normal season, his context-proof offense and All-NBA defense—playing next to Kawhi Leonard hasn\\'t spared him from pestering the best 1s and 2s—earns top-10-player consideration.Ben Simmons\\' finite offensive range is problematic in that nearly 90 percent of his attempts come inside eight feet. He doesn\\'t even have break-in-case-of-emergency touch beyond there. And yet, his limitations are far from crippling.Simmons has the speed and size (6\\'10\") to thrive amid his own shortcomings. He\\'s still in the 93rd percentile of finishing around the rim, and defenses remain inclined to collapse around him when he\\'s going downhill.It is within this chaos that Simmons\\' passing IQ shines. He is a drive-and-kick whiz and has the floor awareness to hit trailing shooters and sling dimes to the corners. No one has assisted on more three-pointers than him, according to PBP Stats.None of this is license to entirely ignore the elephant in the room. Simmons\\' jumper-less repertoire is an issue, and there seems to exist a clear disconnect between him and head coach Brett Brown, who so obviously wants his 23-year-old superstar to branch out.The operative word here is \"superstar.\" Simmons is flirting with the pinnacle of his profession while skirting one of its most sought-after skills. That speaks to everything else he does, particularly on defense. He can lock down lifelines for entire games.Nobody in the league qualifies as a more versatile defender. Simmons has spent at least 17 percent of his time guarding every position on the floor, save for center, according to Nylon Calculus\\' Krishna Narsu. And among every player who has logged at least 1,000 minutes, only\\xa0Terrance Ferguson and Royce O\\'Neale have racked up more reps against No. 1 options.Reconciling Simmons\\' offensive sins is admittedly tougher this side of his five-year max extension. Superstar pay grades come with increased scrutiny and less patience. That the Philadelphia 76ers offense is slightly more efficient with him off the floor this season cannot be written off. But it can be contextualized.Philly took an already unevenly built roster last summer and leaned into the awkwardness. Simmons\\' drawbacks aren\\'t new. The Sixers knew who he was when they maxed him out and surrounded him with too little shooting and neither enough ball-handling nor spacing to explore what he can do away from the action. That he\\'s come so far despite his team working against him in so many ways is a testament to his value.The list of players who had a better offensive box plus/minus than Karl-Anthony Towns\\' 4.8 through five seasons is short (and impressive): Michael Jordan (7.9), LeBron James (6.2), Vince Carter (5.4), Chris Paul (5.3), Nikola Jokic (5.2), David Robinson (5.2), Charles Barkley (5.1) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5.0).He isn\\'t quite the passer LeBron, CP3 or Jokic were right off the bat, though his career-high 4.4 assists per game this season shows progress, but Towns\\' hyper-efficient scoring arsenal makes him perhaps the game\\'s premier big-man weapon.Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who matches or exceeds Towns\\' career marks for points per 75 possessions (24.4) and true shooting percentage (62.2).\\xa0To get that level of scoring prowess out of a 5 is likely unimaginable for other organizations.And despite missing much of the season with injuries, Towns has shown he\\'s still developing.He\\'s posting career highs in points (26.5), assists (4.4), made threes (3.3) and effective field-goal percentage (60.0). No one has ever had a season that matches Towns\\' 2019-20 combination of efficiency, volume and rebounding.Progress on the defensive end seems to have stalled for Towns, though.\\xa0Minnesota allows a whopping 6.2 more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. Opponents\\' effective field-goal percentage is 3.4 points higher when he plays.His defensive rebounding and shot blocking (1.2 per game) provide value on that end, but he still loses focus far too often and is regularly caught out of position.But there\\'s no question his offensive contributions outweigh the defensive shortcomings. For the fifth time in five seasons, the Timberwolves\\' net rating is better with Towns on the floor.Every so often a superstar\\'s decline is not just exaggerated but invented. It is talked about as a matter of fact when, in reality, it has yet to begin.Such was the plight of Chris Paul entering this season. The Houston Rockets treated him as the less valuable player in their trade for Russell Westbrook, and the Oklahoma City Thunder tried to reroute him upon arrival. Some of this recurring reservation was precautionary. Paul is an undersized point guard (6\\'0\") on the verge of turning 35 and owed $85.6 million over the next two years. Time is a friend to neither his ability nor price point.Viewed against those concerns, Paul\\'s situation was still overblown. Even when presented with the disclaimer that the Thunder might keep the core intact past the trade deadline, they did not begin the year as a consensus playoff contender. That aloofness is atypical of a team built around a fringe top-10 player.Just so we\\'re clear: Paul absolutely remains a fringe top-10 player. His 17.7 points and 6.8 assists per game don\\'t leap off the page, but they come on tough-to-fathom efficiency. He is posting the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career and has been Kevin Durant automatic from mid-range, where he\\'s connecting on 53 percent of his looks, another personal best.Paul continues to take great pleasure in cooking bigs off the dribble when they switch on to him, and he is still a defensive bulldog. Even more impressive is the extent to which the Thunder thrive by leaning on him. Their offensive rating improves by 13.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, the second-largest such swing among anyone who has logged at least 250 minutes. (Of note: Danilo Gallinari, his teammate, is first.)This dependence carries over to crunch time, where Paul leads Oklahoma City in usage rate by a country mile. He\\'s slashing 53.5/36.0/93.8\\xa0in the clutch, which is just silly. Among every player with similar usage who has made at least five crunch-time appearances, only Joel Embiid owns a higher true shooting percentage, which is even sillier—and the core reason why the Thunder are 29-13 in clutch contests.When he\\'s engaged, Joel Embiid shows flashes of Rudy Gobert-level defense and Karl-Anthony Towns-level offense. Though probably a little shy of both comparisons, when combined, Embiid looks like he might be the best center in the game.He\\'s shown an ability to step out and hit threes or dominate a post-up like Towns. And his rim protection and recovery speed is elite in certain defensive possessions. But he struggles to consistently provide that level of play on both ends.Even with ebbs and flows of effort, though, his 23.4 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.3 blocks in 30.2 minutes per game impress.And for the fourth straight season, the Philadelphia 76ers\\' net rating is better with Embiid on the floor. His defensive-rating swing ranks in the 94th percentile, which is somehow a career\\xa0low.One thing he never struggles with is an ability to get to the line. Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Embiid\\'s 10.1 free-throw attempts per 75 possessions trails only Shaq\\'s 10.4.That\\'s why his true shooting percentage is always above average, despite a 51.4\\xa0effective field-goal percentage that falls shy of the 52.2 average during his career.When Embiid gets the ball, his mind often seems already made up to attack. And officials often can\\'t help but blow the whistle.Getting all those scoring possessions at the line has a compound effect. Embiid\\'s free-throw percentage yields around 1.6 points per two-shot trip to the line. And each whistle gets the opposition closer to the penalty and foul trouble.Embiid can be a great defender, floor spacer and post player, but his most consistent, valuable contribution might be that foul-drawing ability.Among players with at least 50 post-ups, Embiid leads the NBA with 1.12 points per post-up possession. But that\\'s buoyed by the fact that he draws shooting fouls on nearly a quarter of those possessions. His effective field-goal percentage out of the post ranks 16th, right behind teammate Ben Simmons.\\xa0\\xa0The process to get here wasn\\'t always smooth, even after a standout rookie season in 2017-18, but Jayson Tatum is now the guiding force through which the Boston Celtics play. It is on the back of this progression that he\\'s entered superstar territory.Skeptics like to harp on his efficiency. His 56.2 true shooting percentage is below the league average, and he\\'s banging in his mid-range jumpers at an unspectacular clip. Calling him erratic or unreliable still equates to misinformation.Relative to his shot quality, Tatum has actually outperformed expectations, according to PBP Stats.Among everyone attempting at least three pull-up triples per game, only Damian Lillard and Caris LeVert are downing theirs at a better clip.\\xa0Nikola Jokic is the lone soul who has converted more looks inside four seconds of the shot clock, and Tatum\\'s 55.7 effective field-goal percentage in these situations ranks first out of 104 players who have 50 or more relevant attempts under their belt.Having another scorer, aside from their point guard, so comfortable creating something out of nothing is a boon for the Celtics offense. They\\'ve more than doubled his pick-and-roll volume accordingly. And in recent months, he\\'s parlayed that additional responsibility into more volume around the hoop.Tatum\\'s playmaking does still trail expectations for someone in his role. He has the lowest assist rate of anyone with his usage. But the feel for throwing less obvious passes is there, and he\\'s proved capable of carrying league-average offensive units without Kemba Walker. His assist totals should approve with repetition.Through it all, Tatum has maintained the seamlessness of his offense. He hits a ton of self-created threes, but almost half of his overall shots come off assists. He dominates with his escape dribble and step-back three; he preserves his fit next to everyone else with his spot-up touch and opportunism in transition.This says nothing of his defense, which is borderline All-NBA-caliber. Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart streamline his workload by chasing around the glitziest assignments, but his help around the basket and free-safety gambles are one of the Celtics\\' most precious defensive devices.It is no accident Tatum owns their largest net-rating swing (plus-10.9). His two-way impact is their foremost building block.The Milwaukee Bucks need a second star.Scant few takes have become more outdated than this one. Reductive disclaimers haven\\'t aged much better.Khris Middleton isn\\'t a traditional No. 2 option.What in the what does that actually mean?Maybe the influx of superteams and superstar free-agency pairings over the past decade has restricted the criteria for sidekicks on championship contenders. That\\'s fair enough and perhaps a legitimate problem for the Bucks given the teams they most likely must get past in prospective Finals matchups.Except, well, it shouldn\\'t be considered an issue right now. If Middleton didn\\'t qualify as a genuine star before—and that\\'s a big if—he does this season.Middleton is tied with Damian Lillard for the highest true shooting percentage among everyone averaging more than 25 points per 36 minutes, a list populated almost exclusively by, you guessed it, consensus superstars. But it isn\\'t just these numbers. It\\'s the method by which they come.Misrepresenting Middleton\\'s place in the league usually begins with the assumption that he\\'s the benefactor of Giannis Antetokounmpo\\'s world domination and the Bucks\\' floor balance. Who wouldn\\'t thrive playing next to the NBA\\'s reigning MVP, inside four- and five-out lineups? Milwaukee\\'s environment no doubt glitters up Middleton\\'s role, but it hasn\\'t made him in full.Self-creation is ingrained into his game. He runs pick-and-rolls into pull-up jumpers. He shoots over mismatches in isolation and from the post. Tough fadeaways are business as usual. His off-the-dribble three is deployed in small doses but remains effective. He is the secondary playmaker everyone\\'s waiting for Jayson Tatum to be (which, for now, gives him a clear, albeit slight, edge over Boston\\'s fast-rising linchpin).In fairness to his critics, Middleton lacks a certain preponderance. His game still stalls out inside the arc, where he\\'s neither strong nor explosive enough to live at the basket. A career-low 15 percent of his looks are coming at the rim this season (7th percentile).Beyond that, Middleton has all the trimmings of an offensive nerve center. The Bucks aren\\'t the Bucks without their capacity to navigate minutes sans Antetokounmpo. Middleton is central to that independence. Milwaukee outscores opponents by 8.1 points per 100 possessions during his solo stints with an offensive rating that ranks in the 94th percentile.Ebbing offensive efficiency is a threat to Jimmy Butler\\'s place in this exercise. His 24.8 percent clip from three is the second-lowest of his career, and among 111 players attempting at least three pull-up jumpers per game, his 33.8 effective field-goal percentage ranks...110th.To his credit, Butler has supplemented struggles from the perimeter with relentless assaults on the basket. A staggering 43 percent of his looks are coming at the rim, his highest share since 2012-13. Defenses are still inclined to overreact when he gets going downhill, and he is an expert at both creating and finishing through contact. He ranks in the 100th percentile of shooting foul percentage.Butler has further counteracted his spiraling outside clips with additional playmaking. His 6.1 dimes per game are a career high, and he places inside the top 25 of potential assists. The Miami Heat are at their scariest when he\\'s captaining fast breaks.Even in a down shooting season—his crunch-time splits aren\\'t pretty—Butler has proved to be more than essential. The Heat need every ounce of the pressure he puts on defenses off the dribble. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn are the closest they come to face-up alternatives, which won\\'t cut it. Miami\\'s offensive rating takes a nosedive whenever Butler is on the bench.And more so than anyone else, Butler deserves credit for keeping the Heat afloat on defense.They started fizzling by December but have stayed above board when he\\'s in the game—no small ask given how much time he spent in lineups with three negative defenders prior to the trade deadline. Playing beside Bam Adebayo, Mr. Happy Feet himself, barely qualifies as a luxury under those circumstances.This season was always going to be a test of Butler\\'s stardom—of whether he, at age 30 and independent of another top-25 player (Adebayo isn\\'t there...yet), guaranteed his team a playoff spot. It turns out he does.Year 1 as a Los Angeles Laker couldn\\'t have gone much better for Anthony Davis so far.His per-game numbers of 26.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.4 blocks and 1.5 steals, in concert with L.A.\\'s Western Conference-leading 49-14 record, has AD all the way up to fourth in Basketball Reference\\'s 2019-20 MVP Tracker.The chemistry between him and LeBron James—who trails only Giannis Antetokounmpo in that tracker—seems instantaneous.The Lakers are plus-10.4 points per 100 possessions (95th percentile) when AD and LeBron share the floor. LeBron passing to AD is the most prolific assist combo in the league. And the three-time champion has had no issue deferring to Davis when both are in the game.In those situations, the big man\\'s usage percentage is 26.7. And he trails\\xa0only Joel Embiid and LaMarcus Aldridge in post-ups per game.The knock against Davis, of course, is that the Lakers are minus-0.9 points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor without LeBron. And the defense is dreadful for those possessions.That may be a bit nitpicky, though, as his time in New Orleans probably taught us he\\'s not the kind of player who can singlehandedly carry a team to above-average play.Instead, he may be the absolute best No. 2 (he still trails LeBron in usage) in the NBA.Damian Lillard\\'s superstar stock is aided by the anecdotal perhaps more so than any of his peers.This isn\\'t to imply he doesn\\'t have the statistical credentials. He absolutely does. His 28.9 points and 7.8 assists per game are career highs, and they come on a personal-best true shooting percentage (61.9). Larry Bird, James Harden and Michael Jordan are the only other players to hit those benchmarks for an entire season.Really think about it, and this is sort of absurd. Superstars in their prime reach new peaks, but the means by which Lillard has gotten there is different. He has improved incrementally almost each and every season, adding new wrinkles to his game at a stage of his career when many are settled in their ways and focused on maintenance rather than expansion.Getting swept by the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the 2018 playoffs motivated him to improve his decision-making versus double-teams. This year, without a big who can flip up shots and toss passes out of short rolls, he has diversified his own pick-and-roll package. And his finishing around the rim, while still below league average, is more bankable than it has been in most other years.All this time later, Lillard remains the NBA\\'s closest approximation to the best version of Stephen Curry. No one is better on super-deep threes at the moment. He leads the Association in attempts from 29-plus feet, where he\\'s shooting\\xa0a bonkers 41.1 percent. And where others offer a reasonable facsimile, Lillard noticeably separates himself with an actual defensive motor and, most importantly, a certain plug-and-playness.Someone like Trae Young doesn\\'t yet have the luxury of a secondary playmaker who invites him to relinquish control, but you could see other megastars, such as Luka Doncic or James Harden, suffering unintended consequences if tasked with deferring too often. Lillard\\'s style, similar to Curry\\'s, is inoculated against that wart.And yeah, in the grand scheme of things, his intangibles matter. He\\'s among the players who make you believe the clutch gene exists, even when his shots aren\\'t falling. More than that, he is the master at cultivating and preserving culture.For most teams, bringing in both Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside would\\'ve been a notional heat check. For the Portland Trail Blazers, it was business as usual, thanks in largest part to their top-10 superstar and emotional bellwether.What you\\'re about to read might sound like hyperbole, but I assure you: Nikola Jokic is on track to be one of the best centers in NBA history.Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Jokic ranks sixth all-time in box plus/minus, trailing only Michael Jordan Jordan, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Magic Johnson and David Robinson.Before the league was suspended, he was averaging 20.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.7 blocks in just 32.3 minutes per game.This is his fourth season (he\\'s only played five) with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists per 75 possessions.\\xa0No one else has more than three such seasons, and Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and Kevin Garnett are the only players in league history to have at least one.Oscar Robertson and Magic, both of whom averaged more minutes and played in eras with a faster pace, are the only players in league history with more triple-doubles than Jokic before turning 26.The Serbian center fills up stat sheets like few players ever have, and they\\'re not just empty numbers. This season, his\\xa0plus-9.2 net-rating swing ranks in the 93rd percentile (he\\'s never been below the 89th percentile).Before he was selected first-team All-NBA for 2018-19, there was a robust debate over who the game\\'s best center was. With each passing year, Jokic makes it harder to argue against him.Even at seven feet tall, he is functionally Denver\\'s point guard. His vision from anywhere on the floor is unparalleled. He can lead a break or pick apart defenses in the half court. And his passing repertoire is outrageous.He has absurd touch as a scorer, particularly on flip shots and his patented Sombor Shuffle. His footwork in the post hearkens back to the days when big men ruled the league.Defensively, Jokic gets a bad rap because of the lowlights he finds himself in when switched on to much smaller players on the perimeter. No, he\\'s not the most fleet of foot. But generally speaking, he\\'s in the right spots defensively, knows how to take up space without fouling and actually has a very good steal rate, thanks to deceptively quick hands.Denver has allowed fewer points per 100 possessions with Jokic on the floor in each of his five seasons. During his career, his 1.9 defensive box plus/minus is tied for ninth in the NBA.He is, at the very least, an above-average defender. And when you combine that with all-time great offense, you get one of the best players in the world.Can someone knocking down under 32 percent of their threes really be one of the NBA\\'s most valuable shooters? It turns out yes.Luka Doncic\\'s game is not the least bit inefficient. It is just a different brand of efficiency. His 31.8 percent clip from deep comes on absurd volume—9.8 attempts per 36 minutes—and incomprehensible difficulty. Only James Harden and Damian Lillard take a larger share of their triples after using seven or more dribbles, and he\\'s fourth in points scored off unassisted treys, according to PBP Stats.Both the volume and difficulty on Doncic\\'s threes act in service of everyone else. The mere threat of his step-backs and parking-lot range invites defensive attention commanded by, maybe, seven other players. The Dallas Mavericks\\' league-best offense improves by 4.4 points per 100 possessions when he\\'s on the floor (83rd percentile), not by chance but by the openings his long-distance volume creates and the ridiculous on-the-move passes he flings.Awarding Doncic top-five-player status is not an overreaction to his sophomore climb. He has amplified his game to the distress of opposing defenses. His step-back gather is more nonchalant than that of Harden, and he\\'s gotten better at leveraging it into opportunities inside the arc. He\\'s more effective at keeping defenders on his back hip, and he mixes changes in direction with shifts in pace to keep helpers on tilt. (It\\'d be nice to him mix in more of this variety during crunch-time situations.)This variance in attack has coincided with souped-up finishing. Doncic is shooting 73 percent at the rim (94th percentile) and 57.4 percent on all-two pointers. His flip shots are deadly when he\\'s going downhill, and he\\'s pieced together a strong situational post game.That he has both honed and expanded his offensive bag while shouldering even more responsibility is patently ridiculous. Dramatic upticks in volume tend to come at the price of efficiency. Doncic\\'s true shooting percentage has actually jumped roughly four points from his rookie season even though his usage rate has spiked by 6.5.Combine all that with almost unparalleled vision—he\\'s already one of the league\\'s seven best passers—and he has an ironclad case as one of the NBA\\'s top-five players. And he hasn\\'t even technically entered his prime.If watchability debates were a metric for value, James Harden would have no fewer than three unanimous MVP trophies sitting on his mantle.Opinions of his game don\\'t actually matter. The aesthetics are open for interpretation. The results are not.\\xa0Harden has unlocked an alternative means of sustaining efficient offense. He burns through more isolations than entire teams and has standardized the use of step-back threes. The Houston Rockets don\\'t even go through the trouble of sending that many ball screens his way anymore. He doesn\\'t need them. His 1.22 points per isolation possession are the equivalent of a league-best offense on their own.Sitting through this brazen of an approach can be grating for those with no vested interests in Houston\\'s well-being.The possessions aren\\'t always long—the Rockets are second in average possession time, per Inpredictable—but they can be monotonous and, anecdotally, seem to last forever. His search for three-shot fouls and four-point plays is frustrating, if only because both its success and failure lack a consistent baseline. The way he chases—and exaggerates—contact on drives to the basket is equally infuriating for similar reasons and because of what it does to the pace of play.Say what you will about the look of it all, that it\\'s gimmicky or not in the spirit of the game. The Rockets, in their eyes, have spotted a market inefficiency, and they\\'ve elected to ride it, repeatedly, to title contention. Playoff flameouts open them up to criticism, but jockeying for a top-three regular-season finish in the Western Conference every year is nothing to belittle.None of it\\'s possible without Harden. He has broken regular-season defenses, not unlike Stephen Curry, only on the back of harder-to-love extremes. Focusing too much on the pretense of Harden\\'s invention risks underselling the significance of what he\\'s doing: scoring like hell, to the tune of 34.4 points per game on unreal efficiency.For anyone who can\\'t appreciate that, perhaps they can at least muster affection for his playmaking. Harden has achieved absolute awareness in the half court and throws some of the league\\'s most mind-meltingly difficult passes.Because, obviously, scoring like hell isn\\'t enough.Kawhi Leonard\\'s best-player-in-the-league case keeps receiving convincing bumps.Winning a second title and Finals MVP last year was the peak of his argument. That he wound up leaving the Toronto Raptors partially added to the intrigue. This wasn\\'t him emerging from the shadows of his Hall of Fame teammates. It was him spearheading an entire championship push in a one-off situation while playing through a left knee injury that became progressively worse as the postseason soldiered on.Not that he needed it, but Leonard\\'s second title legitimized him in a way 2013-14\\'s banner year never needed to, a measuring stick for just how unfathomably far his offensive game had come. The Raptors put him at the center of their universe, and it worked.Leonard\\'s performance this season, on yet another new team, has amplified his cause, resetting his career peak once more. The Los Angeles Clippers opened the year leaning on him for extreme pick-and-roll usage. That volume has come down from its initial high, but it still makes up roughly one-third of Leonard\\'s offensive possessions, by far and away the largest share of his career.Cooking more initiation into his routine has given way to the long-anticipated playmaking surge. Leonard doesn\\'t toss the same fancy-schmancy passes James Harden and LeBron James do, but he\\'s successfully leveraging the chaos he inflicts into gimme opportunities for his teammates.Defenses regress into ataxic clutter when he maneuvers inside the arc, and so many opponents are predisposed to show double-teams as soon as he catches the ball outside the rainbow. The attention he draws, verging on panic, is the turbine Los Angeles uses to power its offense. Leonard is averaging a career-high 5.6 assists per 36 minutes, and the Clippers are scoring 116.8 points per 100 possessions (93rd percentile) when he plays without Paul George and Lou Williams.Driving an entire offense as the primary facilitator is Leonard\\'s final frontier, the last step in his quest, be it deliberate or incidental, to become the NBA\\'s most complete player.His progression as a scorer already gave him a stake in that conversation before now.\\xa0He swishes pull-up mid-rangers on autopilot, and his bullish drives to the basket render defenders who aren\\'t built like houses mostly helpless. His off-the-bounce three is on the come-down, but teams still respect it, and he remains lights-out off the catch.That someone can be so utterly assertive on offense—30.0 points per 36 minutes on 58.5 percent true shooting—while guarding at an All-NBA level is beyond comprehension. Leonard doesn\\'t exhaust his defensive stores on every possession, thus creating negligible separation between himself and Giannis Antetokounmpo. But the engagement and resolve he\\'s sustained for the latter half of this season are truly, totally terrifying.LeBron James\\' will should be showing signs of erosion at age 35—something, anything, that suggests he is exiting his prime.So much for thatFor whatever reason—and there are many—he seems further away from his twilight than last season. Whether it\\'s the arrival of Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers\\' proximity to a title, a disdain for the push to inaugurate Giannis Antetokounmpo or Kawhi Leonard as the league\\'s best player or some combination of everything, LeBron is carrying himself with a renewed sense of purpose and swagger.That fresh approach is most evident on the defensive end. He isn\\'t checking fellow superstars every night, but he\\'s openly more engaged in the half-court. His close-outs on shooters have more pep, in that he\\'s actually closing out on shooters, and he\\'s fighting through screens with intent, enough to help Los Angeles coax ball-handlers into long mid-range jumpers and keep them from working the corners.Much is made of the Lakers offense in LeBron\\'s absence, and correctly so. They are short no fewer than one ball-handler. But the defense has, statistically, suffered more when he\\'s off the court. That\\'s not telltale of anything groundbreaking. It also isn\\'t purely a function of his spending so much time beside Davis and Danny Green.On offense, meanwhile, LeBron still emits inevitability. What he wants to do gets done.Just as he developed a post game in Miami and added a step-back three into his ammunition depot last season, he has decided that now, in Year 17, is the time to win the league\\'s assist crown. It is this added influence over the offense that allows him to hold off the stars most closely at his heels—namely Kawhi Leonard.Players have rarely churned out 25-point, 10-assist detonations so regularly, much less at LeBron\\'s age. He has six years on anyone else who maintained those averages for an entire season. What he\\'s doing now isn\\'t natural. Yet watching him, it looks and feels organic.In truth, that\\'s LeBron\\'s career arc in a nutshell. He has normalized, even numbed us to, what isn\\'t. Someday, he\\'ll cease contending for MVPs and best-player-alive honors. That time isn\\'t now. What\\'s more, it doesn\\'t appear to be on the horizon, either.This might be the easiest call of this project. Giannis isn\\'t just the NBA\\'s best power forward in 2019-20, he is having an all-time great campaign, regardless of position.His 11.5 box plus/minus is the ninth-best single-season mark in NBA history.\\xa0LeBron James (three times), Michael Jordan (three times), Stephen Curry and David Robinson are the only players with better seasons by that mark.And while the per-game numbers—29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks—that underlie that box plus/minus are eye-popping, they still don\\'t do this season justice.Like Curry and the Golden State Warriors in 2015-16, Giannis hasn\\'t needed to play a ton of minutes for his team to put games away early. For the season, he is averaging just 30.9 minutes per game.His per-75-possession numbers—32.9 points, 15.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks—are literally unprecedented. And no one\\'s all that close.That seemingly impossible individual production for a 53-12 team suggests Giannis should win MVP in a landslide. The aforementioned tracker agrees.For the reigning winner of that honor, the real prize might be Defensive Player of the Year. If he secured both awards, Giannis would join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to pull that off.In addition to his 12.7 defensive rebounds (first this season and third-most all time), 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions,\\xa0Milwaukee allow\\xa011.3 fewer points per 100 possessions when Giannis is on the floor, giving him a defensive rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.For further context, the Bucks allow just 97.7 points per 100 possessions when Giannis plays. The league average defensive rating this season is 110.4.Not only is Giannis one of the most nightmarish (for opponents) point forwards the league has ever seen, he\\'s a versatile defensive anchor who can guard multiple positions.If his still-developing jump shot ever truly arrives, it might be impossible to even imagine a 4 more perfectly suited for the modern NBA.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Unless otherwise noted, stats courtesy of\\xa0NBA.com,\\xa0Basketball Reference\\xa0or\\xa0Cleaning the Glass.Andy Bailey and Dan Favale cover the NBA for Bleacher Report.

       " 'RANKED: The 14 best players in the NBA right nowThe 2020-21 NBA season is about haflway through, and we have three months of basketball to consider when analyzing the best players in the league.We first made this ranking before the season tipped off. While LeBron James still tops our list — it\\'s hard to argue against the reigning Finals MVP and longest-running dominant player in the league — our order has changed a bit, thanks to some MVP-worthy seasons this year.Check out the 14 best players in the NBA today.Honorable mentions:\\xa0Bradley Beal, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, Devin Booker, Khris Middleton, Donovan Mitchell, Rudy Gobert\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Jayson Tatum.\\n                            \\n\\n                                Nick Wass/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: Boston CelticsPosition: ForwardAge: 23Previous ranking:\\xa0132020-21 stats: 24.9 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 43.7% FG, 36.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Tatum made \"The Leap\" in 2019-20. His progress in 2020-21 hasn\\'t been as great, but he is also recovering from COVID-19. Few players possess Tatum\\'s three-level scoring ability, and he has improved as a playmaker and a defender. The list of players you\\'d take before Tatum when starting a franchise is short.Team: LA ClippersPosition: ForwardAge: 30Previous ranking: n/a2020-21 stats: 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 49.9% FG, 45% 3FGWhere he stands right now: George had a rough showing in the NBA\\'s bubble, but has come out with a vengeance this season. He is having his most efficient scoring season of his career while averaging a career-high in assists per game and playing his usual solid defense. The Clippers have destroyed opponents with George on the floor, outscoring them by 12 points per 100 possessions.Team: Miami HeatPosition: Guard/ForwardAge: 31Previous ranking:\\xa0112020-21 stats: 20.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 1.9 steals, 45.4% FG, 23.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Butler doesn\\'t always fit the profile of an elite player because of his lack of shooting and occasional hesitancy to score. But just five other players this season are averaging 20-7-7 per game. Butler is averaging career-highs in rebounds and assists all while playing his usual stout defense, and the Heat are 14-8 with him in the lineup. Let\\'s not forget that he\\'s just a few months removed from a dominant postseason run where he went toe-to-toe with LeBron James in the Finals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Luka Doncic.\\n                            \\n\\n                                Matt Slocum/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: Dallas MavericksPosition: Guard/ForwardAge: 22Previous ranking:\\xa092020-21 stats: 28.6 points, 8.4 rebounds, 9.0 assists, 47.8% FG, 31.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Doncic\\'s efficiency is up and his usage is down slightly. Some consider him an MVP candidate. So why did his ranking fall? Doncic started the season slow, coming into training camp out of shape and struggling with efficiency. In the meantime, his Mavericks struggled out of the gate while Doncic faced critiques about complaining to refs and poor attitude. His play has ticked up lately, and his team has followed suit. Don\\'t worry, Mavs fans: it feels like a matter of time until Doncic is a consensus top-three player.Team: Portland Trail BlazersPosition: GuardAge: 30Previous ranking:\\xa0102020-21 stats: 29.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 8.0 assists, 44.5% FG, 38.4% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Lillard is showing his value this year, carrying a battered Blazers squad missing three projected starters. Lillard rises to the occasion like no one else in the NBA: he is second in points scored in the \"clutch\" — defined as the last five minutes of a game with the score within five points — with a ridiculous 63-58-100 shooting line. The Blazers are 14-5 in those situations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Stephen Curry.\\n                            \\n\\n                                Tony Gutierrez/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: Golden State WarriorsPosition: GuardAge: 32Previous ranking: 82020-21 stats: 29.7 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 47.8% FG, 41.1% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Curry has re-established himself as one of the NBA\\'s elite players in perhaps stronger fashion than most would have anticipated. He\\'s carrying a so-so Warriors roster to playoff contention all while scoring at near career-best levels. No player carries more gravity when he steps on the court, and Curry\\'s unique ability to play off the ball supports the players around him.Team: Brooklyn NetsPosition: GuardAge: 312020-21 stats: 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 11.1 assists, 48.4% FG, 40% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Rejuvenated in Brooklyn, Harden has tweaked his game from all-encompassing offensive engine to, well, just playing point guard. The step-back threes and line-drives to the rim are still there, but Harden has also willingly dished the ball to teammates and selflessly advanced the ball on fastbreaks to drive the Nets offense. The Nets\\' plethora of offensive weapons makes it a bit harder to separate Harden\\'s brilliance from circumstance, but he\\'s nonetheless thriving with a change of scenery.Team: Los Angeles LakersPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 27Previous ranking: 42020-21 stats: 22.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.9 blocks, 53.3% FG, 29.3% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Davis got off to a puzzling slow start to the season and has only played in two games since early February because of an Achilles issue. We\\'re betting the slow start is an aberration and Davis will return to the floor ready to carry the Lakers in stretch run. Perhaps the best two-way player in the NBA, Davis combines elite rim protection with a varied offensive game that extends comfortably to the three-point line. At his best, he is a problem opponents can\\'t solve.Team: Denver NuggetsPosition: CenterAge: 26Previous ranking:\\xa072020-21 stats: 27.1 points, 11 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 56.7% FG, 41.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Jokic is on the periphery of two incredible statistical groups, and he\\'s doing it at the same time: averaging a triple-double with a 50-40-90 shooting line. No one has ever done both. The stats are just a glimpse at one of the league\\'s most dominant offensive players. Jokic is more aggressive than ever, willingly shooting threes, bullying opponents in the post, and even dunking. When he\\'s not looking for his shot, he\\'s whipping one-handed assists around the court and serving as the fulcrum of the Nuggets offense. Denver has under-performed this season, but not because of Jokic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Joel Embiid.\\n                            \\n\\n                                Matt Slocum/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: Philadelphia 76ersPosition: CenterAge: 26Previous ranking: 122020-21 stats: 30.2 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.3 blocks, 52.1% FG, 41.6% 3FGWhere he stands right now: We\\'ve always wanted to see peak Embiid — here he is. The frontrunner for the MVP is in the best shape of his life, scoring more efficiently than ever, all while holding down the middle for the best team in the East. The question is if Embiid can carry it over a full season and into the playoffs, but he is currently prime Shaq with a more diverse offensive game.Team: Milwaukee BucksPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 26Previous ranking:\\xa052020-21 stats: 29 points, 11.7 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 55.7% FG, 28.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Antetokounmpo and the Bucks haven\\'t consistently found their groove this season. It says a lot that the two-time, reigning MVP\\'s slow start has him putting up almost identical numbers to his last two seasons. Antetokounmpo\\'s outside shot still evades him, but his defense hasn\\'t taken a break and he has improved as a playmaker. Players like Embiid and Jokic are threatening to pass him,\\xa0 but let\\'s give it a full season before dropping Antetokounmpo.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Kawhi Leonard and Kevin Durant.\\n                            \\n\\n                                Kathy Willens/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: LA ClippersPosition: ForwardAge: 29Previous ranking: 32020-21 stats: 26.6 points, 6.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists, 51.1% FG, 38.7% 3FGWhere he stands right now:\\xa0 Leonard is a two-way wrecking ball who can function as the leading scorer on a championship team and has continued to improve his playmaking each year. Last year\\'s Clippers team fell well short of their goals, but they are once again dominant with Leonard on the floor this season. After a blazing-hot start to the season, Leonard\\'s shooting has cooled off slightly. Expect Leonard to kick things up a notch in the stretch run and postseason.Team: Brooklyn NetsPosition: ForwardAge: 32Previous ranking:\\xa022020-21 stats: 29 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 52.4% FG, 43.4% 3FGWhere he stands right now: You wouldn\\'t know Durant missed over a year of basketball recovering from a torn Achilles, one of the toughest injuries in basketball. The smooth jumper, quick first step, and ability to read the floor and turn it up on defense when needed are all still there. Durant had likely become the best overall player in the NBA from 2017-2019 before suffering his injury in the 2019 Finals. Health is still a big question, as he\\'s played just 19 games this season, but when he\\'s been on the floor, he\\'s been as dominant as ever\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              LeBron James.\\n                            \\n\\n                                David Zalubowski/AP Images\\n                              \\n\\nTeam: Los Angeles LakersPosition: Guard/ForwardAge: 36Previous ranking:\\xa012019-20 stats: 25.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 50.9% FG, 35.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: How is this still happening? James is past the point at which he should still be an All-Star-caliber player, let alone an MVP-caliber player. He\\'s lost a step physically, but is still a masterful chess player, arranging the court to his will to pick apart defenses. He led the league in assists last year for the first time in his career, at age 35. And when it comes to the postseason, his track record says it all — nine Finals appearances and four championships in 10 years. There may be more spritely, explosive players today, but in a must-win game, there isn\\'t someone you\\'d take over James.\\n                          Keep reading\\n                        ',\n",
