So without further ado, here below is a list of the top 50 most-submitted Marvel comics from 2015 (census numbers are as of year-end 2016).

      "NBA Top 100 Players 2021-2022 | Ranking The Best Basketball Players & Prop BetsPosted: Oct 31, 2021Last updated: Feb 8, 2022The NBA’s 75th season is just around the corner, as the 2021-22 campaign is set to begin Tuesday, October 19. Starting off the action is a matchup between last year’s Eastern Conference heavyweights — the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks — followed by a meeting between the Golden State Warriors and new-look Los Angeles Lakers.In preparation for the upcoming year, we at The Game Day took the liberty of ranking the top 100 players in the NBA. This was no easy list to compile given the vast amount of talent across the league, and do note that it is entirely subjective.Additionally, if you’re looking to place a few preseason player and team prop bets before the games are underway, you’ve come to the right place. Below, you’ll find some of our favorite picks mixed into the NBA Top 100 list, including a few major NBA award winners.With that said, let’s dive right in.Looking to bet on the NBA this season?

Although the high-scoring point guard isn’t the player he once was with the Charlotte Hornets, New York clearly upgraded at the position by bringing him in.A native of the Bronx, Walker will be welcomed with open arms by Knicks fans hoping to see their team make consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 2013.If Walker proves to be a solid fit in Tom Thibodeau‘s system alongside Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, New York should have no issue returning to the postseason despite playing in a surprisingly crowded Eastern Conference.prop bet Bet $20, Payout $33Kemba Walker could experience a renaissance year with his hometown New York Knicks in 2021-22. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Toronto Raptors forward OG Anunoby is one of the most popular picks to win Most Improved Player in 2021-22, and it’s not hard to see why. The 24-year-old has made large strides in each of his first four NBA seasons, but he feels especially primed to have a breakout year.With Kyle Lowry out of the picture, someone on this Raptors team needs to step up and become the go-to guy. Pascal Siakam floundered when given the opportunity last year, and Fred VanVleet isn’t a No. 1 option.That leaves the up-and-coming Anunoby, a rock-solid two-way wing with an improved shooting touch and hunger for the spotlight. If he can lead the Raptors back to the playoffs in 2022 after a disappointing year in Tampa Bay, his name will be rightfully be at the forefront of the conversation.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $420A breakout season could be on the horizon for Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)The Chicago Bulls are going to be a ton of fun this season. Zach LaVine‘s monstrous season wasn’t enough to carry them into the postseason in 2020-21, but with the help the franchise got him this offseason, Chicago may be a virtual shoo-in this year.In addition to acquiring Nikola Vučević at the trade deadline, the Bulls also added DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball via free agency, building one of the more talented starting rotations in the NBA in the process.With that said, it should be known that this is still LaVine’s team. The high-flying guard averaged 27.4 points per game on near-50/40/90 splits in 2020-21, and the additions of DeRozan and Ball should lead to more open looks.Expect LaVine to lead the Bulls to their first postseason appearance since 2017 — and look for them to rack up plenty of wins along the way.over-under Bet $20, Payout $38The Chicago Bulls look like one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference on paper, but will it translate to success on the court? (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Kevin Durant put together one of the best seasons of his career in 2020-21, and that’s saying a lot considering the 33-year-old is a former MVP, 11x All-Star, and 4x Scoring Champion. Durant was as efficient as ever in his debut year with the Brooklyn Nets, pouring in 26.9 points per game and shooting a career-high 45% from three-point range.However, where the Slim Reaper really brought his A-game was in the playoffs, where he averaged an absurd 34.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. He was at his best in Brooklyn’s Game 5 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, putting together a 49-point triple-double in one of the single-greatest playoff performances in NBA history.To put it simply, there’s no stopping KD. As long as he can stay healthy this year and keep his production up, there won’t be anybody standing in the way of him earning his second Most Valuable Player award.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $160\n",

Betting Impact:Despite Villanova's dominance in this series, the Jayhawks are -4.5 point favorites, per BettingPros consensus odds. This point spread is slightly up from an initial opening of -4, and the movement may be due to the verification that Wildcats second-leading scorer, Justin Moore, will miss the game after suffering a torn Achilles against Houston. Villanova has covered the spread in all four NCAA Tournament games thus far, and are 21-6 ATS in its last 27 tournament games overall. Kansas is 6-2 ATS in its last eight games, but has covered just two of its last seven NCAA Tournament games. The underdog has covered the spread in four of the last five meetings between these teams. The Duke Blue Devils have been bet up from -4 to -4.5 point favorites for their Sweet 16 matchup against the North Carolina Tar Heels, per BettingPros consensus odds.\n",
      "Betting Impact:North Carolina is making its 21st Final Four appearance, the most all-time. While North Carolina extends its record for most Final Four appearances, Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski makes a record 13th Final Four appearance, passing John Wooden for the most all-time. Krzyzewski is also the tenth head coach to make a Final Four in his last season. The Blue Devils went 1-1 SU and ATS in two regular-season meetings against the Tar Heels. North Carolina has covered the spread in all four NCAA Tournament games, and Duke has covered its last three, which followed a span of seven consecutive NCAA Tournament games where it did not cover the spread. The over/under has much more volatility than the point spread, as some sportsbooks are as low as 150.5 points and as high as 151.5. The two regular-season meetings between Duke and North Carolina totaled 154 and 175 points, each cashing the over. The over is 5-2 in North Carolina’s last seven games as underdogs and 8-2 in Duke’s previous ten. The Duke-North Carolina game is likely to have the biggest handle of any college basketball game this season, and sportsbooks are likely expecting the majority of the betting public to back the Blue Devils. \n",
      "Leading up to Saturday's Final Four, the Duke Blue Devils have the best odds of all four teams to win the national championship. Betting Impact:Per DraftKings, each team's odds to win the national championship are as follows: Duke (+155), Kansas (+185), Villanova (+450), North Carolina (+500). The Blue Devils and Jayhawks have -195 and -180 ML odds, respectively, to win their Final Four matchups. If they do, it would set up a nostalgic rematch in Mike Krzyzewski's last game, as he beat Kansas in 1991 for his first-ever national championship. The Kansas Jayhawks have opened as -6 point favorites for their Elite Eight matchup against the Miami Hurricanes, with an O/U of 147.5 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Betting Impact:The Miami Hurricanes earned their first-ever Elite Eight appearance with a dominating 14-point victory over Iowa State. Combined with Saint Peter’s deep run, their win makes it ten of the past 11 NCAA Tournaments where at least one No. 7 seed or lower has reached the Elite Eight. Kansas’ Sweet 16 victory over Providence was also historic, as it was the Jayhawks’ 2,354th win, breaking a tie with Kentucky for the most wins in Division I. This is now Bill Self’s 11th career Elite Eight appearance and ninth as Jayhawks head coach. As the lone remaining No. 1 seed, Kansas kept the streak alive that at least one No. 1 seed has made the Elite Eight in every NCAA Tournament since seeding began in 1979. However, this is the first time fewer than two No. 1 seeds have made the Regional Finals since 2013. Kansas has been favored in all but one of its 38 games this season. The Jayhawks have failed to cover their last two games, which followed a streak of five consecutive covers. Miami has covered four straight games and six of its previous seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saint Peter's Peacocks are the first-ever No. 15 seed to advance to the Elite Eight, and will look to continue making history as underdogs against the North Carolina Tar Heels. Betting Impact:The Tar Heels are -8 point favorites with an O/U of 137 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Before this year's Peacocks team, the lowest seed ever to make an Elite Eight was a No. 12 seed (2002 Missouri, 2021 Oregon State). Conversely, the North Carolina Tar Heels are making their 27th Elite Eight appearance and first since 2017. North Carolina advanced to the Elite Eight with a 73-66 win over UCLA. The victory was UNC's 17th straight over Pac-12 teams. While not as improbable as Saint Peter's run, North Carolina had to win two of three tournament games as underdogs to be in this position. The Tar Heels improved to 10-4 SU all-time as a No. 8 seed and reached the Final Four as a No. 8 seed in 2000. Hubert Davis is now the fifth head coach to make an Elite Eight appearance in his first season as a D-I head coach, and first since Stan Heath in 2002. Saint Peter's entered the NCAA Tournament as the best ATS team of any in the 68-team field, and now three straight wins and covers have improved its ATS record to 23-9. At most sportsbooks, Saint Peter's was 10,000:1 to win the national championship before the tournament. The Peacocks are the only team to win multiple games as a double-digit underdog in an NCAA Tournament since the tournament expanded in 1985. From 1985-2021, double-digit favorites in the Sweet 16 went 35-2 SU but went 0-2 this year after Saint Peter's win over Purdue and Arkansas' win over Gonzaga. Saint Peter's outright win over Purdue as +13 point underdogs was the biggest Sweet 16 upset since 1978.If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, please call 1-800-GAMBLER.All betting content on TheGameDay.com is exclusively intended for audience members 21 years and older who are permitted to gamble in legal states.

      "Best DC Comics of 2019Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJune 28, 2019 by Dave 1 Comment 2019 has been a challenging year for DC Comics, with operational changes leading to layoffs throughout the publishing arm, and high profile series like Heroes in Crisis suffering from extensively negative reviews. Many of the publisher’s most memorable 2019 events are exercises in crisis control, from Batman: Damned‘s “Bat-Penis” controversy (see also: sentences I’ve always dreamed of writing) to the early removal of Tom King from Batman.Even with this, DC has published plenty of great stories, and continues to build an impressive network of top tier creative talent. Since acquiring Brian Michael Bendis from Marvel in 2018 (it wasn’t actually a sports style trade, but I prefer to phrase it that way), DC has also added the following list of heavy hitters:This is on top of pre-existing universe architects like King, Geoff Johns, and Scott Snyder (among many others!).The end result is a seemingly endless stream of ongoings and miniseries on my pull list of comics I collect week in and week out. We’re entering year 4 of the DC Rebirth era, and that’s an admittedly difficult spot to be – the thrill of the “new” has worn off, and now DC faces a lot of questions about what they want their universe to look like for the long haul.These are the comics that are doing it best in 2019.Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!This is a borderline best-of for me because in many ways Aquaman still feels more like a draft prospect than a fully fleshed out player – even with complete arcs published, the creative vision of Deconnick and Robson Rocha feels like a lot of untapped potential.But oh that potential! There’s plenty of interesting world-building occurring in the early parts of Deconnick’s time writing an amnesiac Arthur Curry, and Rocha’s approach to storytelling makes for a visually compelling comic. I definitely think the best is yet to come on Aquaman, but even so, it remains one of the more interesting DC Comics of the year.If you’re surprised to find Hawkman among DC’s best of 2019, well, so was I. Nonetheless, Robert Vendetti and Bryan Hitch have been hard at work on (arguably) DC’s most underrated title, spinning the return of Carter Hall (via DC Metal) into an extremely fresh take on the complicated character.After an inconsistent run on Justice League to kick off DC Rebirth, Hitch is back to conveying incredibly cinematic visuals on the page, as he and Vendetti lean into Hawkman’s roots as an archaeologist. I don’t exaggerate when saying this is the most I’ve ever liked Carter Hall.It hasn’t received even a fraction of the hype, but Female Furies is a worthy companion piece to Tom King and Mitch Gerad’s Mister Miracle. Making Granny Goodness a sympathetic figure, and a clear target of an inherent patriarchy at the center of Apokolips is no easy chore, and Female Furies not only succeeds, but entertains while doing so.Through the six issue miniseries, Cecil Castelluci and Adriana Melo dig into the harsh realities of the Furies fighting force, and the characters of Big Barda, Aurelie, Mad Harriet, Lashina, Bernadeth and Stompa. It’s an untapped corner of Apokoliptin myth, with a whip-smart layer of contemporary commentary.Following work on The Flintstones, Snagglepuss, and DC’s Nuclear Winter Special, writer Mark Russell is an “auto pull” in my comics rotation. Russell’s brand of satire and humanism resonates deeply, and although I have absolutely zero nostalgic connection to The Wonder Twins, the prospect of Russell on such an odd piece of DC history was instantly tantalizing.Stephen Byrne’s art is perfectly suited for this high school setting, and Wonder Twins manages to wrangle Super Friends nostalgia into an extremely relevant story for 2019.Ever since Captain America 3: Civil War hit theaters, I’ve said it’s a fool’s errand to question the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Pulling off a movie of that scale, with that many moving pieces proved to me once and for all that the creative players involved were a near lock on a quality offering (and that was before we saw the true scale in Infinity War).That’s also how I’ve come to feel about comics written by Tom Taylor. No matter how outlandish the premise (a videogame were Superman goes Tyrant-mode or a Wolverine series featuring a *gasps* real live girl!) Taylor delivers some of the best superhero comics available.DCeased pulls that trick off yet again, this time with a “Marvel Zombies” style exploration of the DC Universe. While I still wish this was an in continuity event (let Taylor get wild, you cowards!), the freedom to explore free from continuity opens a lot of storytelling doors.The thing about this comic is that Matt Fraction (Sex Criminals, Hawkeye) and Steve Lieber (Superior Foes of Spider-Man) are responsible, and every indication is that it *should*  be one for the ages. Even with a limited sample available, I can say I unequivocally love “Superman’s Pal, Jimmy Olsen.” It’s hilarious, and inventive, and explores way more of the DC Universe than I expected.Above all else, Jimmy Olsen is challenging, zigzagging between eras and plotlines with reckless abandon, leaving only your faith in a guiding hand to keep the story from unraveling. Fraction and Lieber seem intent on ensuring all twelve issues of the series are in your hands before any accurate assessment can be levied, which certainly has both pros and cons. As a result, I’ve softened mildly on my assumptions that this would be my favorite DC Comic of 2019, and now find it merely quite good, with the possibility that I’ll have a spot for the completed work here again in 2020!A Green Lantern comic by the creative team of Grant Morrison and Liam Sharp is one of those sure bets that I could feel comfortable including on a best-of list sight unseen.I’m pulling and reading issue every issue the moment they’re released, but I’m just saying, my confidence in Morrison and Sharp is that high.Since Morrison has a history with the DC Universe dating back to the late 80’s, The Green Lantern is also held to the standard of his past work, which increases the complexity of evaluation. Ultimately I know this take on Hal Jordan, space cop is compared to some of the greatest runs in DC history. The looming shadow of reports that this is Morrison’s final superhero comic (we’ll see) also offer some legacy gravitas to a series that stands out regardless.I’ve written extensively in a “Previously On” column why I love “The Wild Storm” by Warren Ellis and Jon Davis-Hunt. I’ll add here that 2019 has been especially exciting as it houses the conclusion of this 24 issue narrative, and that the slow-burn is paying off in tremendous ways. Ellis and Davis-Hunt have effectively ramped up to “The Authority” portion of the proceedings, which means reimagined Jenny Sparks, Midnighter and Apollo (among others).It’s a contemporary masterclass in updating a shared universe and Jon Davis-Hunt is doing some of the best work in superhero comics. Plus, you can read all 24 issues right now, and have a full sense of story completion!Gene Luen Yang is one of the surest creative bets in comics, and his all ages work with artist Gurihiru is an instant classic, both an homage to Superman’s deep history and much-needed socio-political reflection of the Superman myth’s place in 2019.The oversized three issue book has quickly become one of my most eagerly anticipated releases, and even with the final third yet to be released in 2020, there’s no doubt that Superman Smashes The Klan is a remarkable testament to how effective true all ages works from the Big 2 can be in the right creative hands.The world of Batman is an unsurprisingly crowded realm this year, with all sorts of creative powerhouses taking their turn at the caped crusader. In Batman, Tom King is unveiling his years in the making love-story, in “Detective Comics” writer Peter Tomasi is taking the iconic title in a new direction, in “Batman Who Laughs” Scott Snyder and Jock reunite for a Dark Nights Metal spinoff, and in “Batman Universe” Brian Michael Bendis and Nick Derington are giving the Walmart faithful gorgeous Bat-adventures.And that’s before we get to “Black Label,” which is apparently going to be nothing but a Batman U showcase!Above all, though, I’m most excited for Batman: Last Knight on Earth which reunites New 52 Batman and Dark Nights Metal creative combo Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo. Snyder and Capullo have described the oversized three issue collection as their Dark Knight Returns, and they’re not overselling the goods. “Last Knight on Earth” is a post-apocalyptic / Mad Max style narrative in which Bruce Wayne awakens in a surreal DC Universe gone wrong and sets to make things right.Rather than lean in to the grim situation, Snyder and Capullo have fun with the premise, giving Batman a Joker-head to carry around on his newfound, perhaps final quest. It’s a gorgeous looking comic with all the absolute comic book conceptual joy of Metal.If you only read one comic book series in the DC Universe in 2019, make it Batman: Last Knight on Earth!Filed Under: Featured Tagged With: best of 2019, DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Chris J says September 14, 2019 at 9:59 pmWell, overall I can’t fault your choices as they are ‘your preferences’. However, I have to say that DC has long since disenfranchised me from their fold, something I’ve been somewhat loathe to admit having been a fan of their characters since the 50s and 60s. And, having been a fan, a comics artist and storyteller, back issue dealer, comic book store manager, and even having worked as a sales manager for a small comics publisher in the past (Viz), my perspective is rooted in a breadth of perspectives and experience. It’s not better than yours, but also lends itself more, perhaps of a longer perspective.While I might still be attracted to some DC characters and ever so hopeful, there have been so many missteps in the past ten years (and this also by accounts includes Marvel as well) that I no longer really…care about the characters. I bear that excuse and decision. Do I blame DC? No, I guess they’re doing the best they can in an exceedingly difficult publishing environment, and I have little doubt that the corporate folks who engineered the move to LA and are no doubt more bottom-line concerned has put the fear of god (getting fired, not achieving better sales, etc.) into the existing administrative/editorial pool that the general consensus of publishing is now based as much on focus groups, appealing to the middle ground, and…let’s face it…playing to the masses rather than…whatever they SHOULD be doing. Obviously, they haven’t figured it out, they’re inan environment where the staff don’t know what to do, and whatever they choose, might bring them all to the exit door. I dunno. I wish them all luck, but I barely recognize any of these characters. Retcons run rampant, rebirths, re-issues, re-starts with #1, crisis this and crisis that, crossovers that literally strip the money out of feeble-minded fans who are addicted and afraid to  miss out…what a mess. Best of luck to them allYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *Comment * Name * Email * Website  \n",

      "50 BEST PLAYERS IN THE NBA\n",
      "\n",
      "There are roughly a million ways to rank and order players in today’s analytically inclined NBA where stats and information can overwhelm those of us who don’t have a degree in quantum physics. Seriously, pick just about any stat or specific skill—like offensive rating, win shares, +/-, or shooting percentage on corner threes—and we can neatly order the 500-plus players who will be on an NBA roster this season into a coherent hierarchy.But when wading into a topic as arbitrary, and often inflammatory, as who are the NBA’s 50 best players, you often reach a state of chaos before ever approaching any sort of consensus. Which, honestly, is the way it should be when the rankings rely largely on the eye test mixed in with a few other factors.While it’s kind of an absurd proposition, of course, to accurately and definitively order basketball’s best players, it’s what we love to do. And we have the chutzpah to tell you that we do it better than anybody else out there. So we’re back, before the start of what we hope is a truly normal basketball season after two straight weird ones, to offer up our annual NBA player rankings.Exhaustively argued and astutely ordered, our readers know ranking the top 50 players in the NBA is a tradition here at Complex Sports. But before wading into this year’s version, you should know that we’ve anointed someone new as basketball’s best. Spoiler alert: the reign of LeBron James as the NBA’s unquestioned No. 1 baller has ended. While LeBron stans and Lakers fans may protest, we expect the majority of readers will not have any issues with our new No. 1. Nor will they have any issues with our top 5. Or probably the top 10. The controversies and complaints start once we get into the teens and we’re prepared to never hear the end of it for placing the forever polarizing Draymond Green on our list yet again.We think you’ll agree with how the majority of our rankings shook out, knowing, of course, that this exercise will forever be rooted in imperfect science. You’ll probably raise a few eyebrows or possibly even curse our name as you scroll through. We get it. We respect it. Just read the reasons why we moved Khris Middleton way up and left a few familiar names from previous seasons off before roasting us on Twitter, please.\n",

      "The 30 Best DC Comics of All-Time, RankedThough I was chomping at the bit to do a “Top 30 Marvel Comics” it turns out there was a great list to that effect in October. But there was no such list for the “Distinguished Competition” on the site, so here we go: these are my top 30 favorite DC comics.As a note, these will include both regular DC superhero comics like Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, as well as several entries from their storied Vertigo imprint. When it gets down to the top ten, don’t be surprised to see significant overlap with our recent “50 Best Graphic Novels of All Time” list.Starting out with one of those imprints, DMZ both feels timeless in its depiction of a divided America and like a narrative and artistic time capsule from the Post-9/11 era of dystopian comics. The story follows a journalist trapped in Manhattan, now the eponymous DMZ between American factions, where the war-torn stories dominating the early 2000s news cycles take on a distinctly American flavor.It would be reductive but not inaccurate to call Longbow Hunters the Dark Knight Returns or Batman: Year One for Green Arrow. It’s a grittier depiction of the character, but with a painterly style that helps distinguish it from others in that genre. It’s stylish and is a solid introduction to those looking to get more into the psyche of Oliver Queen.George Perez’s defining run on Wonder Woman helped cement many of the qualities that are readily identified with the hero today. Gods and Mortals thrusts Wonder Woman into the midst of the drama of the gods and puts her role as a Daughter of Themyscira at the forefront of her journey into the modern world. New Frontier is Darwyn Cooke’s love letter to the Gold and Silver ages of comics, telling a story that interweaves the fictional evolution of the characters post WW2 with the real-world crises from McCarthyism to Jim Crow. It manages to both tell a story about a civil conflict within superheroes between the state-sanctioned ones and vigilantes working in the shadows while managing to never get too bogged down in grittiness and showcasing the best of these characters.Tom King’s run on Batman is good, don’t get me wrong, but it’s his Mister Miracle that’s special. In a lot of ways, Mister Miracle feels like a follow-up to his equally personal and similarly color-scheme’d vision series. Here, New Gods hero Mister Miracle is struggling with his past traumas and his domestic life with his wife and fellow New Gods refugee Big Barda. Like with Vision, Tom King knows how to effectively funnel cosmic sci-fi into a personal family narrative.Scott Snyder is a master of gothic horror, and the Court of Owls villain introduced at the start of his New 52 run may be one of the more iconic entries to Batman’s rogue’s gallery in recent years. Here, a shadowy cabal of masked elites threatens one area Bruce always felt was his strength: his knowledge and understanding of Gotham City. How the mystery unfolds leaves a little to be desired, but all-in-all it’s a compelling Bruce Wayne story that introduces an instant-classic villain.Aquaman’s reputation as a joke hero has always been somewhat undeserved, and nowhere is that status better struck down than in Geoff Johns’ New 52 reboot. Here, Aquaman’s adventures open up an undersea world of court intrigue worthy of Game of Thrones and elements of Lovecraftian horror in the depths of the sea. It’s an exciting, compelling homecoming for the rebooted Arthur Curry.This series doesn’t introduce John Constantine, that honor goes to a book later on this list, but it’s one of the stories that best illustrate the character by dragging him through some of his lowest moments. Here, the chain-smoking British exorcist faces his own mortality as he’s—understandably given the number of cigarettes he inhales—diagnosed with lung cancer. In this Garth Ennis story, Constantine’s life opens up more and readers get to know the man more even as his end seems nigh. It also shows Constantine at his best: dancing around and double-dealing cosmic forces and forever staying just barely one step ahead.In one of the best single-issue stories, a villain traps Superman in an artificial construct by giving him what he’s always dreamed of: a chance to experience life on his homeworld. It’s an interesting conceit that feels like a precursor to the later Elseworlds brand, and culminates with Superman having to give a heartbreaking farewell to a vision of everything he wanted. In just one issue, Alan Moore gets at the heart of the character in a way that few others accomplish.While Year One’s portrayal of Batman and Jim Gordon’s relationship is rightly praised, one of the best aspects of the comic is the repositioning of Batman as “the guy who beats up street-level crooks” -- though don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of that -- to a vigilante willing to take on the wealthy and powerful that others won’t touch. It’s one thing when those are cartoonish businessmen like The Penguin, but Batman: Year One sends its hero after police commissioners and mayors, and gives new nuance to the character’s frequent clashes with authority figures throughout his mythos.The Sinestro Corps War is epic. It marks one of the best occasions where the writers get to let loose and fully embrace the space opera side of the character. Green Lantern Hal Jordan goes toe-to-toe with former comrade turned nemesis Sinestro in an epic battle across the stars. The central conflict is great, but the splintering of the emotional spectrum into multiple Lantern corps was one of the best changes to the character’s mythology in years and helped give the event a lasting weight.The “twist” in Under the Hood is set up in the Hush storyline, but it’s how the mystery unfolds in Under the Hood that’s got the real staying power. A specter of Batman’s past comes back to haunt him and is picking off Gotham’s villains one by one. Like with Court of Owls, Under the Hood also introduces a villain into Batman’s rogues' gallery that became an instant classic. There’s a fair amount made in Batman media about his non-fatal code, but it’s a conflict explored at its best here.This Superman spin on the nature vs nurture debate looks at how the Man of Steel might have been a different hero with just a slight change in the trajectory of the Krypton escape vessel. Here, Superman grows up in Stalin’s Soviet Union, a fact that changes not just his life but ripples out into other heroes and villains across the DC universe. The 1950s Elseworlds versions of the various characters are all fun and interesting, but it’s the character study of Superman’s values that helps make the book so memorable.There’s a lot of good Teen Titans stories, but The Judas Contract is the best and most memorable of Marv Wolfman and George Pérez’s storied run. The Teen Titans are a close-knit team that’s torn apart when a new member is revealed to be a traitor. It was a popular book, but The Judas Contract really put the Teen Titans on the map.It’s not uncommon for characters to get rebooted or reset in one way or another, especially at D.C., but it’s a rare pleasure to watch that happen on the page. In Dennis O'Neil’s run on the question, his own struggles with addiction play out in the noir-infused character. The eponymous hero is beaten nearly to death at the end of the first issue, and much of the rest of the first volume is the character slowly building himself back up from the ground but also questioning what it means to be an investigative hero and some hard questions about the use of violence to that end.Note: sadly the only accessible version of this, at the time of writing, is as single issues on ComixologyPut the ill-fated recent TV show out of your mind, Y: The Last Man is an incredible (and complete) journey following the last man alive on the planet as the world struggles with all the Y-chromosome folks suddenly dropping dead. It’s an interesting premise with a very new order to the world, and as he’d later do with Saga, writer Brian K. Vaughan excels in exploring through that space with a small and very believable cast of characters.Fables, the story of the interwoven lives of various fairy tale denizens living in a magical borough of New York, loses some steam as it goes on. But if it’s a story with some lows, it’s certainly worth reading for its highs. When writer Bill Willingham leans in on the noir or fantasy epic sides of the story, particularly with sections following grizzled sheriff Bigby Wolf, it’s a thrilling ride.The New 52 relaunch had some misses for DC, but where it hit (like Court of Owls and Aquaman) it did so in a big way, and one of those who benefitted the most was Amazonian Diana Prince. Updating and truly living up to the mythological groundwork laid in Gods and Mortals, the New 52 reboot for Wonder Woman adds new wrinkles into her origin and modernizes the Greek pantheon into a compelling urban fantasy series that’s an easy recommendation for any fans of mythology, comics or otherwise.One of the most fun aspects of American Vampire is how willing writer Scott Snyder is to throw out the traditional vampire lore. With various “strains” of vampirism, Snyder throws out the old rules about sunlight and silver in favor of new, wholly American takes on the myth. It’s a decade-hopping tale that starts with a young woman in the Golden Age of Hollywood abused and left for dead, but the story expands over time into a story of grudges and obsessions that span human lifetimes.Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale’s The Long Halloween is widely beloved, but spoiler alert: you won’t find it on this list. For my money, the pair’s best work at DC Comics was Superman for All Seasons. It’s fairly simple as far as Superman stories go, but its strength is in tapping into the minds of the supporting cast closest to Clark Kent. Each of the stories offers a beautiful and well-written perspective on the hero with a masterful, Norman Rockwell-esque visual style that’s Tim Sale at his best. There’s rarely been a more heartfelt encapsulation of the Man of Steel, though there’s at least one better Superman story later on in this list.This won’t be Alan Moore’s last entry in the Top 10, and anyone who has read a “Best of DC” list will understand why. But before… that elephant in the room, Alan Moore breathed new life into the superhero horror character Swamp Thing. The whole run is great, but the first volume’s Ship of Theseus reinvention of the character is a bold and defining turn.The recent love of embracing the silliness of Silver Age villains and humorous juxtaposition against over-the-top violence in media like the Harley Quinn show can, in some ways, be traced back to Gail Simone’s seminal Secret Six. It’s the story of a team of villains with some high body counts, but it’s impossible not to fall in love with the new takes on villains like Bane and Catman that help anchor this dysfunctional team. In arguably the best Batman comic of the last 20 years, Bruce Wayne is nowhere to be found. At a time when Bruce is missing in action, former Robin Dick Grayson steps up to the mantle. But Snyder makes the keen observation that if the villains of Bruce Wayne’s Batman are a reflection of his psyche, then Grayson’s rogue’s gallery would look very different. Black Mirror, impeccably illustrated by artists Jock and Francesco Francavilla, pits Grayson against villains that play with Batman as legacy and generational privilege.To understand what makes Kingdom Come so great, it’s important to have some awareness of what comics were like in the 90s. The anti-hero was all the rage, with the traditional heroes on the wane. Kingdom Come takes that on directly, with a story that poses the question of whether or not there’s still a place in modern comics for characters like Superman or Batman. In doing so, it tells one of the best Elseworlds stories and arguably the greatest Justice League story.Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series is set in some ways inside the D.C. universe, but make no mistake: this is very much a Neil Gaiman story. Preludes and Nocturnes is the launch of Gaiman’s series, but Season of Mists is where Gaiman’s ethereal mythology story truly starts to shine. When Lucifer abdicates his responsibilities in overseeing Hell, a power struggle ensues as various gods try to seize the reins.Grant Morrison’s Superman is possibly the best depiction of the character as Clark Kent faces his own mortality. Morrison whole-heartedly embraces the full history of the character and paints a compelling portrait of what makes Superman an enduring figure. It’s hard to imagine a book that manages to deliver a fitting send-off to a character that’s been around since 1938, but Morrison manages it.In what may be Grant Morrison’s best work, and possibly the best non-Batman story out of D.C., Animal Man is a mind-bending take on the then-neglected Silver Age hero not only breaks through the fourth wall but deconstructs it in many ways. Animal Man is a delightfully bizarre dive into life inside a world where world resets and real-world sales figures can mean life or death to living, breathing characters. However bizarre Morrison’s Animal Man gets, though, it’s steered through by Morrison’s full sincerity and compassion for his characters.If Morrison faced the unenviable task of writing a “last Superman story”, Miller’s task of crafting a “final” Batman story (ignore that there’s a pair of pretty terrible sequels) feels nearly impossible. Miller not only succeeds but helped to redefine the character in ways that cast a long shadow even today. The story follows an elderly Bruce Wayne who emerges from retirement for a few nights to don the cape and cowl one last time in a mission to restore order to Gotham city. As we said in the “Best Graphic Novels” rundown: In all honesty, how could it have been anything else? There are countless blogs devoted to how overrated the comics are, and they’re all wrong. Nearly every issue in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ 12-issue deconstruction of the superhero genre is perfect and genius on some level — particularly The Watchmaker, in which we follow Doctor Manhattan’s non-linear perception of the world. Every issue, every panel, feels carefully crafted and composed.Watchmen’s central mystery, who killed The Comedian, is a compelling hook for a story that dives headfirst into Cold War anxieties and meaningful questions about hero worship. There are few stories that can live up to the kind of reputation Watchmen has earned, but it does.\n",

      "   \t\t\tRanking The Best DC Comic Characters   \t\tJustice League is coming out on Friday and with that, we have another movie list. Today I will be ranking the top DC comic-book characters of all-time. This list is based off of the history and impact on pop culture. I’m basing this list off because their haven’t been enough movies in the DCU to make up a top 10 list; like I did with the Marvel list I made 2 weeks ago. With that out of the way, here are the top DC characters of all-time.Honorable Mentions- Two-Face, Ra’s Al Ghul, Lois Lane, Braniac, Bane, and Green Arrow10 Commissioner Gordon- He’s not your typical hero but Commissioner James Gordon is the definition of a hero. As the commissioner of Gotham City, he and Batman help clean up the streets of crime. He’s also the father of Batgirl and is of the Dark Knight’s most important supporting characters.9 Lex Luthor- As Superman’s arch enemy, Lex Luthor is one of the most iconic villains in comic-book history. What makes Luthor so scary is that he has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Superman and he doesn’t have any powers. But it helps when you are the smartest man in the world. Sometimes, it truly is “mind over muscle”.8 Dick Grayson (Robin/Nightwing)- Along with Batman, he and Dick Grayson form one of the most famous dynamic duos in the history of pop culture. Known to many as the original Robin, Grayson has gone on an incredible journey. He’s gone from a kid full of wonder to the hardened badass hero known as Nightwing.7 Hal Jordan (Green Lantern)- He’s a galactic space cop and he’s a one of the original core members of the Justice League.  Originally a fighter pilot, Jordan was chosen by the power ring from the planet Oa to join the Green Lantern Corps. With the ring, Jordan becomes one of the most powerful characters in all of DC Comics.6 Barry Allen (The Flash)- While he’s not the original Flash (Wally West), Barry Allen is by far the most iconic. After getting hit with a bolt of lightning, Allen gains superhuman speed and even has the ability to time travel. Ezra Miller will be bringing Barry Allen to the big screen for the first time in Justice League.5 Selina Kyle (Catwoman)- Not only is Catwoman the sexiest characters in all of comics, she’s also one of the best. Selina Kyle is the definition of an anti-hero as she’s only goal in life is to get rich and look out for her own interests. She’s also had two incredible portrayals one the big screen; the first being Michelle Pfeiffer and the ladder being Anne Hathaway.4 The Joker- There are countless iconic villains in comic book history, but no one can truly compete with The Joker. I could go on for hours about what makes the Joker so scary but I get down to the nitty. First off, no one knowns who he is (not even Batman) and there’s no rhyme or reason why he does what he does. He just does horrendous things because he can. He’s a true psychopath and one of the greatest villains in the history of pop culture.3 Diana Prince (Wonder Woman)- As we move into the DC Trinity, we start with the Warrior. Wonder Woman is the princess of Themyscira and arguably the most iconic female character in all of pop culture. What makes Diana such an incredible character is her strength, both literally and figuratively. Not only does she poses God like strength and extremely skilled in sword fighting, Diana is a very forgiving and loving character. She sees the best in people and that’s what makes her great.2 Kal-El/Clark Kent (Superman)- As the 1st superhero ever created it’s safe to say a few of you have heard of Superman. Not only is he one of the most famous superheroes, he’s arguably the most powerful. I also love the duality of Superman as he comes from two different worlds and two different ideals. You have Kal-El; the all power godlike alien vs Clark Kent; the regular American kid from Kansas. Not only is he trying to be a symbol of hope for the world, but he himself is trying to find his place in it. Deep stuff.1 Bruce Wayne (Batman)- Was there really any doubt here? Not only is Batman the greatest DC character of all-time, he’s the greatest comic-book character ever created. Not only is he more feared man in the world, he’s the leader of the Justice League. Oh yea, the man doesn’t even have any powers! What I love so much about Batman is that he a normal dude who just wants to make the world a better place. Driven by the tragedy of the death of his parents, Batman will never stop and give up on Gotham City. He is vengeance, he is the night, he is the goddamn Batman.Written By: Steven Santoro (SVS_1993)I love sports and movies. Be on the lookout for articles about both.

      "screenrant.comThe 10 Best DC Comic Books Of 2021, According To Reddit2021 marked the start of DC Comics' launch of Infinite Frontier, and fans on Reddit celebrate the various great comic book series that it came with.The last year was another where the comic book industry saw a boost in mainstream commercial and critical success. 2021 was also the year that marked DC Comics' launch of their Infinite Frontier brand-wide initiative to progress beyond 2016's Rebirth era.RELATED: 10 Best Daredevil Comics For New Fans To Start WithAside from superhero icons like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman, some great creator-driven series have also earned their respective acclaim. Comic book fans on Reddit have shared their thoughts and compiled their lists on what they believe to be the publisher's best work over the last year, ranging from their mainline and alternate canon stories.While his live-action tenure on the then-DC Universe streaming platform was unfortunately cut short, comic book fans commonly regard him as one of DC's best monster characters. Redditor LordCosmagog chimes in saying \"For me, the best books of the last 12 months have been Justice League Dark & Swamp Thing,\" with the Guardian of the Green being one of JLD's prominent members historically.Ram V.'s The Swamp Thing limited series garnered consistently high praise across its 10-issue run in its introduction of the next Guardian of the Green and new compelling, emotional themes that the likes of Alan Moore revitalized the character with. The great reception of the series led DC to greenlight another six issues for another run.The recent trailer for The Batman has stirred even more fan excitement, making now a good time for fans to read Mattson Tomlin's Batman: The Imposter. Tomlin was brought on in 2019 to assist Reeves and Peter Craig in writing the movie, and the premise and quality of the series seem like a clear influence from his time on it.It's perhaps the most grounded the Dark Knight has been in comics, focusing on a gritty, street-level crime-noir story of someone impersonating Batman to ruin his young reputation. Redditor SequentialNation compiled a list including \"the various excellent creator-driven books from DC Black Label,\" with The Imposter among them. Its praise is further testament to DC Black Label publishing some of the best modern Batman comics.While still in the realm of DC Black Label, James Tynion IV's The Nice House on the Lake is an isolated horror series to change the pace. The writer came from a well-received tenure on Detective Comics and recently wrapped up his Batman run, with Tynion emphasizing that his best strengths come the bizarre and frightening.RELATED: 10 Best Comic Books Ever, According To RankerRedditor TerraObus responds to the aforementioned list saying that \"Most of my top 10 comics of the year are listed up here,\" and that \"The Nice House On The Lake is the best of the bunch.\" The series is six issues in with another half-dozen to go, and it's already enthralling readers with visually striking moments of terror and character drama.Another former Batman writer transitioned over to DC Black Label for something refreshing. Tom King's Batman may have had its ups and downs, but his subversive noir \"whodunit\"-style The Human Target has been a proven hit. Redditor boom-bam praises the series saying \"he’s playing with all the classic noir tropes but having them play out in the superhero world.\"The story prides itself on influence from the classic, pulpy detective-noir stories of the 20th century while simultaneously, as the same Redditor points out, subverting that genre's tropes \"by having it play out in these beautiful splashy neon colors and Smallwood’s kinda hopeful lovely optimistic drawings.\"Being DC Comics' best street-level superhero, Batman is a character prime for anthology-style crime-drama adventures as well as the typical long-form story arcs. The announcement of Urban Legends signaled a further emphasis on this storytelling style, bringing together various accomplished creators from the comic book industry to make their mark on the Caped Crusader's celebrated mythos.One of which includes Chip Zdarsky, the current writer of the ongoing and acclaimed Daredevil series for Marvel. Redditor FranklinRichardss agrees with DC's success saying \"I mean in a lot of genres and format. DC released awesome comics this year,\" citing Urban Legends in their list of the year's best works.DC Black Label has also introduced more Wonder Woman into the mix, giving the Princess of Themyscira more of the spotlight she deserves. This series continues the fan-favorite brand of the \"color\" series alongside the flagship Batman: Black & White.RELATED: 10 Best Teenage Superhero Characters, According To RankerThe previous Redditor gives it particular praise with the other color series saying \"I'm not even talking about color series they [have] done for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\" Like the other two members of The Trinity, Wonder Woman's Black & Gold series was well-received for gathering various creatives to celebrate the history of an iconic superhero in several anthology stories.The Infinite Frontier relaunch was also a major milestone for Superman. Superman's main comic book series has been the self-titled series and Action Comics, but this year marked a sort of relaunch for Superman with the subtitle Son of Kal-El. Fan-favorite writer Tom Taylor helmed the series as its writer, and it's been a great success so far.Redditor FranklinRichardss also highlights Son of Kal-El for being part of DC's \"multiple LGBT+ stories,\" as it revealed Jonathan Kent coming out as bisexual. Jon Kent getting a turn in the spotlight has been a long time coming since he and Damian Wayne have been favorites in the form of the Super-Sons for some time already. Taylor's series has been praised for its emotional, character-focused writing.The same Redditor also includes Nightwing in DC's corner of mainline successes over the past year, with Dick Grayson seeing a return to form in the current Tom Taylor run. Grayson will always be a widely beloved member of the Bat-family, in part for being the original second-half of the Dynamic Duo, but also being a likable, interesting, and charming character in his own right.Nightwing's current high praises largely go toward its grounded approach by making use of the \"soft-reboot\" formula that understands the fundamentals of what makes him such a lovable hero. At the same time, it's a great jumping-on point for those who are new or have been away for some time.Also in Wonder Woman's corner of the world, DC Black Label's Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons series only has had one issue published so far, yet is already turning many fans' heads. Redditor SequentialNation included the comic in their list when referring to the \"excellent creator-driven books from DC Black Label.\"RELATED: 10 DC Heroes That Are Darker Than Their VillainsThe Amazons so far is a sprawling odyssey of a story that packs a thoroughly engrossing plot, gods true to the original folklore, and visually-stunning artwork on every page thanks to writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Phil Jimenez. Issue #1 already sets a high bar, with more creatives set to lend their talents in subsequent issues.The earlier note on \"about color series they [have] done for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman\" also includes Superman: Red & Blue. Like the other color series, Red & Blue has been praised for its tasteful approach in bringing together writers and artists to pay tribute to one of DC Comics' greatest superheroes.The new comic book series makes great use of the anthology-style to tell stories highlighting the history of the character. The stories told throughout its 6-issue run are great for veteran fans looking for a celebration of Superman while also being friendly to newcomers who want to get to know the superhero icon.NEXT: 10 Best Animated Batman Movies, According To RankerGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he now resides in Houston. He is a fan of pretty much anything involving nerd culture. Video games, comics, movies, TV, anime, manga, you name it.

      "Best DC Comics Of 2018Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJune 18, 2018 by Dave 6 Comments DC Comics has maintained their status as comic book retailer and critic’s favorite son throughout 2018. Now approximately two years since the launch of DC Universe: Rebirth #1, the publisher has been hitting a *majority* of the right notes (though far from all given the damn countless number of comics credits that still bear the dark mark of Eddie Berganza). Likewise, the publisher’s major 2018 event, DC Metal, was one of the best superhero crossovers of the decade, setting the stage for a compelling Justice League lineup through the end of the year.Recent moves suggest this PR glory boat may come to a fiery end by the time 2018 turns one. DC made the strange decision to raise prices nearly linewide to $3.99, while simultaneously removing digital codes from nearly all comics (“What we lack in talent, we make up for in ineptitude.”) Likewise, both DC’s “New Age of Heroes” and “Doomsday Clock” haven’t struck much of the desired cultural chord, and the publisher has absolutely *none* of the built-in movie hype that Marvel Comics *should* in theory reap the benefits of.Still, there’s a lot to find exciting about DC’s back half, including their “Black Label” lineup that will include the likes of Frank Miller and John Romita Jr producing “Superman: Year One.” Mix in writer Tom King’s promised 100 issues on Batman, Brian Michael Bendis’ rebirth on Superman, and the promise of a Lex Luthor/Porky Pig one-shot, and it’s easy to get wildly excited.Related Reading Orders:BatmanComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Late 2017 saw the title seemingly ascending to perfection with a run of “Batman Annual #2” and the “Superfriends” double date story arc in Batman #36 to #37. 2018 has seen writer Tom King and a rotating cast of fantastic artists including Joelle Jones, Clay Mann, and Tony Daniel, come back to earth – meaning this is simply *one* of the best DC Comics of the year, not the *absolute* best.Related Reading Orders:DC MetalOn “Best Comics Ever,” Comic Book Herald’s all-new podcast, I made DC Metal my first deep dive topic, and concluded it’s the second best superhero event of the decade (just behind Marvel’s 2015 Secret Wars). Events and crossovers are *rarely* this engaging, and almost never this cohesive, yet New 52 Batman team Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo (with plenty of help from their friends) deliver a cosmic Justice League epic worthy of the “Crisis” adjacent status.Related Reading Orders:DeathstrokeQuickly escalated from “interesting” to “must-read” status in year one, and shows no signs of slowing during the collective comics Christopher Priest appreciation resurgence.Related Reading Orders:Justice LeagueThe biggest downside to Christopher Priest’s time writing Justice League is that it only lasted 10 issues before the big linewide shakeup.Related Reading Orders: SupermanThere’s been so much hype about longtime Marvel writer Brian Michael Bendis’ move to DC’s Superman, that it’s easy to overlook what has been one of DC’s best comics since Rebirth began. Helmed primarily by Peter Tomasi and Patrick Gleason (with plenty of additional creators), Superman taps into the family dynamics of Lois, Clark, and their son Jon better than just about any comic has this decade.Related Reading Orders:SupermanDamian WayneLooking back, it makes perfect sense that Tomasi and Gleason, fresh off excellent work writing Damian Wayne for the New 52’s Batman and Robin, and actively telling new stories about Superson Jon Kent, would be able to create a delightful early adolescent team-up. Much their fathers, the sons of Batman and Superman play off each other’s persona’s for a great balance.Related Reading Orders:DC RebirthThere are higher profile Bat-books, and there are Bat-books with bigger stakes, but few pack the emotional, intimate punch of James Tynion IV’s time writing Detective Comics.Related Reading Orders: BatmanDespite all the trappings of an overexplored trope trussed up with clever design (what if the Joker was, like, good?), Batman: White Knight delivers a compelling limited series.Related Reading Orders:New GodsDC Rebirth Year TwoEvery issue of Mister Miracle, a twelve issue limited series by Tom King and Mitch Gerads, is a reminder that 1) It’s the best comic book being published and 2) The New Gods are flipping exploding with boundless potential. Truly, from innovative layouts, to structural mystery, to grin-inducing family humor, Mister Miracle isn’t just the best DC Comic, it’s just the best comic.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Slatron says June 18, 2018 at 1:15 pmTBH, I can count the number of DC superhero comic arcs I’ve enjoyed on three fingers. (All Star Superman, Blackest Night, Morrison’s Animal Man). It’s just never been my thing.Mister Miracle sounds like it might become the fourth.\n",
      "Dave says June 19, 2018 at 9:34 amMister Miracle definitely falls into that category of superhero comics that transcend the genre. I do wonder how much a familiarity with the New Gods matters. It definitely adds a lot to my experience, but maybe that’s less essential than my gut tells me.\n",
      "D.M Johnston says May 7, 2020 at 2:32 amB4 I get to my comment I’d like to say thank you for this website and keep up the great work brotha. I absolutely agree with all the praise you’ve given Kings Mister Miracle series these last couple of years. Other than Darkseid I had absolutely no familiarity with any of the New Gods whatsoever until I started reading Mister Miracle. Now its one of my all time favorites and I’ve read every Fourth World comic I can find and I cant wait for the New Gods movie to come out. Its THAT good.\n",

      "Best Comics of 2022 (So Far): DC ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — On the heels of one of its strongest 12-month periods in many years, DC Comics has continued that momentum in 2022. In fact, today’s list of the Best Comics of 2022 — DC Comics has that good problem of there being too many excellent series worthy of inclusion. We, however, have done our best to break it down to eight uniformly excellent books that speak to the broader quality of the publisher’s line. You can find those selections below, and as we noted in the Best Comics of 2022 — Marvel Comics list, don’t forget to check this page every month for an updated ranking.Enjoy!1. Catwoman: Lonely CityWriter/Artist: Cliff ChiangWhy It’s Cool: There’s an irony in Catwoman: Lonely City being at the top of our Best Comics of 2022 - DC Comics list, because of this writing in late March, the series hasn’t released a new issue this year. But the next issue is coming? Catwoman: Lonely City #3 is due out April 19, and series editor Chris Conroy has said it’s the best issue yet. That’s saying a lot, a whole lot, given the Catwoman: Lonely City #1 was one of less than five single issue comics that I gave a perfect 10 score to last year. It was, without exaggeration, the best ﻿single issue experience I’ve had with a DC comic in a really long time. A singular and detailed vision from cartoonist Cliff Chiang, the book reads like a 2022 Dark Knight Returns, just focused on Catwoman. She’s older, piecing together a broken Gotham City where Batman has been dead for years. She’s mixing it up with new, diverse characters as well as aged Batman rogues who are still kicking around. And it’s all taking place in a Gotham that Chiang has said is heavily influenced by real world New York City, from its changing culture to its municipal politics. On top of all the visionary artwork and character-driven attention to detail, this series also has charm to spare. It’s a deeply heartfelt and at times funny book, one that entertains in unique and special ways on every page.Pre-Order The Hardcover: Catwoman - Lonely City HCRead The First Issue Digitally: Catwoman - Lonely City #12. The Nice House on the LakeWriter: James Tynion IVArtist: Álvaro Martínez BuenoMost Recent Trade: Nice House on the Lake, Vol. 1Why It’s Cool: The Nice House on the Lake #1 was one of the other five comics last year that I gave a perfect 10 out of 10 too. It really is a perfect debut issue, one that is imaginative, chilling, stylish, and as assured as a new comic gets. In the other six issues that have so far come out, ﻿the book has progressed and evolved, become perhaps one of the best pieces of pandemic fiction, a perfect horror/sci-fi reflection of how it feels to live through a chaotic world in relative comfort, guilty and powerless to some extent to do anything about what’s happening.The other quality that lands The Nice House on the Lake at our number two spot is the stunning artwork by Álvaro Martínez Bueno, colored to eerie perfection by Jordie Bellaire. This is a DC comic, published through the Black Label imprint, but there’s no predictable superhero visuals to this book. The work Bueno is doing here feels imaginative and wholly new, with surprises often coming after any page turn. It feels in the best way like Vertigo Comics at its height, just in terms of competency, smarts, and risk-taking. This book is another must-read.3. Action ComicsWriter: Phillip Kennedy JohnsonPrimary Artists: Daniel Sampere, Miguel Mendonca, and Riccardo FedericiMost Recent Trade: Superman - Action Comics, Vol. 1 - Warworld RisingWhy It’s Cool: I like this run so much that it inspired me to write a piece called It’s Time to Talk About Action Comics because it Whips Ass. And it absolutely does. It’s a story in which Superman gets lost in space with an updated, 2022 version of The Authority. Operating outside the nascent — and currently underpowered — United Planets’ perview, Superman has decided to take on the most-recent, very powerful Mongul and his warworld. What has ensued is a deep space gladiator epic (a bit like World War Hulk, but also not at all like World War Hulk), where Superman is working to liberate a full planet of oppressed people with his powers dampened. At the same time, members of his splintered team are working in the shadows to foment a revolution. Simply put, these are high-action, giant sci-fi concept, complex comics. They’re armed with fantastic, grandiose artists, a writer who is nailing every story beat, and a sense of momentum I haven’t felt from an individual Superman comic in many years. If you’re looking for an engaging more traditional superhero comic than the first two on this list, this is the one.Other Relevant Trades: Future State - Superman; Superman & The Authority; Superman - The One Who Fell; and Superman - Action Comics, Vol. 1 - Warworld Rising4. Human TargetWriter: Tom KingArtist: Greg SmallwoodMost Recent Trade: Human Target, Vol. 1Why It’s Cool: I am a sucker for any comic that takes tropes from other genres and affixes them to superhero characters. DC Comics has done this really well in recent years, with stories like DCeased, which is what if zombie apocalypse but with DC characters, as well as with Dark Knights of Steel, which is what if twisty political fantasy epic but with DC characters. Human Target, however, is my favorite of them all, and it’s what if old Hollywood noir but with DC characters, specifically the characters from the classic run of Justice League International. What makes this comic truly special is the pop-art sequential storytelling being done by Greg Smallwood, which has just been stunning. Combine that with Tom King’s clear common of punchy, old-time dialogue complete with over-the-top exaggerated hard-boiled characterization, and you get an excellent comic that reads unlike any other book from DC. There’s some grumbling out there about the relationship this comic has to the source material, but this is essentially an Elseworld story, where taking liberties with the characters is part of the point.5. One Star SquadronWriter: Mark RussellArtist: Steve LieberWhy It’s Cool: This is another book that sort of fits into what I was writing about above, the type of out-of-continuity superhero comics that use these well-known characters in the service of exploring other types of story. In this case, it’s superheroes meets Glengarry Glen Ross, and, if I’m being honest, the superheroes aren’t all that well-known. No, this is a book about the deepest of deep DC Universe bench characters, who are now working for a new app-based company where users can pay to rent hero’s time, doing so for everything from temporary security gigs to making appearances at children’s birthday parties.The real villain of this story is, of course, corporate greed, which turns even people who use extraordinary powers to combat evil into faceless pieces of a machine, susceptible at any time to the machinations of a few suited folks in a boardroom. Armed with writer Mark Russell’s signature satiric wit and the clever-but-heartfelt cartooning of Steve Lieber, One-Star Squadron rounds out the top five of our best comics of 2022 — DC Comics list.Read The First Issue: One-Star Squadron #1 Digital 6. Arkham City: The Order of the WorldWriter: Dan WattersArtist: DaniWhy It’s Cool: Like the majority of the in-continuity Batman comics right now, Arkham City - The Order of the World depicts an interesting corner of Gotham City that we don’t get to often see in the main title. It’s a story that features Azrael, some familiar old villains, and one absolutely chilling new villain that I hope we get to see again, sooner rather than later. This is perhaps the Batman comic right now that has the most experimental concepts, armed as it is as well with a chic almost-abstract indie comics aesthetic. Writer Dan Watters and artist Dani are a hell of a team — as see in the hit indie comic series, Coffin Bound — and it’s been a real treat to see them taking their talents to Gotham. This is a six-issue miniseries that recently concluded, with a trade collection presumably on the way at some point later this year.Read The First Issue: Arkham City - The Order of the World #1 Digital7. The Swamp ThingWriter: Ram V.Primary Artist: Mike PerkinsMost Recent Trade: The Swamp Thing, Vol. 1 — BecomingWhy It’s Cool: Excuse this absolutely awful bit of punning, but this new run of The Swamp Thing has made for fertile ground for some of the best superhero comics at DC. Very sorry about that, but it’s true. This is an updated take on the character, one that uses Mike Perkins gritty cartooning and Ram V’s knack for poetic scripting to give this series a poignant sensibility that feels apart from anything else coming from DC Comics. In that way, it’s a book I’d recommend to readers who are new to the character but have enjoyed Ram V’s work around mythology and colonialism in his indie breakout titles — These Savage Shores and The Many Deaths of Laila Star, chief among them — as well as to readers who enjoy a good story about Swamp Thing.Read The First Issue: The Swamp Thing #1 DigitalRead our full review of the first trade!8. Batman/Superman — World’s FinestWriter: Mark WaidArtist: Dan MoraWhy It’s Cool: The art on this book is absolutely beautiful, looking as bright and iconic as these characters can. Dan Mora, with colors by Tamra Bonvillain, is just doing absolutely stunning work. Making things even better, is that Mark Waid (Kingdom Come) is back at DC Comics, doing his first proper run on a title in I don’t know how long, and it feels like he’s been saving this story for years. It’s fast and clever and it seems determined to span some of the most fun corners of the DC Universe, from obscure Superman villians to steady cameo appearances by the Doom Patrol. This is perhaps the best book right now for fans of traditional DC superhero comics, and it’s just getting started.Read The First Issue: Batman/Superman — World’s Finest #1 DigitalRead our review of the first issue!9. Monkey PrinceWriter: Gene Luen Yang 楊謹倫Artist: Bernard Chang 張伯納Why It’s Cool: Writer Gene Luen Yang, teamed here with artist Bernard Chang, is doing perhaps his most personal work yet for DC Comics, having created a new superhero for the publisher that springs from the same mythology that informed/appeared in Yang’s breakout graphic novel, American Born Chinese, one of the true must-read comics of the past 20 years. This series is about a teen superhero coming to terms with a power set and a power source unlike anything we’ve really seen in Big 2 superhero comics. On top of that, Yang and Chang also infuse the entire story with a sense of fun and a hilarious, attitude-heavy sense of humor. There’s so much that makes this a fun, colorful read, a different kind of superhero comic that’s perfect for readers of all ages. Read The First Issue: Monkey Prince #1 DigitalRead our review of the first issue!10. The JokerWriter: James Tynion IVPrimary Artist: Guillem MarchMost Recent Trade: The Joker, Vol. 1 HardcoverWhy It’s Cool: A series about The Joker is not necessarily something I’d be into, and yet this still one of my favorite Batman-adjacent comics, landing it a spot on my Best Comics of 2022 DC Comics list. While The Joker obviously takes the title and the focus of the book’s marketing, this series is really about Commissioner Jim Gordon, who has quite a bit of history with the titular villain. This series grew directly from the biggest event to happen in the Batman comics in some time, wherein someone gassed the villains at Arkham Asylum, and the crime was blamed on The Joker. This book sees Jim Gordon on a globetrotting hunt for The Joker, financed by a shady group of wealthy Gothamies who are fed up with The Joker’s chaos and murder. The result is a complex and interesting character-driven series that makes the most of Batman continuity, past and present.Read The First Issue: The Joker #1 DigitalHonorable Mentions: Batman Killing Time, Batman — The Knight, Dark Knights of Steel, DC Vs. Vampires, Detective Comics, Nightwing, Robin, Task Force Z, and Wonder Woman.This section is dedicated to recent DC Comics trade collections and graphic novels newly available in 2022. I highly recommend this entire list, almost all of which can be picked up by new or lapsed readers and enjoyed on its own merits. Each entry below goes back to the start of its given run, although some are ongoing and many are self-contained and a few others are forthcoming.

      "The Super Hero Addicts Rehab Center2019 is coming to a close and this is our list for the best Marvel Comics of 2019. Marvel had an amazing year. Lots of great stories came in 2019. From cosmic battles to amazing character deconstruction, from heartfelt comedy to serious issues, Marvel splendidly showcased some of the most amazing stories of the year.So before diving right into the list.Note:Fantastic Four: Dan Slott(W),\n",

      "Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man: Tom Taylor(W)\n",
      "Killmonger: Bryan Hill(W)Without further ado:Writer(s): Donny CatesArtist(s): Tradd MooreLast Issue: #5What’s not to love about this book. Trad Moores’s artwork is criticized for this book, but for me Moore’s art was fresh. It wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea.  The story was brilliant as well. Silver Surfer is sucked into a black hole where he finds a nemesis older than time itself.Writer(s): Ed BrissonArtist(s): Mike HendersonLast Issue: #12This is the Death of Wolverine done right. Old Man Logan is dying and he got one last task to do. Kill Mysterio. He wants to prevent what happened on his Earth. Brisson really knows this character. Mysterio’s and Hawkeye’s characterization are well done. With rough and tuff art by Henderson, what more can you want.Writer(s): Gerry Duggan/ Jim Zub/ Roy ThomasArtist(s): Ron Garney/ Patch Zircher/ Alan DavisCurrent Issue: #112019 was a huge year for Conan. From his introduction into the Marvel Universe to fighting alongside Marvel heroes. This book represents all the Conan comics of 2019. We choose this book for the list because for us this is the best Conan comic right now. The first five issues by Duggan was just grand. This book saw lots of shifts from writers but even that can’t detract from this amazing story. Currently in the hands of the amazing Roy ThomasWriter(s): Chip ZdarskyArtist(s): Carlos Magno &Butch GuiceCurrent Issue: #11Anyone who is a fan of Marvel comics knows too well that Donny Cates and Chip Zdarsky are THE best writers Marvel has to offer in 2019. This book is about Marvel’s very first team. Captain America, Namor, Human Torch and Winter Soldier. But now Namor declared war against the surface world. Every issue is a breathtaking ride and rightfully deserves a spot on any top 10 list.Writer(s): Mark WaidArtist(s): Jesus Saiz/ Javier PinaLast Issue: #20Clearly one of the underrated Marvel comics in 2019. Started with Steven Strange finding the cure of magic in space adventure then squaring off with Dormammu with newfound allies. This series is just pure fun to read. Then Waid is joined by Barry Kitson(W) and Scott Koblish(A) to tell the story of Herald Supreme. The story at times feels a little too rushed but it’s still definitely worth the read.Writer(s): El EwingArtist(s): Joe BennettCurrent Issue: #27This book was our #1 pick for Best Marvel Comic of 2018. The only reason it is not our #1 this year because 1-4 are just too good. It started as a horror book, then Hulk was in hell, fought Shadowbase and now cosmic. This book is just perfect. The art of Joe Bennett is justly fitting for this book.Writer(s): Christos GageArtist(s): Mike HawthroneLast Issue: #12When this book started I wasn’t sure where it was going or if it was even necessary. Back in 2012, Slott had already told a perfect ending, but as the story untold, man was I wrong. This book deals with Otto being a hero and a second chance at life. The whole characterization and deconstruction of a character and the relation with a new side of the character is pure joy.Writer(s): Jonathan HickmanArtist(s): Pepe Larraz(HoX)/ R B Silva(PoX)Current/Last Issue: #6 issue eachThese 2 comics right here literally revolutionized the X-Men. Charles Xavier is done with his dream of mutant equality. He is shown why he will always fail. Now its time to take action into his own hands. We can’t emphasize how amazing these books are. Every issue is unpredictable. Readers will never know what’s going to hit them in the next issue. The spin off of these books is Dawn of X which is equally amazing. A little slow but still worth reading.Writer(s): Donny CatesArtist(s): Ryan StegmanCurrent/Last Issue: #20(Venom) / #5(Absolute Carnage)I personally am not a Venom fan. But what Donny Cates did with Venom is spectacular. He created a whole mythos around the symbiote species. This comic is a well-crafted tale of both symbiote and Eddie Brock. While talking about Absolute Carnage, this event is undoubtedly the BEST Marvel event of 2019.Writer(s): Chip ZdarskyArtist(s): Marco Checchetto/ Lalit Kumar SharmaCurrent Issue: #14We have Hulk going cosmic, Venom got a Symbiote God and X-Men have been revolutionized while Daredevil is suffering from mental issues. This is the deconstruction of the character done perfectly. Art varies from issue to issue but it least affects the story which is inexpressibly beautiful. So if you want to read only one comic this year, then this is the comic.If your favorite comics of 2019 aren’t on the list then comment it down below and tell us why you loved it!!Great list Vince, Marvel really had some great books this year. I personally feel that they beat DC this year. YOTV really hasn’t done much in my opinion.Thanks, Nick. Loved that you enjoyed the list!!Great list with some truly accurate reviews- daredevil is by far the best, nothing I ever like ever finished top so thanks for that 😊 look forward to 2020!\n",

      "www.cbr.com10 Best DC Comics Of 2020Despite what anyone says about DC's movies or TV shows in 2020, they hit some major home runs with their actual comic books last year.For fans of DC Comics, 2020 was an excellent year for storytelling, even if there were a few bumps in the road. Along with the regular series starring well-known properties, DC put out some fun and exciting events and self-contained stories in their comics. While some titles were canceled for various reasons or cut short of their intended length, most, if not all, were high-quality products, both in writing and artwork.RELATED:  DC: 10 Characters That Made Their Comic Debut in 2020DC Comics put forth a diverse line of books for readers of all ages, different genres, along with options for new and established readers. As is always the case with such a wide range of comics, there were some that stood out from the others for many different reasons.Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner return to the antihero character of Harley Quinn, the character that they made their mark on and made popular with their five-year run. Released in conjunction with the motion picture of the same name, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey miniseries finds Harley making her return to Gotham after her break-up with long time beau, The Joker, who is not taking her decision to end the relationship lightly.RELATED: 10 Things The Harley Quinn Animated Series Does Better Than Birds of PreyPublished under the Black Label imprint, this miniseries is a mature romp through Gotham as the Birds of Prey must protect Harley from the mass of bad guys out to collect her for The Joker. The series is a perfect bookend to Conner and Palmiotti's run on the character and a fun read with all the humor one would expect, making it the best book featuring Harley in 2020.The addition of the Hill House Comics imprint curated by Joe Hill, best known for previous works such as Locke and Key, brought the horror genre to the DC Comics. The first wave of miniseries' included titles such as Basket Full Of Heads, The Dollhouse Family, Daphne Byrne, and Plunge by some of the biggest names in horror.The title that stood out as one of the best was The Low, Low Woods, written by Carmen Maria Machado with art by Dani, following two teenagers who find themselves on a surreal and terrifying journey as they search for the truth about their strange hometown.Far Sector, the Young Animal imprint starring the Green Lantern Sojourner Mulleinv, and by Hugo Award-winning writer N.K. Jemisin with art by Jameson Jamal Campbell is a breath of fresh air and an exciting take on the Green Lantern concept. The maxiseries, set to wrap up at the beginning of 2021, takes the opposite approach of Grant Morrison's equally great The Green Lantern, setting itself apart by ignoring the usual superhero conventions associated with the character.RELATED: Green Lantern: 10 Stories To Re-Read Before The 80th Anniversary SpecialInstead, Far Sector focuses on the science fiction aspects and exploration of societal values one would expect if such things took place in the real world. One thing to note about this series that might be deemed as a negative is that it has a release schedule of every other month.This post-modern work covering his life from 1975 through 1995, beginning with his move to Suicide Slum to become a teacher and his vigilante life, retells classic moments from DCU history from the Black Lightning's perspective. If this first issue is what can be expected of the rest of the miniseries, readers are in for a new and fresh look at the DCU, guaranteed to become a classic \"must-read.\"In 2020, The Rebirth Era of the DCU wrapped up with one of the most anticipated series, Batman: Three Jokers, a thread that went back to the end of the New 52. Geoff Johns/Jason Fabok's ambitious story, though met with mixed reviews, still was a great read, providing readers closure while creating future avenues for the dynamic between Batman and The Joker to be exploredRELATED: Batman: 5 Questions Three Jokers Answered (& 5 It Left Hanging)Released at the same time as The Joker War event over in the main Bat-Family titles, Three Jokers is the perfect companion piece as it deals with the psychological impact the Joker has had, while Joker War takes a comprehensive perspective on the Joker's madness. In short, Three Jokers is a satisfying squeal to other classic Joker stories like The Killing Joke.Since starting the young reader graphic novels in 2019, the DC Ink line of offerings grew by leaps and bounds in 2020 without sacrificing quality for quantity. These graphic novels feature a stellar roster of bestselling writers and artists, offer self-contained stories featuring the company's iconic heroes, suited for audiences young and old.In 2020 the two books that stood out among the rest were Wonder Woman: Warbringer and You Brought Me the Ocean by Alex Sanchez and Julie Maroh starring Jackson Hyde. These graphic novels are great ways to introduce comics to young readers and focus on characters like Aqualad, who don't receive much page space in the regular DCU.A worldwide pandemic could stop Tom Taylor from continuing to bring out dead in three installments his DCeased story to life in 2020. The Hope At Worlds End chapter found the heroes in Metropolis dealing with the aftermath of the destruction during the original series, centering around Jimmy Olsen and how the heroes dealt with the onslaught of the Anti-Living.RELATED: DC: 5 Reasons DCeased Is The Best Zombie Apocalypse Arc (& 5 Why It's Dead Planet)Unkillables shifted the spotlight on to villains and anti-heroes such as Jason Todd and Deathstroke and explored how the villains faired after the heroes left Earth. The latest installment, Dead Earth, finds the new Trinity of Damian Wayne, Jon Kent, and Cassie Sandsmark, the Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman of Earth 2 traveling back to a dead planet after receiving a strange SOS beacon from Earth. Readers can only hope that there is more in store for this series.The Justice League Dark has been exploring and defending the DCU from magical threats in one form or another since its incarnation at the beginning of The New52. The latest team, led by Wonder Woman and a team comprised of team regulars Detective Chimp, Swamp Thing, and Zatanna, along with newcomers Dr. Fate and Man-Bat, and faced threats from the Dark Multiverse and beyond.This series, especially since Ram V took over as writing duties, has been once of the hidden gems of the DCU and hopefully will be a part of the new Infinite Frontier era.If one event that defined the DC Universe in 2020, it would be Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo's conclusion to their Dark Nights Saga in the pages of Dark Nights: Death Metal. Along with the main story told in a seven-issue limited series, there were plenty of one-shots that explored the many corners of the Metalverse, brought to life by the Dark Multiverse Batman Who Laughs.RELATED: Dark Nights: 10 Unanswered Questions From The Death Metal FinaleThis epic series not only introduced a ton of interesting characters but also set the stage for the next incarnation of the DC Universe, from the Future State event to the Infinite Frontier set to debut in March. The Dark Nights: Metal saga has been a fun, long strange trip, and it is sad to see it come to an end.Superman Smashes the Klan by Chinese-American writer Gene Luen Yang and artist Gurihiru is by far the best book that DC published in 2020. The three-issue limited series' main plot loosely adapts the 1946 story arc \"Clan of the Fiery Cross\" from The Adventures of Superman radio show. The story, set in 1946, follows the Lees, a Chinese-American family, who move from Chinatown to the suburbs of Metropolis following World War II and the subtle and overt racism they settle into the community.When the family is targeted and harassed by the Klan, Superman steps in but, in the process of helping, is forced to confront his self-doubt and self-identity as he is also an outsider. The backmatter, in which personal experience with racism as he grew up, enhances the comic and brings a much needed real-world aspect to things.NEXT: DC Comics: 10 Defining Events In 2020Chad is a lifelong comic book reader and collector who has many issues, most of which are bagged, boarded and stashed in a storage unit.

      "5 Best DC Comic Storylines of All TimeIn the words of Batman, a beloved character within the DC Universe, you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the superhero comic fanatic… that’s the correct phrasing, right? Graphic novel enthusiasts have flocked to comic book stores since DC Comics Inc.’s revelatory creation in 1934. The fanbase has grown so strong that longtime fans are growing their collection of DC comic books and DC subscription box collectibles. They’re in pursuit of fastidious character plots, heroic leaders, chilling supervillains, and of course, justice. But which DC comic storylines have stood the test of time?  The fictional DC Universe has brought us the likes of Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, more contemporary imaginings of the salacious Suicide Squad, and the tenacious Teen Titans. But no matter who sits at the zenith of your most beloved plot, there’s no doubt DC Comics has brought fans some of the most electrifying storylines of steadfast champions, unswerving guardians, and resilient defenders.Join us as we explore the best DC comic storylines, including:Debuted in 1986, “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns” entrenches its readers in Batman’s decisive final scene. The four-issue comic book miniseries, which was written and illustrated by Frank Miller, commences with a now aged and reclusive Bruce Wayne. In this series, Batman has retired. It’s been ten years since the death of his second Robin, Jason Todd, who died at the hands of Gotham’s most notorious villain, The Joker. In a decision that confronts both his identity and call of duty, Batman is abruptly called back to the crime that still plagues Gotham City when a violent gang by the name “The Mutants” appears in the alley where Batman’s parents were murdered.After acquiring a new Robin—a girl by the name of Carrie Kelley—Batman moves into the future while continually confronting the past in the form of prior foes like Harvey Dent, The Joker, and even Superman. The miniseries is one of both internal reclamation and person redemption. Not only does Frank Miller explore the evolution of Batman, but of storytelling itself, interweaving the past and future into an action-packed storyline that has inspired readers for decades, creating a legacy with impact. The twelve-issue superhero comic series, written by Mark Wald and illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu and Gerry Alanguilan, is regarded as one of the best DC storylines for its modernized retelling of the caped crusader’s thrilling origin story. Initially created with the intention of introducing a non-canon saga, the storytelling was soon adopted as canon, replacing John Byrne’s “The Man of Steel.” Superman comics depicted the home planet of Clark Kent as a cold and heartless society. This series of Superman comics begins as the infant, Kal-El (Superman), is loaded into a pod and shot into space moments before the destruction of the planet Krypton. A loaded time-lapse then transports the reader to present-day West Africa, where we become witness to the violent conflict between two warring clans—of which Clark Kent, a burgeoning reporter, is covering. Kent quickly adopts the role of protector, shielding a human rights activist from an assassination attempt while still maintaining some secrecy and keeping his superpowers unnoticed. Inevitably, the superhero is met by a disconcerting medley of death and betrayal, and he eventually heads home to Smallville, where he’s determined to learn more about his alien heritage. This sequence catapults the superhero into a world of framed disguises, criminal enterprises, and the lovely Lois Lane.It’s then that readers are introduced to Kent’s arrogant arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, the head of LexCorp. LexCorp serves as a front for Luthor’s lawless affairs. Among Luthor’s musings is Superman, who he’s convinced is not of earthly origin. With his reputation at stake, Superman attempts to uncover the past, only to be thrown into a vicious battle of alien invasions. When Luthor discovers Superman’s vulnerability, Kryptonite, the question becomes: Who will prevail?The Birthright rendition is acclaimed for its bold reimagining of one of the world’s most popular superheroes. The society of Krypton was remodeled to value the principles of hope and peace, represented by the letter “S,” which Superman later adopts as his emblem and personal motivator. Often compared to Namor, when it comes to Marvel vs. DC Comics, is Aquaman. Deemed one of the best Aquaman depictions of modern times, “Aquaman: The Trench” is the first story arc of Aquaman’s New 52 relaunch. New 52 is where DC Comics introduced the publication of 52 new series in 2011, each with revamped first issues. The story itself, which was written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Ivan Reis, offers a chilling aquatic tale that may earn its own place in the DC Comics cinematic universe.Now battling a carnivorous race known as the Trench within the watery underworld, Aquaman fights to save Boston’s civilian population—the very faction that ridiculed his powers at the onset of the novel. Following a hunch that the aquatic race dragged civilian captives to their underwater lair, Aquaman enlists the help of Stephen Shin, the marine biologist who previously taught and betrayed the Protector of the Deep. When Aquaman finally descends into the watery depths of the Marianas Trench, he discovers the Trench’s elusive underground civilization, only to be confronted by an unlikely circumstance and an urgent moral imperative. The first installment of the New 52 dives deep into the identity of the New 52 Aquaman, solidifying his role as a protector—an identity that percolates through the storylines to come. Furthermore, the illustrations are especially vivid—conjuring up strange and usual images of sharp-toothed leviathans—and combined with unsettling storytelling components that leave the comic’s readers swimming in a watery nightmare.The graphic novel, written by Greg Rucka and illustrated by J.G. Jones, is a Greek tragedy.  After participating in an ancient ritual called The Hiketeia, Wonder Woman becomes eternally honor-bound to protect and care for a woman by the name of Danielle Wellys. When Wonder Woman discovers Danielle has killed the villains who murdered her sister, however, she finds herself entangled in a battle against Batman, who is looking for the young woman.Weary of her ability to break the oath without instigating the rage of the ritual’s vengeful keepers, the Erinyes, Wonder Woman is left to deliberate between breaking the sacred agreement or betraying justice. The story, which was released in 2002, was well-received by longstanding comic fans and critics alike and is often referred to as “the best Wonder Woman story” in all of DC Comics history.In this novel, Rucka himself chooses to explore how the Lady of Justice is perceived rather than delve into her mental psyche—a task he deemed “murderous.” This method pervaded into future installments, in which Wonder Woman’s reputation is continually examined and evolving. Specifically, Rucka is primarily praised for his sharp characterization of Wonder Woman as an actual person in place of an idealized caricature of womanhood, in which he portrays the superhero as a sincere, thoughtful, and even humorous sovereign.Greatly praised amongst the comic book community, Green Lantern’s installment of the Sinestro Corps War is a comic book crossover written by Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons. Its titian aesthetic is the work of illustrators Ivan Reis, Patrick Gleason, and Ethan Van Sciver.As the second part of a trilogy, the eleven-part Sinestro Corps saga begins at the threshold of an interstellar war fought between the Green Lanterns of Earth and the Sinestro Corps, an army led by Sinestro—a former Green Lantern who seeks to entrench the universe in fear. Armed with yellow power rings, the villains of the interstellar army initiate a full assault against the Green Lanterns, freeing both Superman-Prime and Cyborg Superman from imprisonment for their own biddings.When fellow Green Lantern Kyle Rayner is taken captive, his comrades attempt to free him from Sinestro clutches only to become entrapped themselves. In a thrilling, fast-paced narrative, the forces of good and evil oscillate between triumph and defeat until the interstellar battleground transitions to Earth’s terrestrial soil.When the team of Green Lanterns learns of an ancient prophecy, they are confronted by the reality of “The Blackest Night” and the birth of five more universal corps.After its introduction, the saga was commended widely for both its storyline and illustrations, achieving a nomination for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Penciler/Inker Team. The storyline itself provoked multiple reprintings, as well. Culturally, the storyline made waves, establishing its spot as a model for crossovers for stories to come. No matter who soars highest in your arsenal of heroes, CultureFly offers the world’s finest subscription boxes, collectibles, and attire for every type of DC fan.Like the heroes before you, you must traverse into the unknown.

His progress in 2020-21 hasn't been as great, but he is also recovering from COVID-19. Few players possess Tatum's three-level scoring ability, and he has improved as a playmaker and a defender. The list of players you'd take before Tatum when starting a franchise is short.Team: LA ClippersPosition: ForwardAge: 30Previous ranking: n/a2020-21 stats: 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 49.9% FG, 45% 3FGWhere he stands right now: George had a rough showing in the NBA's bubble, but has come out with a vengeance this season. He is having his most efficient scoring season of his career while averaging a career-high in assists per game and playing his usual solid defense. The Clippers have destroyed opponents with George on the floor, outscoring them by 12 points per 100 possessions.Team: Miami HeatPosition: Guard/ForwardAge: 31Previous ranking: 112020-21 stats: 20.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 1.9 steals, 45.4% FG, 23.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Butler doesn't always fit the profile of an elite player because of his lack of shooting and occasional hesitancy to score. But just five other players this season are averaging 20-7-7 per game. Butler is averaging career-highs in rebounds and assists all while playing his usual stout defense, and the Heat are 14-8 with him in the lineup. Let's not forget that he's just a few months removed from a dominant postseason run where he went toe-to-toe with LeBron James in the Finals.\n",

Some consider him an MVP candidate. So why did his ranking fall? Doncic started the season slow, coming into training camp out of shape and struggling with efficiency. In the meantime, his Mavericks struggled out of the gate while Doncic faced critiques about complaining to refs and poor attitude. His play has ticked up lately, and his team has followed suit. Don't worry, Mavs fans: it feels like a matter of time until Doncic is a consensus top-three player.Team: Portland Trail BlazersPosition: GuardAge: 30Previous ranking: 102020-21 stats: 29.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 8.0 assists, 44.5% FG, 38.4% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Lillard is showing his value this year, carrying a battered Blazers squad missing three projected starters. Lillard rises to the occasion like no one else in the NBA: he is second in points scored in the \"clutch\" — defined as the last five minutes of a game with the score within five points — with a ridiculous 63-58-100 shooting line.

He's carrying a so-so Warriors roster to playoff contention all while scoring at near career-best levels. No player carries more gravity when he steps on the court, and Curry's unique ability to play off the ball supports the players around him.Team: Brooklyn NetsPosition: GuardAge: 312020-21 stats: 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 11.1 assists, 48.4% FG, 40% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Rejuvenated in Brooklyn, Harden has tweaked his game from all-encompassing offensive engine to, well, just playing point guard. The step-back threes and line-drives to the rim are still there, but Harden has also willingly dished the ball to teammates and selflessly advanced the ball on fastbreaks to drive the Nets offense. The Nets' plethora of offensive weapons makes it a bit harder to separate Harden's brilliance from circumstance, but he's nonetheless thriving with a change of scenery.Team: Los Angeles LakersPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 27Previous ranking: 42020-21 stats: 22.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.9 blocks, 53.3% FG, 29.3% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Davis got off to a puzzling slow start to the season and has only played in two games since early February because of an Achilles issue. We're betting the slow start is an aberration and Davis will return to the floor ready to carry the Lakers in stretch run. Perhaps the best two-way player in the NBA, Davis combines elite rim protection with a varied offensive game that extends comfortably to the three-point line. At his best, he is a problem opponents can't solve.Team: Denver NuggetsPosition: CenterAge: 26Previous ranking: 72020-21 stats: 27.1 points, 11 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 56.7% FG, 41.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Jokic is on the periphery of two incredible statistical groups, and he's doing it at the same time: averaging a triple-double with a 50-40-90 shooting line. No one has ever done both. The stats are just a glimpse at one of the league's most dominant offensive players. Jokic is more aggressive than ever, willingly shooting threes, bullying opponents in the post, and even dunking. When he's not looking for his shot, he's whipping one-handed assists around the court and serving as the fulcrum of the Nuggets offense. Denver has under-performed this season, but not because of Jokic.\n",

The frontrunner for the MVP is in the best shape of his life, scoring more efficiently than ever, all while holding down the middle for the best team in the East. The question is if Embiid can carry it over a full season and into the playoffs, but he is currently prime Shaq with a more diverse offensive game.Team: Milwaukee BucksPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 26Previous ranking: 52020-21 stats: 29 points, 11.7 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 55.7% FG, 28.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Antetokounmpo and the Bucks haven't consistently found their groove this season. It says a lot that the two-time, reigning MVP's slow start has him putting up almost identical numbers to his last two seasons. Antetokounmpo's outside shot still evades him, but his defense hasn't taken a break and he has improved as a playmaker. Players like Embiid and Jokic are threatening to pass him,  but let's give it a full season before dropping Antetokounmpo.\n",

Last year's Clippers team fell well short of their goals, but they are once again dominant with Leonard on the floor this season. After a blazing-hot start to the season, Leonard's shooting has cooled off slightly.

The smooth jumper, quick first step, and ability to read the floor and turn it up on defense when needed are all still there. Durant had likely become the best overall player in the NBA from 2017-2019 before suffering his injury in the 2019 Finals. Health is still a big question, as he's played just 19 games this season, but when he's been on the floor, he's been as dominant as ever\n",

James is past the point at which he should still be an All-Star-caliber player, let alone an MVP-caliber player. He's lost a step physically, but is still a masterful chess player, arranging the court to his will to pick apart defenses. He led the league in assists last year for the first time in his career, at age 35.

Like in years past, voters were given a simple/painful task: Rank the best 25 players in the NBA today. Only this year, we limited the panel to our pool of regular analysts: Dan Devine, J. Kyle Mann, Rob Mahoney, and Kevin O’Connor. Resident stats wizard Zach Kram also chipped in “By the numbers” analysis for each player of the list, and a video debating the top spot will drop in the coming weeks. Without further ado, the results, based on average ranking, are as follows. (All stats through Sunday; all records through Monday.)Team: Timberwolves (20-45) | Position: Big 24.8 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.3 blocks, 55.7 eFG%, -2.8 net rating, 43 GPJ. Kyle Mann: If we were simply asking “Who’s the best player on the planet?” I think KAT is low. He might be the best volume shooting center in the history of basketball, and although he’s diverged from the track that we expected for him initially, we shouldn’t let that distract us from the significance of that accolade. We’ve had 59 instances of a center posting a season with at least 200 3-point attempts, and Karl owns five of the top seven most efficient seasons, 2020-21 being one of them. Overall—nah, this isn’t exactly the mind-boggling prime output season that we might want from one of our foremost offensive frontcourt talents, but he’s still critical to Minnesota’s ... is “success” the word? We’ll call it “relative stability.” The Wolves are plus-9.9 points per 100 possessions with Towns on the court. This roster would be lost in the timber without him. We often think of Towns as a stiff-hipped pull-up shooter or a back-you-down-and-baby-hook-you post scorer (a.k.a. “The Kenny Payne Special”), but I don’t think KAT gets enough credit for the things he does in the spaces between, specifically his footwork when navigating traffic and getting to the rim. New coach Chris Finch has Towns operating away from the basket, which allows KAT to attack the basket and create more than ever, and is it possible that we’ve also underrated his creativity as a passer?Towns has been a productive kite in a hurricane for the past few seasons, but with the growth of Anthony Edwards, the thrilling surprise of Jaden McDaniels, and D’Angelo Russell’s early success playing next to KAT, the Wolves quietly seem like they’re a piece away from at least being interesting. By the numbers: There are just five seasons in NBA history in which a player averaged double-digit rebounds and at least 2.5 3-pointers per game. Two of them belong to Towns: last season and this season.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Guard17.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.7 steals, 56.9 eFG%, 9.2 net rating, 52 GPDan Devine: The price Milwaukee paid for Holiday—in terms of both the players and draft picks they sent to New Orleans during the offseason, and the nine-figure extension they gave him last month—was mighty steep. But it’s hard to argue that he hasn’t been worth the money thus far, given both how beautifully he’s fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton … and how brilliantly he performed without Giannis when the two-time MVP was out nursing a knee injury.With Giannis in and out of the lineup for a 13-game stretch starting on March 22, Holiday averaged 25.7 points, 8.2 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per 36 minutes of non-Giannis floor time. His usage spiked in those non-Giannis minutes, and his shooting exploded from “most efficient of his career” to “absolutely scorching.” It was a small sample born out of necessity, but when needed, he produced—a 27 percent usage rate, 34 percent assist rate, 65.4 true shooting—like one of the most devastating offensive forces in the league.We tend to think of Jrue as an all-world defender and complementary playmaker; we don’t think of him like that. Seeing it in action, though, made me appreciate why so many people have for so long described Holiday as the most underrated player in the league—and helped make it crystal clear why the Bucks both forked over a king’s ransom to get him and backed up the Brink’s truck to keep him.By the numbers: When Holiday was injured midseason, the Bucks lost five games in a row. With Holiday on the court, the Bucks haven’t lost more than two in a row all season.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Big19.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.1 blocks, 57.0 eFG%, 1.1 net rating, 58 GPDevine: Time and again, guards work switches against Miami’s defense, drawing Adebayo out into deep water in isolation, thinking they’re going to torch him like they do to the plodding bigs plugging the middle elsewhere in the NBA. And time and again, they learn what Couper Moorhead of Heat.com calls “the Lesson”—that Bam ain’t those other plodding bigs, and that trying to attack him one-on-one isn’t a mismatch ... at least, not in the way that they thought.This is a very loud way for Devin Booker to learn #TheLesson. pic.twitter.com/pzdyWlM8IgAdebayo switches on screens more often than any other player in the league, and more than holds his own, even against the league’s best guards. Even while shouldering a larger-than-ever share of the offensive burden in Miami this season, Bam hasn’t lost the defensive tenacity and malleability that made the Heat fall in love with him coming out of Kentucky. If anything, he’s gotten even better on that end, cementing his reputation as one of the game’s most complete stoppers with every new lesson he teaches.By the numbers: After splitting time between power forward and center in the 2019-20 regular season, Adebayo moved fully to center for the Heat’s playoff run. He’s stayed there in 2020-21, spending 99 percent of his minutes at the 5, per Cleaning the Glass.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Guard26.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.0 steals, 52.0 eFG%, 7.9 net rating, 53 GPRob Mahoney: There’s something a bit tragic about the defender who feels he’s done enough—after watching film, digesting the scouting report, and zeroing in with complete focus—only to find himself deep in a stance on the perimeter, waiting for Mitchell to make the first move. So much of what Mitchell creates begins this way, with the Jazz guard theoretically well covered by what are often bigger, longer defenders. Then the theory breaks. Mitchell stutter steps by or slams his defender into a screen. Maybe he just dribbles right past by attacking a half-beat earlier than expected. Where he distinguishes himself is through literal separation; high-level playoff defenses might challenge Mitchell to make split-second reads against layers of evolving coverage, but even those schemes operate under the assumption that the first layer is pretty much toast.Only four players in the league this season have scored more unassisted points than Mitchell, according to data from PBP Stats—notable not only for its sheer volume, but the contrast between that sort of iso scoring and the way Utah runs its offense more broadly. The Jazz sustain themselves through the patience of their ball movement, but in moments of desperation, they simplify their attack to beat the clock or minimize risk. It’s Mitchell who allows them to change gears as needed, merging the ideals of Utah’s system with the practicalities of an NBA game through the pressure he applies with a live dribble.By the numbers: Mitchell is the fourth Jazz player to reach 25 points per game in a season. The other three—Karl Malone, Adrian Dantley, and Pete Maravich—are all in the Hall of Fame.Team: Knicks (37-28) | Position: Big24.2 points, 10.3 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 0.3 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 3.7 net rating, 63 GPKevin O’Connor: An open mind has changed Randle’s career. After six seasons of mixed returns, Randle altered his tendencies in a way that has dramatically improved his game. No longer is he an unreliable defender who loses focus and lets his intensity waver. This season, Randle became one of the NBA’s most impactful and versatile defenders. He stays focused and hustles—habits that have even improved throughout the season. In the past, Randle was a black hole whenever he got an offensive touch. It disgusted fans whenever he’d barrel into a crowded paint instead of finding an open teammate. Now, he’s a playmaking hub for the Knicks, and he’s even becoming a go-to scorer because of his improved shot.Randle is now one of the best players in the NBA, and that’s all due to his mindset and the work he put in to find a new version of himself. There’s a lesson in there for all of us.By the numbers: Randle isn’t just scoring and shooting and passing better than ever before. He’s also played 113 minutes more than any other player—basically the equivalent of three extra games.Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Wing25.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.7 eFG%,7.6 net rating, 60 GPMahoney: There are scorers with a signature, and then there are scorers like Booker—comfortable in so many spaces and actions that it can be a challenge to decide how to even defend them. Booker can beat you by curling into midrange jumpers; he can exploit matchups by posting smaller guards; he can make longer wings chase him around screens, only to change directions and attack the basket once they catch up. Playing with Chris Paul helps him to leverage all of those threats in phases throughout the course of a game, but only because Booker’s breadth of ability is the skeleton key.There’s proof of that in the Suns’ minutes without Paul, when Booker runs even more pick-and-roll and keeps the offense absolutely sizzling. It doesn’t really matter whether he’s surrounded by starters or reserves; there’s always a way for Booker to get going, to improvise a bucket through relentless creativity. As a genuine three-level scorer, his power comes from possession. Defenders don’t have much choice but to take every hesitation and shot fake seriously. The next one could be the pull-up that puts the game away.By the numbers: Booker is one of eight players in NBA history with 9,000 career points through their age-24 season. The others? LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Anthony Davis, and Shaquille O’Neal.Team: Wizards (30-35) | Position: Guard31.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.2 steals, 53.1 eFG%, -1.1 net rating, 55 GPMann: Some time ago my wife and I went to a Mexican restaurant on a random weeknight to snag a bite, and we (luckily) wandered into what appeared to be the saddest karaoke night of all time. At one point a middle-aged guy resembling George R.R. Martin got up, quietly ambled across the brightly colored room to hand his CD to the DJ, and waited silently on stage for his instrumental cue. The track was immediately recognizable. It was “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” I was elated, because I expected something epically terrible and wildly entertaining. Joke was on me—it was amazing. He was obviously technically gifted, but this guy also fucking performed. The thing that really struck me, aside from his brilliance, was that his dazzling talent seemed totally out of place in this ordinary restaurant that barely clapped when he was finished. I feel like that sometimes when I’m watching Bradley Beal. I’m not saying Wizards fans don’t appreciate Beal—they adore him—and the second half of April has been fun for them, whipping up on some of the younger teams. It’s just that there are nights on League Pass when I see Beal, now hitting his absolute prime at 27 years old, on a team that’s 30-35, and think, we’ve got to get this guy in an environment where meaningful basketball is being played. To quote Colin Powell: A prime is a terrible thing to waste. OK, he didn’t actually say that, but the point stands. Beal’s 31.0 PPG (on 59.4 percent TS)—second behind Steph Curry in scoring—and his 3.3 BPM is a career high. It’s important to fully digest how dynamic Beal is. This is not a guy who you just run a weak-side pindown for or have him stand on the wing and hope he’s hitting shots off the catch. He can kill you that way, but Beal’s off-the-bounce footwork and economy of movement are among the best in the league. He’s deceptively fast on his first and second steps, and his head-and-shoulder hesitation bag is deep and lethal. He’s like a chess player who knows how many moves it’ll take to bring you down, and he refuses to stray from that design.Beal has also blossomed into a productive pick-and-roll scorer (.984 PPP, 79th percentile, per Synergy) in the decline and subsequent departure of John Wall. His reps in that area have surged in the past two seasons, and he’s been particularly productive in high ball screens, where he’s one of the most efficient players in the league at attacking the basket and getting to the line consistently. The Wizards fans I know seem content: They’ve enjoyed this guy, but moving on is understandable at this point. He’s a special prize who, if they move him, will hopefully yield a special return. By the numbers: Beal is the 12th player in NBA history to score 30-plus points per game in consecutive seasons. The first 11 comprise 10 Hall of Famers and James Harden.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Big14.4 points, 13.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 2.8 blocks, 67.9 eFG%, 15.4 net rating, 64 GPO’Connor: When you think about Gobert, what’s the first thing that pops into your mind? For some people, it’s Curry putting him in the spin cycle. Or maybe more recently, it’s him leaving D’Angelo Russell wide open to win a game. These lowlights go viral, while his moments of brilliance so rarely get noticed. Gobert induces fear into opponents when he’s lurking around the rim. The Jazz allow only 0.85 points per pick-and-roll when Gobert is defending the screen, which Second Spectrum says is the league’s highest mark of players to log at least 400 plays. It’s his presence that makes Utah third best in defensive rating this season.On offense, the threat of him flushing an alley-oop causes defenses to collapse into the paint and free up shooters. He might not shoot 3s, but he’s the reason teammates are able to get so many wide-open looks from behind the arc. The focus is often on what Gobert doesn’t do instead of what he does, which is unfortunate. But Gobert will keep on producing, even if no one is noticing.By the numbers: On shots within 6 feet of the basket, opposing players are shooting 14 percentage points worse than expected with Gobert as the closest defender, per NBA.com—the greatest differential for any player who’s defended at least 250 shots.Team: Celtics (34-31) | Position: Wing26.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.1 steals, 53.1 eFG%, 2.9 net rating, 58 GPMahoney: What a strange season it’s been for Tatum, who tested positive for COVID back in January, returned to one of the most turbulent Celtics seasons in recent memory, and then moved his game forward while managing lingering, long-haul symptoms. Just a few weeks ago, Tatum revealed that he’s been using an inhaler before games to help with his breathing. You wouldn’t know he needed it by the way he’s cutting, posting, and breaking down defenders—especially as his production hit season-high marks in April. As always, it’s the balance that impresses most. Tatum is the kind of star who keeps every option open, allowing teammates to be their best selves and Celtics coach Brad Stevens to troubleshoot as needed. If it’s easiest for Tatum to go to work from the midpost or top of the arc, he can—but his game is no less effective if he’s moved around the floor, across positions, or between defensive matchups. Any two-way player of Tatum’s size is an incredible strategic luxury, but his technical prowess has made him indispensable. The only reason Boston’s season feels underwhelming is because Tatum is good enough to raise expectations.By the numbers: Tatum has more than doubled his assist rate from two seasons ago, from 10 percent of teammates’ baskets to 21 this season.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard26.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.3 steals, 56.4 eFG%, 5.4 net rating, 48 GPMann: Irving’s enigmatic existence as a hoops star is bizarre and somewhat unprecedented, to the point that it’s difficult to have a conversation purely about him as a basketball player. But the fact remains that Irving is still one of the most impactful offensive players on the planet. His multifaceted scoring—driven by his command of misdirection and his ability to decelerate hard in the middle portion of the floor—makes him extremely difficult to cover on an island, in open space. With heavy-load scorers next to him, his versatility is especially hard to take away. It’s been typical volume and typical efficiency from Irving, but he’s as active as ever getting downhill. He’s scored more points in the paint than ever before, and among jump shooters who’ve put up 400-plus attempts, Irving is seventh in the league in field goal percentage. He’s also fifth in isolation points per chance at 1.138. What Brooklyn as a whole has done this season is equally bizarre and unprecedented—not since Wynton Marsalis and Willie Nelson teamed up (just go with it) have we had megastars come together on a big stage with virtually no rehearsal time, but that’s what KD, Kyrie, and the Beard are doing. This trio has played a whopping 186 minutes together in only seven games, and yet the Nets are second in the East at 43-22, and Irving is the most consistent producer throughout that time. It speaks to the talent and experience of these three stars that the general assumption is that they’ll still be extremely difficult to stop from reaching the Finals.By the numbers: Evidence of the lethality of Irving’s shooting: He’s at 38.1 percent from 3 this season, which is comfortably above average in the NBA … yet his worst 3-point percentage in half a decade.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Wing21.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.1 steals, 50.7 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 48 GPDevine: Jimmy entered the bubble last summer as a five-time All-Star widely regarded as one of the finest two-way players in the sport. Inside, he became something more, fully embracing the odd-as-hell circumstances, fueling Miami’s thrilling run to the Finals, and authoring a pair of unforgettable performances against the Lakers before bowing out. The Heat, on the whole, have struggled in fits and starts this season to try to recapture the magic they found in Disney World.Butler, though? He’s been playing like he never left:Injury, illness, and inconsistency have left holes all over the Heat’s roster this season. Butler has stretched his game to try to fill them, scoring and facilitating efficiently in a larger offensive role while continuing to act as an All-Defensive Team–caliber stopper on opponents’ top options. I’m not sure the Heat will find enough answers by the play-in games to replicate last season’s run. I am sure, though, that I would want nothing to do with a win-or-go-home game against Jimmy, who showed in the bubble he’s good enough to be the best player on any floor he steps on, and who’s spent this season proving that wasn’t a fluke.By the numbers: Butler is shooting just 20.4 percent on 3-pointers, yet he’s still averaging 21.5 points per game. That’s the worst long-range accuracy for any of the 30 qualified players this season averaging at least 20 points. Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing23.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 56.0 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 49 GPMahoney: As a public figure, George can be rather bumbling—tripping through odd sound bites, needless excuses, and one inexplicable beef after another. As a player, he’s just smooth as hell. The second act of George’s career began when he really cleaned up his handle, and ever since, he’s shown how easy scoring 20 points a night can be. This is his most efficient season yet. Whether he’s handling the ball or angling to get open, George moves at a glide, slinking around defenders and through traffic. His game is just smooth enough to be occasionally frustrating. If you can get anywhere you want on the floor, why not get to the rim? It’s an easy criticism, and given the way George produces and defends, a largely irrelevant one. Plus, if your jumper looked this good, you might just fall in love with it, too.The truth is that George does so much more to paper over the Clippers’ limitations than he’s given credit for, starting with the way he’s shared playmaking duties for one of the highest-achieving offenses in the league. His all-around game gives a weird, somewhat flawed roster the credentials of a serious contender.By the numbers: Out of 28 players this season attempting at least seven 3-pointers per game, Steph Curry is naturally first in accuracy. George is second.Team: Pelicans (29-36) | Position: Point Big27.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.6 blocks, 62.1 eFG%, 1.8 net rating, 59 GPO’Connor: What a privilege it is to watch this man hoop. Only 20 years old and averaging a Shaq-like stat line of 27 points on 62 percent from the field. He’s a dominant force who keeps getting better. This season, we’ve seen Zion morph into a playmaker who brings the ball up the court and runs pick-and-roll. Amazingly, he still has so much untapped upside to be unleashed—as long as he continues to develop his ball handling and jumper, and the pieces around him improve.By the numbers: Williamson is taking 13.3 shots per game in the restricted area. That’s 2.2 more attempts than anyone else in any season in the play-by-play era (dating back to 1996-97).Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Guard16.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.4 steals, 55.2 eFG%, 6.5 net rating, 63 GPDevine: The bubble gave us our first indicator that Phoenix would be good. The second, more telling one, though, was that Chris Paul wanted to go there.CP3 doesn’t waste time. He’s here to optimize every second, whether it’s walking the dog to try to preserve possessions late in the game, or dramatically changing his diet to try to recover the step he seemed to be losing as he aged. He proved in a surprising All-NBA turn in Oklahoma City last season that he remains a Chopped grand champion, still capable of taking whatever’s in the cupboard and elevating it, and he looked at a Phoenix roster that already featured Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Mikal Bridges and said, “Yeah, I can work with this.”And work he has, turning in one of the most productive seasons ever by a guard on the wrong side of 35 while serving as the straw that stirs the drink for a dynamite team that has blown away even the most optimistic preseason expectations. Booker’s the headliner, but the Suns operate like a classic CP3 team: slow-paced and careful with the ball, elite in the half court, disciplined on defense, excellent in crunch time. He augments both Phoenix’s poise and its snarl.Bringing in Paul to replace Ricky Rubio promised to raise Phoenix’s floor. But Paul continuing to play at this level also vaults the Suns’ ceiling, all the way up to the rarefied air reserved for title contenders.By the numbers: Paul is taking 63 percent of his shots from the midrange, per Cleaning the Glass—tied for the largest portion in the league. And he’s making 53 percent of them, which ranks in the 95th percentile.Team: Trail Blazers (36-29) | Position: Guard28.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.6 eFG%, 3.1 net rating, 59 GPMahoney: Forgive me for belaboring the Dame Time of it all, but how is it even possible that a 6-foot-2 guard could be so good in the highest-leverage situations as to completely bail out an otherwise one-sided team? The break-even Blazers are one of the NBA’s best outfits in the clutch, owed mostly to Lillard’s daring and shot-making with the game on the line. We really can’t overstate the value of that—especially when Lillard’s late-game performance could be the difference between Portland finishing the season as a play-in team and disastrously sliding out of the picture entirely. The one shot, game on the line conversation can be a bit reductive, but it’s also revealing to see how opponents react to that premise. Lillard can push a playoff-level team to full-on crisis. Panic switches, flailing miscommunications, out-of-character traps—anything and everything is possible when Dame has the ball in his hands late in a close game, and the Blazers rightly trust him not just to hit shots, but to make the best possible decisions. In that capacity, Lillard delivers for the full 48. He manages the game, he investigates the coverage, and when the bell finally tolls, he rips out an opponent’s still-beating heart. By the numbers: Lillard has scored 149 points in clutch situations this season, per NBA.com. That’s 20 more than anyone else.Team: Mavericks (36-28) | Position: Guard28.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.0 steals, 55.6 eFG%, 3.8 net rating, 58 GPO’Connor: Luka placed fourth in MVP voting in 2020 at age 20, in only his second season. It was the greatest sophomore season anyone has ever had, except arguably LeBron when he averaged 27-7-7 in 2004-05. LeBron placed sixth in MVP voting that season and wouldn’t win his first until 2009. Luka won’t win his first in the 2020-21 season, but he belongs in the top-five conversation again because he’s even better than he was last season. He’s better at shooting. He’s better at defense. He’s better at leading a team through adversity. He has carried the Mavericks through Kristaps Porzingis’s absences, a constantly changing rotation due to injuries, and the second-most games missed due to the COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Dallas is competing for a top-six seed in the playoffs largely because of another leap by Luka.By the numbers: Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are the only players in NBA history with multiple All-NBA appearances through their age-21 seasons. Doncic will join them this season.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: Big21.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.8 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 29 GPMann: It’s true that Davis has barely played this season. He missed 30 games starting in mid-February, but he’s still in the conversation for most versatile, utterly dominant two-way frontcourt player in the world. I actually had him ranked much higher.Offensively, it’s been an unremarkable season by Brow’s standards: He’s less active at the rim and he’s leaned heavily on his face-up game. Maybe that’s to avoid risk of injury, but I think that’s eaten into his overall efficiency.Defensively, he’s still a force. AD’s recovery speed, positional intelligence, and general disruptiveness make him one of the most impactful and skilled defenders in the NBA. At full health and fully humming, I don’t think there’s anyone better. It’s a simple calculus: He gives a ton and takes a ton away. Last season, among defenders who logged at least 1,000 possessions guarding screens, Davis had the lowest points per chance allowed in the league at .877. He was only put in position to defend screens 20.04 times per 100 possessions, the second-lowest amount among that sample. In other words, it was a fool’s errand to go at him.His incredible catch radius on the offensive end also allows him to bother or stifle passing activity in and around the paint, and everybody in the league knows it. Driving in Davis’s general direction is enough to create indecision or hesitation. Back in the mid-2000s, Bravo ran a special about the scariest movie moments. In it, panelists described what made watching Jaws so terrifying—after encountering that terror, you were never swimming in open water with a clear mind again. That’s what it’s like to attempt to create offense around Anthony Davis. He lingers in the back of your mind.His efficiencies in this area are down from last season, but the glimpses indicate that he’s still got the ability to flip the switch on in the playoffs. Watch Doncic punt on challenging him initially on this drive, kick it to Kleber, who fakes and drives at Davis and also decides not to attack him. Davis basically makes this a no-fly zone, challenging this skip pass to Luka to the point where its float time allows him to recover and heavily contest the shot. He’s a monster.By the numbers: Davis is struggling with his 3-point percentage in a small sample—but he’s converting at a career-best clip from both the restricted area and the midrange.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 11 assists, 1.3 steals, 54.5 eFG%, 2.7 net rating, 34 GPDevine: “I don’t know, man. It’s been, like, three years of almost nothing but isolation. Can Harden even play regular basketball anymore?”As it turns out: yep.“All right, sure, he can run actual plays and stuff, and he’s willing to cut his usage damn near in half when he plays with KD and Kyrie. But what about when they’re not on the floor? Is he going to be able to carry this team like he did in Houston?”Again: yep.“Wait: So when he’s flanked by Hall of Famers, he lays back and runs the offense like Magic, and when he’s not, he snaps right back to being a do-everything MVP type?”Mm-hmm.“... Shit, that’s pretty impressive.”Yep!By the numbers: Harden leads the league in isolation possessions since moving to Brooklyn, but he’s averaging only eight isos per game—about half of his average in his last two full seasons in Houston. He also ranks in the 86th percentile in isolation efficiency.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Big28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, 59.9 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 54 GPMahoney: Tempting as it may be to think of offense and defense as discrete from one another, every push in transition blurs the line between them. Giannis absolutely dominates these sorts of gray areas. If a smaller opponent has to pick him up in transition, he dunks. If a like-sized defender sprints in his path but meets Giannis too late, he dunks. If the Bucks set a drag screen for Giannis and the defense is forced to switch, he dunks. Overreact in his direction at any time, and a knock-down shooter will get target practice from beyond the arc. You can apply this same sort of no-win logic to many of the game’s in-between spaces, or any scenario that would force a less-than-optimal defender to contend with a titan.His size just makes it too easy for Milwaukee to turn the smallest momentary advantage into the highest-efficiency shots. Quality playoff teams try to minimize those vulnerabilities as best they can, but there’s only so much that can be done to stay out of defensive rotation, where Antetokounmpo can step over smaller guards and create opportunities from offensive rebounds. Any hope that opponents have of creating their own easy points in transition runs into the same massive problem: the reigning Defensive Player of the Year with the same size advantage, ready to meet them at the rim and ruin their day. Chaos is an inescapable part of the NBA game. Giannis has managed to make it his own.By the numbers: Across his two MVP seasons, Giannis averaged 28.5 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. This season, he’s averaging 28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. He’s the same player, with nearly the exact same stat line, as when he won back-to-back MVPs.Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing25.5 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.6 steals, 57.1 eFG%, 11.5 net rating, 47 GPO’Connor: We so often praise Kawhi for his defensive brilliance and his go-to scoring greatness. But he’s also improved over the years as a playmaker. This season, he’s averaging a career-high 5.1 assists and using the pick-and-roll to destroy defenses. Through May 1, 114 players have logged at least 400 possessions as a pick-and-roll ball handler and Leonard ranks first, leading the Clippers to score 1.12 points per chance, according to Second Spectrum. Leonard is still a score-first player, but adding a new dimension to his game has made him deadlier than ever.By the numbers: Leonard is averaging 2.6 assists per turnover this season. The best prior ratio of his career was 1.9.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Big28.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 blocks, 62.4 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 28 GPMann: The buildup to the 2020-21 season was colored by the anxiety of whether or not Durant would be the Slim Reaper whom we’ve watched in awe for the past decade. His season has lacked rhythm in most every sense, but his return to the court has been wildly satisfying, as he’s proved that he’s still one of the world’s most elite shot-makers. He’s been especially efficient in isolation and shooting off the catch, and his effectiveness as an off-the-dribble shooter shows very little sign of having fallen off. Among players attempting at least 100 pull-up jumpers, Durant’s second in the NBA in effective field goal percentage, per Second Spectrum.If the Nets stay healthy and ramp this thing up, they are a gravitational nightmare for opponents. That’s especially nauseating for defenses when you consider that Durant has stared the biggest moments in the sport in the face and coolly plunged the dagger.By the numbers: The last time Durant was healthy, in 2018-19, he had the second-best offensive rating for a team that set a league record for offensive efficiency. This season, Durant is doing one better, with the best offensive rating for a team on pace to set a league record for efficiency.Team: Warriors (33-32) | Position: Guard31.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.2 steals, 60.9 eFG%, 3.2 net rating, 56 GPO’Connor: Despite having the worst supporting cast since Golden State’s run began, Steph is producing comparably to his unanimous MVP season in 2015-16. We are entering a turning point of Curry’s career. An identity crisis looms for the Warriors; James Wiseman has struggled as a rookie, Draymond Green lost his jumper, and Klay Thompson’s future is uncertain following two straight missed seasons. Steph is 33, and the competition in the West is steeper than it’s been … maybe ever. But Curry has proved to still be one of the few talents who can single-handedly lead his team to the playoffs. With a little more help, the Warriors could soon be back in the championship conversation.By the numbers: Among all player-seasons in NBA history with at least a 30 percent usage rate and 1,000 minutes played, the three best true shooting percentages are, in order: Curry in 2018, Curry in 2016, and now Curry in 2021.Team: 76ers (44-21) | Position: Big29.3 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.4 blocks, 54.5 eFG%, 11.3 net rating, 45 GPMahoney: The biggest revolution in Embiid’s game this season was a pivot. As a back-to-the-basket player, the Sixers center was a clear All-Star; as a face-up post player, he might be the most dominant player in the sport. Reorienting his game has allowed Embiid to do more of the heavy manufacturing necessary to really sustain an offense. His usage is up, far ahead of any other center. His scoring is up. His free throw attempts are up. And so long as he continues to hit midrange shots at a 47 percent clip, there’s not really a damn thing a defense can do to stop him. It’s so much harder to pressure Embiid when he’s already positioned to see double teams coming. There’s no blind side left to exploit; any attempt to force the ball out of Embiid’s hands is an invitation for a quick pass out to a wide-open 3-pointer, or a sales opportunity for Embiid to flail through his crowding defenders for yet another trip to the foul line.Yet doubling Embiid might still be the right call—if only because there are so few defenders big enough to get a hand in his face and mobile enough to keep up with his footwork. We know Embiid has entered a rare class because the only options to try to contain him are bad ones. Playing against the Sixers these days just means learning to live with his dominance. By the numbers: Embiid is averaging 12.7 free throw attempts per 36 minutes—breaking a league record held by Wilt Chamberlain since 1961-62, when he tallied 12.6 attempts per 36.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: LeBron25.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 0.6 blocks, 57.8 eFG%, 9.4 net rating, 43 GPMann: I’ve had a fun time fleshing out this list, but I cannot in good conscience allow you people to walk away from any list where LeBron is not no. 1. And listen—I adore Nikola Jokic. I think he’s the most talented offensive center to walk the earth. At the same time, I’m trying to savor these last chances I have to appreciate LeBron, one of the truly great sports brands of all time. Unless you’re a bitter fan or you love these back-and-forth “ringz culture” pissing matches, you should do the same! Rally all of your thoughts behind this American icon!  LeBron is Brad Pitt smiling over the steering wheel in slo-mo in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. LeBron is Coke using Helvetica in a full-page ad.LeBron is one of the surest, most foundational things that we have. Don’t you crave stability and normalcy? What the hell are we doing, doubting him? After the year we’ve had, LeBron winning another title would be like the totem at the end of Inception falling to the table, revealing that we’re back from whatever awful nightmare that just was.All that aside: At 36 years old, it remains incredible that he’s able to uphold the scale of his impact while moving less than ever. It’s hard to blame him. LeBron is hunting rarified accolades, and at this stage of his career, with this many miles on the tires, he has to prioritize staying in the race until the end over sprinting to be clearly ahead at the third stage. He’s the baddest man alive until further notice.By the numbers: When LeBron plays (not counting the game he was hurt early), the Lakers have 14 losses versus 28 wins. When LeBron doesn’t play (or is hurt early), the Lakers also have 14 losses—but with only eight wins.Team: Nuggets (43-22) | Position: Point Big26.2 points, 10.9 rebounds, 8.5 assists, 0.7 blocks, 60.6 eFG%, 7.6 net rating, 64 GPDevine: Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space:That’s a tidy visualization of the degree to which Jokic has separated himself from all other players this season in a slew of advanced metrics—including estimated plus-minus, value over replacement player, box plus-minus, win shares, and FiveThirtyEight’s wins above replacement—to make the most difficult leap in the sport: from All-Star to MVP favorite.The 26-year-old has used Denver’s invigorating run in the bubble as a springboard, coming off his curtailed offseason in the best shape of his career and translating that into one of the most impressive offensive campaigns in NBA history. That’s not hyperbole: Jokic has married scoring efficiency, playmaking volume, and sheer offensive workload to a level that only Magic Johnson, LeBron James, and James Harden have ever reached. This is where I remind you that we are talking about a 6-foot-11, 284-pound center, one I compared three months ago—lovingly and favorably!—to a Mack truck.This year’s model of Jokic is a basketball futurist’s fever dream realized—the myth of the next Dirk Nowitzki and Arvydas Sabonis made manifest in one peerless package. Whether he can carry a wounded Nuggets team through a Western Conference littered with the kind of big-wing playmakers who have come to dominate postseason play remains to be seen; if my life depended on winning one game, I can’t swear he’d be my first pick. If I got him, though, I wouldn’t hate my chances. Because nobody—nobody—has played basketball better this season than Nikola Jokic.By the numbers: Combining points, assists, and screen assists, Jokic has created 58 points per game this season—a whopping five ahead of second place. The only other players above 50 are Harden (53), Doncic (52), Domantas Sabonis (51), Russell Westbrook (51), and Giannis (51). An SB Nation affiliate site\n",

      "www.cbr.com15 DC Comics That Can Be Considered The Greatest Of All TimeWith thousands of different comics in the DC library, it can be difficult to determine which are the best, but most would agree on these.Comics have come into their own as an art form, and one of the biggest reasons for that is DC. Pioneering the art of comics for mature readers in the mid-80s, they let some of the greatest creators the medium has ever seen run wild, creating timeless stories set in the DC Universe and beyond.The timeless epics of DC Comics have served to bring comics to the mainstream, making them more than just stories about superheroes beating on each other. They've transcended their genre and are among the best comics of all time.RELATED: DC's First 11 Silver Age Comics (In Chronological Order)Updated on February 28, 2022: While the earliest issues of Detective Comics are largely criticized for problematic stories that used bad stereotypes of the time, the publisher grew after the introduction of characters like Batman and Superman, which kicked off the company's new direction. DC Comics has spent decades telling amazing and unforgettable stories that have changed the industry, so we've gathered some of the best DC comics that highlight how far the company has come since its beginnings in 1937.Prior to the reboot of Superman by John Byrne in The Man of Steel, Alan Moore and Julius Scwartz teamed up to tell the final story of the Silver Age Superman in 1986's Superman: Whatever Happened To The Man In Tomorrow. 10 years after the disappearance of the Man of Steel, a reporter investigates his final moments through an interview with Lois Lane that highlights the final battles with his rogues' gallery. The comic is an iconic send-off for DC's most popular character and has gone down in history as one of the greatest, even if it isn't exactly canon.Mike Grell was brought on to reboot Green Arrow in 1987 with The Longboy Hunters. This was because the character had continued to decrease in popularity over the years. Green Arrow abandoned the trick arrows he'd used for decades and adopted a more street-level style of crime-fighting that defined the character for decades.The Longboy Hunters reunited Green Arrow and Black Canary as he moved to Seattle. There, his past came back to haunt him. The three-issue series is a gritty and violent reboot of the character that shocked and impressed viewers.One of the most well-known storylines from the fan-favorite Legion of Super-Heroes is \"The Great Darkness Saga\" by Paul Levitz and Kieth Giffen, which featured nearly every member of the team that had appeared over their long history in the DC Universe. A villain known as the Master begins gathering powerful artifacts and draining energy from the Legion's deadliest villains.RELATED: 10 Members of the Justice League That Would Be Better In The Legion of Super-HeroesHe also builds a powerful Daxamite army with his goal to take over the universe. The storyline brought the past and the future of the DC Universe together as the Master was revealed to be Darkseid of the New Gods, resulting in one of the Legion's biggest and most memorable battles.Mark Waid and Alex Ross explored a possible future of the DC universe in 1996's Kingdom Come, which followed a disillusioned minister as he was joined by The Spectre to bear witness to a battle between the older generation of heroes and the next generation that threatened the world.Kingdom Come took place after the heroes of the Justice League had largely retired, while their children spent their days fighting against each other for fun or turf that endangered humanity. The classic heroes are forced to return, though the extreme decisions made by each side further split them apart and threaten to bring an end to the world in one of DC's greatest stories.Alan Moore and Brian Bolland gave fans the definitive origin of The Joker in 1988's Batman: The Killing Joke, although the graphic novel wasn't considered canon when it was first released. The Killing Joke featured dynamic art and in-depth exploration of the twisted relationship between Batman and Joker.The graphic novel is also known for its deep dive into the madness of The Joker as he takes his vengeance against Commissioner Gordon by shooting, paralyzing, and abusing his daughter Barbara Gordon in one of DC's darkest moments. The ending of The Killing Joke is also one that's sure to stick with fans, making it one of the best DC graphic novels.Putting Watchmen on this list is a no-brainer. Widely considered the greatest comic of all time, writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons's 1985-1986 classic brought the superhero comic kicking and screaming into the mainstream. Moore pulled out all the stops for this one and Gibbons's detailed and gritty art brought the whole thing to life.RELATED: Watchmen: Each Character's Charlton Comics Inspiration, ExplainedWith its in-depth look at the psychology of those who put on costumes, its twist ending, and so much more, Watchmen set the tone for future of comics. It's almost a cliche at this point to call it the greatest of all time.Batman is one of the most popular characters in the comics medium and The Dark Knight Returns, by writer/artist Frank Miller, is among the Caped Crusader's greatest stories. Along with Watchmen and Art Spiegelman's Maus, The Dark Knight Returns is credited with revolutionizing the comics medium. Starring an older Batman coming out of retirement to clean up Gotham City, it brought Batman into modern times.For years, he was looked at by the public as the campy '60s TV version; however, TDKR changed all that. It was the first of Miller's one-two Batman punch, followed by Batman: Year One, and still one of his best works.Crisis On Infinite Earths wasn't the first big event book in comics - that distinction goes to Marvel's Contest Of Champions - but it changed the way readers looked at event stories and set the stage for what was to come. Writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Perez's timeless classic is still one of the best event books of them all almost forty years later.What makes it so important (and unlike any crossover before it) is the massive and lasting change it brought. It changed the DC Universe forever, both streamlining it and opening it up to new fans. On top of that, it killed off two of DC's biggest characters – Supergirl and Barry Allen – and put a bow on the Silver Age concepts that had driven DC for decades. An amazing superhero story, it holds up all these years later.Infinite Crisis, by writer Geoff Johns and artists Phil Jimenez, George Perez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway, is the sequel to Crisis On Infinite Earths. It's easily the greatest event book of the twenty-first century. Building on the events of its successor, it pits the heroes of the DC Universe against an unforeseen threat that wants to rewrite reality.RELATED: 10 DC Characters Who Could Destroy The Universe If They Wanted ToInfinite Crisis has it all: great superhero action, a respect for the history of the DC Universe, and a tale about the importance of heroism in dark times. Much like CoIE, it's had lasting repercussions. It's served to show that even in the dark, gritty modern comic industry, a little hope can go a long way.Alan Moore's work at DC is among some of the greatest of all time, and his time on Swamp Thing is what really brought him into the public consciousness. That all started with Saga Of The Swamp Thing #21 where he, joined by artist Steve Bissette, changed everything everyone thought they knew about Swamp Thing.This issue started a revolution and changed horror comics forever. Gone were the hokey monster comics of yesteryear, replaced by something more intelligent and stylish. This one comic laid the groundwork for DC's British Invasion, and their Vertigo imprint is still one of the most well-regarded comics to star Swamp Thing.Writer Grant Morrison and artist Chaz Truog's Animal Man #1-4 was a successful re-imagining of the Silver Age superhero, but it was still just a run of the mill superhero book with some flourishes of Moore (like every other DC book by a writer from the UK at the time). However, the fifth issue, \"The Coyote Gospel,\" changed all of that by playing into the larger narrative Morrison would bring to the series.Featuring Animal Man hunting a mysterious monster in the desert, it's much more than it seems and plays into the meta-fictional narrative that would come to define Morrison's run on the book. A truly groundbreaking comic, it showed just how special a talent Morrison could be.DC is a company that completes a lot of firsts, including having the first superteam: the Justice Society of America. In fact, DC's roster of Golden Age heroes is pretty much unparalleled in all comics, and they took center stage in The Golden Age by writer James Robinson and artist Paul Smith. An Elseworlds tale set after WWII, it saw the heroes trying to get back to normal after the war and the dawn of a new threat.RELATED: Grant Morrison's 10 Best DC Stories, RankedRobinson and Smith were just about able to fit every Golden Age DC hero into this four-issue masterpiece, and it's a great primer for people who want to learn about some lesser-known (but no less great) DC heroes.DC's Vertigo imprint was a treasure trove of amazing creator-owned stories, and it doesn't get much better than Grant Morrison's The Invisibles. This mind-bending postcard from the '90s is a travelogue through sex, drugs, violence, conspiracies, and everything under the sun.The story, spread out over three volumes and seven story arcs, tells the tale of the Invisibles – a group of freedom fighters battling against the tyranny of the Outer Church, extra-dimensional aliens who control everything. Morrison and the numerous artists they worked with let their imaginations run wild on this one. It's full of amazing characters, breathtaking action and adventure, straight-up weirdness, and more heart than one expects.Neil Gaiman's The Sandman was one of the most popular - and best written - books of its time, and it still holds up all these years later. The story of his Darkness Dream of the Endless and his family, The Sandman brought high literature to comics in a way it never had before.The Sandman is the kind of comic that can be given to someone who isn't a comic fan, and they'll love it. It showed the world just how great a writer Gaiman could be. Few stories before or since have reached the same heights of characterization and plot. And as a result, it remains a classic of the medium that is one of a kind.Superman is the first costumed superhero in comics history, and his greatest tale is All-Star Superman by writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely. It begins, strangely enough, with Lex Luthor's ultimate victory. Foiling one of Luthor's schemes, Superman gets an overdose of solar radiation – one that will supercharge his cells but kill him.Morrison combines Silver Age concepts with his incomparable imagination and, combined with Quitely's amazing pencils, creates a Superman story for the ages. It hits all the right spots and shows why Superman is one of humanity's greatest fictional characters.NEXT: 10 DC Comics That Are Way Darker Than The DCEUDavid Harth has been reading comics for close to 30 years.

      "The Best Marvel Comics of 2021!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansNovember 24, 2021 by Dave 2 Comments After the pandemic-impacted 2020, Marvel’s 2021 is slowly but surely back on track, with a wide variety of excellent comics. All in all, it’s a good time to be a Marvel fan, and I’m listing out my favorite picks for those looking to dive in.It’s an interesting year for Marvel, three years after the launch of the “Fresh Start” era, as some of the line’s biggest titles (Black Panther, Immortal Hulk, Venom, & on a technicality, Jonathan Hickman’s X-Men) wind down throughout the year. Even with that turnover, “Fresh Start” is heartily sustained through the Krakoa era of X-Men, an exciting new Marvel Space Age, and a healthy variety of quality throughout the broader universe. Honestly, even some of the big time runs I’m least enthused by (Jason Aaron’s Avengers and Nick Spencer’s Amazing Spider-Man) are remarkably consistent, and offer plenty of intriguing moments. It’s a truly good time to be a fan of Marvel Comics.Below you’ll find my picks for the best Marvel Comics of 2021, updated throughout the year to reflect new books I’m excited about. Check them out here, and let me know anything good I should be reading in the comments!Honorable Mentions: Carnage: Black White & Red, Taskmaster, Black Widow, Beta Ray Bill, Power Pack, Way of XBest Comics of 2021 (So Far)!Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!Best Marvel Comics of 2020Creators: Zeb Wells, Stephen Segovia, Carmen Carnero, Ariana MaherRelevant Issues: #8 to #18Hellions is so good, such a stunning blend of heart and humor, that we don’t even talk any more about how weird it is that a contender for best X-book stars Mister Sinister (yeah), Psylocke (yep), Havok (ok), John Greycrow (…), Wild Child (…), Empath (…) and Nanny and Orphanker (what?!). In so many ways, it’s the promise of the Krakoa era fulfilled, where any mutant can be a star, and totally revamped concepts can thrive.Honestly, the only thing that *hurts* Hellions at this point is the launch of books like SWORD and Way of X that are inherently more integrated into the big picture of what matters in X-Men comics right now. But in many ways, that’s also freeing, allowing Hellions to just be the laugh-out-loud Suicide Squad reimagining we didn’t know we needed.Creators: Al Ewing, Valerio Schiti, Marte Gracia, Ariana MaherRelevant Issues: SWORD #2 to #12Creators: Al Ewing, Juann Cabal, Federico Blee, Cory PetitRelevant Issues: Guardians of the Galaxy #10 to #16, Annual #1, GotG #17 to #21Al Ewing’s been good and properly cosmic for a long time, as evidenced by such contemporary must-reads as Ultimates and honestly a good chunk of Immortal Hulk! Giving him the reigns to Marvel’s cosmic landscape – which has been oddly unfocused despite the cosmic focus of events like Empyre and King in Black – is a huge win, and has enormous potential for fans of Marvel heroes across the galaxy.Between the excellence of SWORD (a part of the X-Men’s “Reign of X”) and the increasing complexity and diverse shifts of Guardians of the Galaxy, Ewing’s Marvel Age of Space is shaping up to potentially compete with the halycon days of Annihilation-era mid 2000’s Marvel Cosmic.Creators: Chip Zdarsky, Marco Checceto, Marcio Menyz, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #26 to #37The final Daredevil issue of 2020, Daredevil #25, ended on a major turn for the excellent Chip Zdarsky and Marco Checceto run, one which offers the potential for him to move his run further out of the shadow of all the great Daredevil runs that preceded his. If you don’t know what that turn is – somehow, still – get to reading Daredevil, and skip ahead to the next pick!So.Starting with King in Black tie-ins, the 2021 version of Daredevil follows Elektra Natchios as the Daredevil of Hell’s Kitchen while Matt Murdock fights for survival in prison. And as so often happens when a known Marvel player takes on a legacy mantle (here’s looking at you Bucky, Sam, Flash, Carol and Shuri), it makes for great comics!Creators: Jed MacKay, CF Villa, Brian Reber, Ferran DelgadoRelevant Issues: #2 to #7, Annual #1, #8 to #13I’ve probably told this story before, but I’ll never forget Yokira Cebulski holding up a copy of J. Scott Campbell’s cheesecake pin-up cover of Black Cat #1 at C2E2, excitedly asking “Who likes Black Cat?!” and the mixture of confused, muted clapping that followed. It’s not like Felicia Hardy isn’t a popular, enduring supporting player in the Spider-Man Universe, but if there was a market for a genuinely great Black Cat ongoing, surely that would have presented itself before 2019?Yet, Jed MacKay and Travel Foreman turned the story of Black Cat into one of Marvel’s best series, and MacKay impressively continues the feat in 2021, forced to relaunch Black Cat with a new #1 as part of the King in Black event, and sticking the landing time and time again. A huge part of the hook of this comic is that MacKay and company have turned Felicia’s story into a heist across every corner of the Marvel Universe, deliberately bouncing from reference point to reference point in a way that is seriously entertaining for longtime Marvel fans. Plus, I’ve truly never been more entertained by Felicia and her posse, one of the most entertaining “Crews” in Marvel Comics of the past few years.Creators: Kieron Gillen, Esad Ribic, Matt Wilson, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #1 to #6I used to make jokes that Jack Kirby’s Eternals were primarily good for helping readers get some rest on those sleepless nights, and well, I still will from time to time, but 2021 is certainly the most invested I’ve ever been in the Eternals. A lot of that has to do with the impending introduction to the MCU, with much of my enthusiasm also boosted by Gillen and Ribic’s ongoing Eternals.Eternals is Gillen’s return to the Marvel Universe after four years away, and it’s a brilliant fit, with the very open, yet very vast mythology of Eternals as his playground. Combine that sprawling mythology with Esad Ribic’s, who has one of superhero comics highest batting average across runs on Thor: God of Thunder and 2015’s Secret Wars, and Eternals fits right into the exciting creator-driven world-building of the likes of X-Men and Hulk franchises.Creators: Al Ewing, Joe Bennett, Ruy Jose, Chris O’Halloran, Cory PetitRelevant Issues: #42 to #50There’s really no right time for Immortal Hulk to end, as Al Ewing, Joe Bennet and team have crafted a take on Hulk so instantly iconic, I can’t fathom any readers who won’t feel a tremondous absence following the run’s conclusion with 2021’s Immortal Hulk #50. Nonetheless, Ewing and co. have certainly earned the right to give their saga the rarest of rewards in comics: a proper ending on their own terms.Immortal Hulk will go down as a constant presence on “Best of Marvel Comics” lists in years to come, and with the exception of Greg Pak’s long run starting with “Planet Hulk,” it’s honestly hard to even consider other contenders for Marvel’s best Hulk work (no, I didn’t forget about Peter David’s very long – and frequently very interesting! – work).I don’t want to see Immortal Hulk go, but you know what? Sometimes the green door beckons.Creators: Jed McKay, Alessandro Cappuccio, Rachelle Rosenberg, Corey PetitRelevant Issues: Moon Knight #1 to #6Moon Knight isn’t quite at Daredevil levels of strongest comics per ounce in the Marvel Universe, but the last decade has solidified the story of Marc Spector and Mr. Knight as one of the more interesting creative tapestries in superhero comics. Writer Jed McKay continues an incredible hot streak with Marvel Comics, and artist Alessandro Cappuccio and colorist Rachelle Rosenberg are performing at a superstar level.I think the most exciting thing about this relaunched Moon Knight is that McKay and team are leaning into the full modern history of what’s made the character exciting, from Declan Shalvey’s Mr. Knight redesign to Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino’s surreal psychological mystery. McKay is capturing Spector’s Judaism, disassociative identity disorder,  and feelings of depression as a failed mercenary turned West Coast Avenger. It’s a captivating read, and a series I look forward to reading for a good long time.Creators: Jonathan Hickman, Mahmud Asrar, Sunny Gho, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #17 to #21, Inferno #1 to #4Ranking “X-Men” in 2021 is a little tricky because the Jonathan Hickman written run on the title ends during the summer Hellfire Gala with issue #21, before Gerry Duggan and Pepe Larraz take over with a relaunched “X-Men” #1 for the remainder of the year.As it stands, the Hickman run on X-Men ends on a powerfully strong note through issues #18 to the conclusion, as Hickman returns to plot threads seeded early in his run (issue #5’s Children of the Vault return in X-Men #18 to #19, and issue #6’s story of Mystique, Destiny, and Nimrod returns in X-Men #20). For my money, the run ends in precisely the way House of X and Powers of X promised, with huge payoffs on seeds, mysteries and ideas that make this era of X-Men so exciting.Creators: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Leonard Kirk, Matt Milla, Joe SabinoRelevant Issues: Captain America #27 to #302021 has been a year of critics and fans *finally* coming to terms with the weight and approach of Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Marvel Comics, both as Black Panther ended with his second set of 25 issues (a series that belongs on this list but for the fact that only 2 issues actually came out *this year*), and as Coates Captain America cemented more of its fascinating focus and purpose.That Captain America is a political work should not come as a surprise to anyone who has been reading comics since – checks notes – World War II, but Coates’ late 2020 and 2021 issues of Cap are particularly incisive of this American cultural moment.I’ve said as much before, but Marvel fans are going to look back at the five years of Coates as a major force in the Marvel Universe, and lament that this work wasn’t more fervently appreciated in its time.Creators: Vita Ayala, Rod Reis, Travis LanhamRelevant Issues: #15 to #20The X-Office’s New Mutants went from the weakest most rudderless book in the line to one of the best, and all it took was the creative overhaul adding writer Vita Ayala and artist Rod Reis. That infusion, and a newfound, much-needed focus on the youth of Krakoa, turned New Mutants into a must-read from jump.I’m consistently impressed how *much* story Ayala and Reis pack into each issue, frequently balancing no fewer than three distinct plot threads, yet somehow giving each equal weight and attention. Whether it’s the mysterious nefarious presence of the Shadow King, the growing concerns of Gabby aka Scout, or the old guard New Mutants (Karma, Dani Moonstar, Rahne Sinclair, Magik) training young mutants, this title is an absolute highlight of the Reign of X.Creators: Gene Luen Yang, Dike Ruan, Triona Farrell, Travis LanhamRelevant Issues: Shang-Chi (2020) #1 to #5, Shang-Chi (2021-) #1 to #7The biggest challenge I’ve had with Shang-Chi is comparing the relaunched miniseries, and now ongoing 2021 Marvel series launch to previous works of incredible creator Gene Luen Yang. In 2020, Yang’s work on Dragon Hoops and Superman vs the Klan was literally my favorite in all of comics, and similar accolades can be thrown at the likes of Boxers and Saints or American Born Chinese. Yet, when Yang’s taken over superhero properties (for example Superman), the work has never wowed me in the same way.This holds for Shang-Chi, but honestly it may be an entirely unreasonable bar. Compared to the rest of Marvel – and literally the entire history of Shang-Chi comics in Masters of Kung-Fu – Yang’s reimagining of Shang-Chi’s place in the Marvel Universe is the most I’ve ever enjoyed the character. Yang, Ruan and the team craft an engaging Five Weapons Society, integrate compelling elements of Chinese history, and are doing some challenging work exploring how Shang-Chi presents himself to his family vs. the western Marvel Universe as we’ve come to know it. On top of all that, Yang and team are getting to have fun exploring all corners of the Marvel Universe, from Spider-Man to Wolverine to criminal auctions including the likes of MODOK and Madame Hydra.Creators: Leah Williams, David Baldeon, Israel Silva, Joe CaramagnaRelevant Issues: #6 to #10You know, for its first half, X-Factor felt like a delightful “hang out” comic, giving fans a unique opportunity to spend time with the diverse (and predominantly queer) gang of mutants investigating & confirming mutant deaths for Krakoan resurrections. As the series progressed into 2021, though, the creative unit brought storylines spanning the Mojoverse and the Morrigan full circle, into a frankly astonishing gambit of bringing everything full circle.Leah Williams is my favorite of the new wave of X-Men writers, and combined with the visuals of Baldeon and Silva – some of the best panel layout explorations in Marvel – X-Factor has been a consistent delight. That Marvel is ending the series with its 10th issue – despite satisfactory sales, huge fandom, AND literally the best queer representation in anything from the publisher – is frankly just confusing.Creators: Chip Zdarsky, Pasquel Ferry, Matt Hollingsworth, Phil NotoRelevant Issues: #1 to #5Chip Zdarsky is no stranger to putting Peter Parker through hell, as evidenced by the precurser limited series, Spider-Man: Life Story. Itself a variation on “What If,” Life Story played with the idea of Peter Parker actually aging through the decades – instead of operating on Marvel time – and the effect that a life like *that* would have on a character. Spider’s Shadow is back to Spidey stories grounded in the sliding timeline, set specifically after Peter Parker famously obtained the black symbiote costume in Secret Wars #8.Honestly, the series’ primary question – What if Peter never got rid of the symbiote? – isn’t really that interesting. We’ve seen Peter wrestle with that decision across a wide variety of story, from the original to animated series to feature films to the Ultimate Universe comics. What elevates Spider’s Shadow is how fully Zdarsky and Ferry lean into the premise and proceed to execute fully formed world building shaking up the pieces *around* Peter Parker. It’s a small change on paper, but the shifting of Marvel’s “What Ifs” from one-shots to miniseries really upgrades the potential, and it’s already showing.Creators: Donny Cates, Nic Klein, Matthew WilsonRelevant Issues: #9 to #15, Annual #1, #16 to #20Despite outstanding cosmic visuals from Klein and Wilson, the Donny Cates written era of Thor, following the years long tenure of Jason Aaron, got off to a sluggish start. The “Black Winter” felt a lot like Cates strip-mining his own recent Marvel greatest hits – a Knull-like cosmic figure as the villain, throwdowns with Galactus to establish scope and scale – without much that really spoke to the unique opportunity of Thor, King of Asgard.After the opener, though, Cates, Klein and team have really opened up with a run that feels like *their* Thor. “Prey” in particular is conceptually strong, but honestly even more than that, it’s deeply committed to using the long history and legacy of gods of thunder in energizing, exciting ways. I’m fully back in on this run, and look forward to where Cates, Klein and Wilson can take it from here.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: 2021, best ofs, Marvel ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "THE BEST DC COMICS OF 2016Dec 21, 2016I read a lot of comics this year. Some were good, some were bad. I’ve broken down everything I enjoyed into a couple of sections. These are the Top Five DC Comics series that came out in 2016 (in no order). Enjoy!Be sure to check out the other 2016 lists as well.THE OMEGA MENBetween The Vision, Sheriff of Babylon and The Omega Men, 2016 is the year of Tom King. White Lantern Kyle Rayner enters the Vega System in an attempt to broker peace with the warring planets, only to be captured by a terrorist cell known as the Omega Men. Or are they rebels attempting to overthrow the fascist rulers of the system who are responsible for genocide? In 12 issues, King manages to tackle issues of terrorism, fascism, religion, martyrdom, and morality without it ever feeling over-stuffed or under-developed. He forces Rayner and the reader to face a hard question: what are you willing to do for a better tomorrow ­– and can you live with yourself after doing it? This is one of the most complex comics to come out of DC over recent years. You’d be doing yourself a disservice to miss it.THE FLINTSTONES It’s 2016 and one of the best books DC Comics is putting out is The Flintstones. Crazy, right? The Flintstones was published alongside Scooby Doo and Wacky Races, two books that are also modern takes of older properties. Only difference is The Flinstones isn’t an obnoxiously try-hard “adult” reimagining (Wacky Races is a bizarre Mad Max riff, while Scooby Doo is set during the apocalypse). Mark Russell writes some really smart satire, using the prehistoric setting to take on modern day politics, consumerism and religion. That premise might sound trite, but Russell makes it work; he actually makes The Flintstones a relevant property in 2016. We now live in a world where Fred Flintstone is a character with depth, while Wilma and Pebbles are actual three-dimensional characters instead of “Hot Red-Headed Wife” and “Child.”SUPERMAN: AMERICAN ALIEN When writer Max Landis announced the American Alien, he described it as being “the anti-All Star Superman”, which is something I think it achieves. All Star is all about why Superman is so great, while American Alien wants to show us Kent’s journey to that greatness. Landis gets Superman, which is something a lot of writers struggle to do. He’s a character whose most interesting stories come from moral quandaries and exploring his humanity, and by showing Clark age issue to issue we get to see how his understanding of right and wrong mature. Each issue is drawn by a different artist, which helps to emphasis the mood of each stage of Clark’s life. Nick Dragotta’s bright-eyed, round faces populate Kent’s childhood, while Tommy Lee Edwards grungy style depicts a teenage Clark discovering that his powers can be both a gift and a curse, and Francis Manapul’s bright, water-coloured artwork in issue #6 shows Clark discovering himself as Superman. This is a solid reimaging of Superman’s origin.MIDNIGHTERSteve Orlando and ACO’s Midnighter was a late entry in DC’s New 52 line-up, but it is easily one of the best titles to come out as part of the brand. If you don’t know who Midnighter is, he was created as a parody of Batman, who’s gay and more Batman than Batman. He also has a computer in his brain that allows him to be ten-steps ahead. ACO (and a team of fill-in artists) drew some of the best fight scenes I’ve ever seen in a superhero book recently. Every moment flows perfectly, and you can feel the weight behind every blow. Orlando manages to balance the skull-crushing fights with genuine romance, which is great considering how few LGBQT characters appear in mainstream comics –­ let alone headlining a book. If you want to read a superhero comic running on all cylinders, you need to read this.DOOM PATROL Gerard Way’s previous series Umbrella Academy was one-big love letter homage to Grant Morrison’s Doom Patrol run, so having him write Doom Patrol is a no-brainer. Way, along with artist Nick Derington and colourist Tamra Bonvillian, have brought back a few classic DP members, like Robotman, Negative Man and Niles Caulder, and introduced new characters such as EMT driver Casey Brinkle and singing telegram Terry None. Together, they’re going up against an evil conglomerate that plans on commercialising Danny The Street, who is a sentient street. There’s also a micro-universe inside a gyro. I don’t fully understand where Way and Derington are going with Doom Patrol, but I can’t wait to find out. It’s a weird and imaginative comic­ — which is something DC has been lacking for awhile.ALL-STAR BATMANI really enjoyed Scott Snyder’s Batman run, although I think it lost some steam after issue #50. All-Star Batman might just be the Batman thing that Snyder has ever written — better than “Black Mirror,” even. John Romita Jr. is drawing some of the best art of his career here. It looks and feels like his early nineties Daredevil work. I find it hard to describe Batman comics as feeling “fresh” because he, more than any other character, always kind of languishes within the same plot beats. But All-Star doesn’t feel like a Batman story I’ve already read before, and I’m all for that. This first arc has Batman transporting Two-Face 500 miles from Gotham, while perused by literally every Batman villain.BATMAN (REBIRTH)The first arc of King’s Batman really didn’t do it for me. Compared to the rest of his output this year, it felt really lacklustre, like it was just another superhero book. I want to chalk most of that up to David Finch because I cannot stand his artwork. But this second arc has been fantastic and hitting the emotional complexities that I expect from King.SHADE, THE CHANGING GIRLOn planet Meta, alien-bird-thing Loma puts on the madness coat of Rac Shade and has her consciousness transported into the comatose body of Megan Boyer. It’s a high-school drama in which the lead character can physically manifest madness. After Doom Patrol, this is easily the second best book being put out under the Young Animals brand. Cecil Castellucci’s story is a bit of a slow burner, but like Doom Patrol you can tell that he’s building to something good. At the very least, you need to check it out for Marley Zarcone’s fantastic artwork. Her page layouts are incredible.WONDER WOMENThere were so many Wonder Woman comics that came out this year, and they were all great (Except Wonder Woman: Earth One, but I’ll get to that later). Jill Thompson’s The True Amazon is the best reimagining of Diana’s origin story. Renae De Liz’s The Legend of Wonder Woman would be a close second. Greg Rucka’s current Rebirth run is a solid return to the character, with Nicola Scott turning out some of the best art of her career (although they both need to get back on track with Black Magick).Pop culture writing that’s good for your health.

      "screenrant.comThe 10 Best Marvel Comic Books Ever, According To RankerMarvel has some of the best superheroes in comics, and these are the 10 best comic books by the publisher as voted on by the Ranker community.Standing at the top of the comic book mountain with the likes of DC, Marvel Comics has a wealth of popular characters in the superhero medium that spawned some of the publisher's best. The voting community at Ranker compiled a list of the best comic books/graphic novels of all time, and while DC takes the lion's share of the top of the list, Marvel features prominently, as well.RELATED: 10 Best DC Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerDaredevil works have featured toward the top, with the X-Men appearing frequently, as well. It makes sense, as those two properties are some of the most consistently well-written in the superhero genre.The X-Men have suffered greatly in their Marvel Comics history, and this first volume of the series relaunch started on the premise of Cyclops and Emma Frost reforming the team. However, their plans to do so become threatened by the prospect of a \"mutant cure\" being discovered by a scientist, which intrigues an extremely mutated Beat.This first arc was characterized by reintroducing core X-Men characters to set them up down the line and included the revival of Colossus. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 1: Gifted was praised for its story and being a good jumping-on point for a new age.One of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: Civil War, was loosely based on the Civil War comic crossover arc. Ironically enough, writer Mark Millar and artists Steve McNiven and Dexter Vines' comic book series received a polarizing reception during its 2006-2007 run.The story centered around the U.S. government passing the Superhero Registration Act that required superheroes to operate under official regulation akin to law enforcement. This pit Captain America's rebels against Iron Man's supporters, with the X-Men remaining neutral. However, over time, the meta-commentary explored in Civil War made the comic retroactively become well-received.Similar to DC's past imprints like Vertigo, Marvel has the MAX imprint that focuses on more mature content. One of the best to come out of that line was The Punisher MAX by Garth Ennis, Gregg Hurwitz, and Laurence Campbell. The first volume brings back a classic Punisher villain in the form of Microchip while pitting the titular antihero against two rival gangs in the middle of a bloody war.Its first arc, Kitchen Irish, was also a comic book influence for the acclaimed MCU Daredevil TV series on Netflix. The Punisher MAX took place within the mainline Marvel canon but told a smaller-scale, isolated story that didn't focus on crossing over with other major characters.The MCU's Infinity War and Endgame were loosely influenced by Jim Starlin's The Infinity Gauntlet limited series. Starlin created the villainous Thanos back in the early '70s, and over the years, the writer strung together multiple stories that ended up serving as a sprawling prelude to The Infinity Gauntlet.RELATED: 6 Comic Books To Read After Watching The Witcher Season 2Its plot centered on Thanos having gathered all the Infinity Gems, leading him to a quest to erase half of all life to impress Mistress Death. However, his granddaughter, Nebula, stole the gauntlet, prompting the Titan to team up with the surviving heroes to stop her. The six-issue limited series became one of the most well-received and influential comics of the '90s and spawned several sequels and spinoffs.Writer Chris Claremont teamed up with fellow industry veteran Frank Miller on pencils for one of Wolverine's best comic books. The duo was together in the first Wolverine series, which spanned a four-issue limited series. At this point, it chronicled Wolverine's adventures in Japan facing off against the yakuza and high-profile Daredevil villains, The Hand.Likewise, it also showed the X-Men superhero's engagement with romantic interest Mariko Yashida, who belonged to Japan's powerful Yashida crime family. This arc was an iconic one for the character, with it being the prime influence for 2013's The Wolverine movie directed by James Mangold with Hugh Jackman leading.1994's Marvels limited series was a celebration of the most acclaimed moments in Marvel Comics history. Writer Kurt Busiek and iconic artist Alex Ross had their careers launched thanks to their work on Marvels, which took a grounded and street-level approach to grandiose superhero storytelling.RELATED: 6 Video Games You Should Play After Watching Spider-Man - No Way HomeIt retold famous stories within the universe from the perspective of a news photographer named Phil Sheldon. Such landmark stories include the Fantastic Four defeating Galactus and Gwen Stacy's death at the hands of Green Goblin. This was the \"everyday life of a superhero\" theme that became famous and influenced their and other creators' work across the medium.Chris Claremont and John Byrne's Days of Future Past arc from The Uncanny X-Men series is one of Marvel's most acclaimed X-Men works. It was the inspiration for Fox's similarly titled 2014 movie, with the narrative focused on the X-Men going back in time to prevent a dystopian calamity that leads to peak anti-mutant aggression.This alternate dystopia saw mutants being rounded up and forced into internment camps, prompting the future version of Kitty Pryde to transfer herself into the present-day Pryde to help prevent this. The X-Men were always a strong allegory for civil rights and other social issues, and Days of Future Past is a lynchpin story in the superhero team's mythos.Though Fox failed twice at tastefully adapting it (The Last Stand and Dark Phoenix), The Dark Phoenix Saga comic book arc remains a classic. Veteran X-Men creative duo Claremont and Byrne put together this arc as well, written around Jean Grey becoming a supervillain in the form of Dark Phoenix.RELATED: 10 Best Marvel Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerShe manages to obtain a daunting level of power that maxes out her potential as a telepath, but it corrupts her as a result. The X-Men struggle to combat her and decide whether saving her is worth the disastrous cost of letting her run rampant for too long. Starting with the introduction of the Hellfire Club, The Dark Phoenix Saga spirals into an emotionally resonant story.Industry legend Frank Miller is known for his acclaimed work on Batman and Daredevil, but it was the latter where he got his start. And like he did for the Dark Knight in the '80s with Year One, Miller wrote Daredevil's definitive origin story in The Man Without Fear. This '90s comic book was part of Miller's reinvention of Daredevil that started in the early '80s into the gritty, crime-noir character that he's been celebrated as.The story shows Matt's underprivileged beginnings with his accident and death of his father, to being trained under Stick and beyond. It's a compelling, intimately-scaled story that also introduces key characters that would become pivotal later on, like Foggy, Kingpin, Typhoid Mary, and Elektra. The Man Without Fear also introduced the classic makeshift black suit that the Netflix series would use in seasons 1 and 3.Miller is responsible for many of Daredevil's best-ever comics, with Born Again and the aforementioned The Man Without Fear arguably his best work. The former centers around Karen Page selling Matt Murdock's identity out of desperation, which ultimately gets sold upward to the Kingpin of New York himself.What follows is an intense revenge story depicting Matt Murdock at one of the lowest points in his life, with Kingpin serving as the dark architect of his unraveling. Born Again is a gripping crime drama that culminates in one of the most triumphant and cathartic moments in Daredevil's career. Like with the origin-story comic, it was a major influence on Netflix's Daredevil. Specifically, it was the narrative anchor for the masterful third season.NEXT: 10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About Daredevil & Elektra's RomanceGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston.

Comics Of 2015January 13, 2017To repeat the caveat I gave on the main 2000’s page [which has links to see other years within the decade], the list you are about to see involves no judgment or pricing data, but rather simply ranks the universe of D.C. comics published in 2015 by how many copies have passed through CGC’s doors to date — that’s it!This exercise should tease out a very interesting list of “key” or otherwise interesting D.C. comics from 2015 but not necessarily an all-encompassing list (if very few copies were created for a given key, that restricted supply could keep the count of CGC submissions low).  So without further ado, here below is a list of the top 50 most-submitted D.C. comics from 2015 (census numbers are as of year-end 2016).

      "Ranking The Top 20 NBA Players 2021The 2020-2021 NBA regular season has concluded and has given us the opportunity to re-rank the top 20 NBA players. Some of the criteria we will be using are skills, performances, and impact on winning. For this list, I will try to rank them as if healthy, for the most part. Previous lists usually took availability more into consideration. That may be why you will find many different rankings from my previous top NBA players list from March.Devin Booker is one of the most gifted scorers in the NBA. He started the year as the third best shooting guard on my list, and is arguably second best. I’m of the belief that Booker still has a long way to go in his development. The addition of Paul has enabled Booker to be more efficient, which was much needed. I believe Booker has “dominant” type skillset, but has yet to really be able to show that in a winning situation. In summary, teams do not fear Booker the way they should just yet.Although I was not a fan of Beal’s attitude to start the year, he eventually bought into Westbrook’s leadership and the Wizards benefited as a result of it. Beal is one of the most capable scorers in the NBA. He could be higher on this list if he made his teammates better or played defense. The Wizards have a long way to go, and so does Beal.Per Sources followers may accuse me of being biased for ranking Tatum above Beal. However, I’ll make it very simple for you to understand. The playin tournament said it all for me. Tatum is improving as an offensive threat and has earned the respect of almost every NBA defender. His ability to score is right up there with the elites. Unlike Beal and Booker, I have seen Tatum do it in meaningful games, repeatedly. In addition to that, Jayson Tatum plays defense. Defense still matters folks.Some NBA fans rank Tatum as a top 10 player. I am not there yet.Yes, I have Simmons over Tatum, for now. Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate, and the star point guard of the no.1 ranked team in the Eastern Conference.  He makes his teammates better and does a lot at an elite level.Unfortunately, his inability to shoot is what’s keeping him from climbing on this list.As many of you already know, I am not a fan of Kyrie Irving. In fact, I have expressed numerous times why I and many others dislike Kyrie Irving. However, there is no denying Irving’s skillset and impact on winning, when playing alongside other stars. He is one of the best complimentary pieces to elite talent that you can find in the NBA.When available, Irving has proven he can help a team win when playing alongside two other all-stars. Irving is showing that once again.What more can Chris Paul do to prove to us that he is still an elite point guard in the NBA? Chris Paul is one of the best regular season players in NBA history. He makes any team he joins better. My only knock on Paul remains the fact that I have not seen him impact winning when his teams need him most. I don’t expect this year to be any different.For what he does, he does really well. He is still very impressive at 36 years of age.There are very few players that impact winning and make their teammates better the way Jimmy Butler does. The Heat were one of the best passing teams in the NBA this season, and would have finished with a better record had Butler not missed time. Butler is one of the toughest two way players in the NBA.I have my suspicions as to why the Heat struggled in the playoffs this year. Butler is not to blame for that, in my opinion.There are very few players who can actually impact the culture of an organization. The Wizards have almost become too content with missing the playoffs. They even started this season with wanting to give up at several points. Nonetheless, Westbrook never gave up.Westbrook was willing to do it all to lift the Wizards to the 8th seed. By any means necessary, the Wizards made it, despite having a mediocre and relatively injured roster. Westbrook is truly one of the most underappreciated superstars in NBA history.George remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. Say what you want about his lack of playoff success, there is no denying George’s talent and physical gifts. My only issue with George is his mental toughness. He reminds me a lot of Vince Carter.In my heart, I still believe that Leonard is the second best player in the NBA. I just couldn’t rank him in my top 10 NBA players at this point. All the things I respected about Leonard haven’t been present ever since he joined the Clippers. In the past, I watched LeBron James shut down the Bulls’ offense when guarding Derrick Rose in the playoffs. Last night, Leonard failed to instill any fear in the heart of Doncic and the Mavericks.Something has changed for the worse, and I can’t pin point what it is exactly. Leonard is still the closest thing I have seen to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, but I need some reconvincing right now.What Anthony Davis can do, when healthy, is almost unmatched. He remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. I know I mentioned in the opening paragraph that I would weigh availability a little less than I usually do, but I just can’t do that with Davis. He may be the reason the Lakers are about to be eliminated tonight. Davis needs to figure out a way to be available. Despite his health issues, I couldn’t leave a talent like Davis off the top 10 of my top 20 NBA players in 2021.I’m of the belief that Lillard is asked to do too much, which causes him to burn out come playoff time. That is why I lack faith in Lillard and the Trail Blazers come playoff time. However, there is no denying that Lillard is a superstar talent. Not only is he an elite scoring point guard, he is arguably the most clutch player in the NBA. When I think of Lillard, I don’t think of dominant like Leonard. However, the continuity he has with Terry Stotts has enabled Lillard to perform at a very high level in the regular season. The guys ahead of Lillard on my top 20 NBA players 2021 list, I consider dominant.Joel Embiid is right up there with Anthony Davis as one of the best two way big men in the NBA. Embiid’s dominance enabled him to be an MVP favorite for a large chunk of the season. However, like Davis, injuries have plagued him throughout his career. If the 76ers are going to win an NBA championship this season, they’re going to need a healthy Embiid to be at his best.Embiid has the talent to do it. The question is, is he built to last?MVP.Ranking Doncic ahead of Jokic on my top 10 NBA players list was a very difficult decision for me. They both make their teams better, dominate at a high level, and have incredibly high basketball IQs. Jokic is a slightly better defender.  However, it is very easy to argue that Doncic is doing a lot more, with a lot less talent. Doncic used the early portion of the regular season to get himself in shape, which cost the Mavericks in the rankings. Now that he is in shape, he is almost impossible to stop. I watched Doncic single handedly torch the Los Angeles Clippers last night.Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tim Dunca, LeBron James, and now Luka Doncic. I consider this kid a once in a generation type talent. I haven’t been wrong about Doncic yet. If I’m wrong right now, it may be the fact that I’m not ranking him as the best player in the world yet.For a decent amount of this season, Harden was playing like the best player in basketball. Now that he is healthy again, he is looking like the best player in the world once again. Sometimes opportunity can shape up a large part of your success. Harden may be a beneficiary of his current opportunity with the loaded Brooklyn Nets.Harden also happens to be the most lethal isolation offensive threat I’ve ever seen in my life. Whether it’s the step back three, attacking the rim, or passing, Harden can do it all. I just wonder what he and the Nets will look like playing against another top tier eastern conference team. There is no denying the 2x MVP & DPOY’s talent. Perhaps no player impacts both sides of the court like Antetokounmpo does. I also love the fact that he is continuing to improve, year after year. Antetokounmpo’s poise may help the Bucks win in this post season. Fans may argue his limitations as a shooter. I believe this series vs the Brooklyn Nets will be a massive indicator as to just how much does shooting matter to a star in the NBA.LeBron James publicly considered Curry as the MVP for good reason. Curry proved once again that he can torch any team, on any given night. He is the best shooter in NBA history. His handles are on par with Irving and his passing is on par with Nash. He is one of the most gifted point guards in NBA history, currently ranked 2nd all time on my list.If Klay was healthy, the Warriors would be my favorites to win the NBA championship this season. Ranking Durant this highly is complicated and slightly contradictory. If I was building a team for the regular season, I can argue that there are 20+ players I’d take over Kevin Durant. If it weren’t for a mid season trade, I don’t know if Brooklyn would have even made the playoffs this season due to his and Irving’s absences. However, I’m looking at Durant as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Durant is one of the most gifted, if not the most gifted, scorer in NBA history. There is no proven method of guarding Durant. I don’t know if there is a proven way of even slowing him down. When available, good luck finding a scorer better than Durant. As of right now, he is available, and dominant.LeBron James is still the king in my eyes. He makes his teammates better in ways no one else can in the NBA. I don’t think people realize how bad the Lakers roster actually is. They have taken a significant step back from last season’s team, and I didn’t even think that roster was that good.At 36, the king remains dominant. However, for the first time in Per Sources history, I feel like the end of James’ dominance is near. It’s shaky. I can sense it.  I hope when the time comes, I’m ready to admit it.I have to mention Klay Thompson, who is out due to injury. Two players I feel the need to mention are Rudy Gobert and Trae Young. Both have impact on winning that I do not feel like NBA fans appreciate. I’d also like to recognize the improving talents of DeAndre Ayton, Ja Morant, and Zion Williamson.Jaylen Brown and Julius Randle are also two players that could make this list next season.

      "Top 100 NBA players for 2021-22 seasonJoel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Sixers, top 100 NBA players (Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)We are less than two weeks from the beginning of training camp. NBA basketball is on the horizon, and with it comes the return of the greatest basketball players in the world.Before last season, we ranked the top 50 NBA players. It’s safe to say a lot has changed since then. This time around, we are expanding the list to 100 in an effort to show more love to more excellent players.For comparison’s sake, here are the top 10 players from last preseason:Given the relative uncertainty around rookies, we did not put rookies on the list. Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and the like will probably join the top 100 soon enough, but we haven’t seen them in NBA action yet.Here are the top 100 NBA players entering the 2021-22 season.Andrew Wiggins made the best of his new situation in Golden State, becoming a genuinely impressive wing defender and a useful complementary scorer. He’s still prone to some brutal decision-making on offense, but if he can keep hitting 38.0 percent of his 3s, Golden State will be more than happy.The Warriors will be right back in contention next season if Klay Thompson is healthy. Golden State has loaded up on a couple strong free agents, and with Kelly Oubre presumably out of the way, Wiggins should have more room to play to his strengths as a downhill driver and cutter.Larry Nance Jr. is best known for his dunks, but he’s more than a vertical spectacle. He’s one of the best defensive forwards in the NBA, supplying elite versatility to any rotation. His quick hands, dynamic athleticism, and advanced instincts allow him to guard multiple positions, and he’s a force off the ball, where he racks up deflections.On offense, Nance has rounded into form as a strong complementary talent. He processes the game at a high level, and generally knows where and when he should be. He doesn’t domineer possessions, but instead thrives as a rim runner and occasional spot-up shooter, with the passing chops necessary to connect all the dots.The Pelicans will benefit from Devonte’ Graham’s arrival, even if it stems from unfortunate asset mismanagement. He’s a pretty perfect fit next to Zion Williamson — a high-I.Q. playmaker and one of the NBA’s most prolific spot-up shooters. He can play off the ball, or keep the offense zipping when he’s at the controls.Graham struggled at times last season, but he was also buried in a deep Charlotte backcourt. For better or worse, the Pelicans will put his talent on full display. He’s essentially the No. 3 option behind Williamson and Brandon Ingram at this point.Steven Adams is universally accepted as the strongest player in the NBA. That has its inherent benefits. He’s possibly the best offensive rebounder in the game, not to mention a pretty darn great defensive rebounder. He can also impose his will defensively in certain matchups, especially when harassing the league’s more post-bound centers.A rough year in New Orleans has dulled the excitement around Adams as a player, but he’s still quite useful, and should find a more amiable home in Memphis. He can feast on dump-offs from Ja Morant and bring his physicality to the city of Grit n’ Grind.Kelly Olynyk experienced a renaissance of sorts in Houston, seeing his workload expanded tenfold for a losing team short on NBA talent. While Olynyk’s numbers in Houston probably overstate his value — 19.0 points, 8.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, .542/.392/.844 — he is no doubt a very useful, versatile offensive weapon.We should see Olynyk produce fruitfully in Detroit, even if he will now take a backseat to Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant. He brings immense value as a floor-spacer at center, with the quickness and face-up ability to torch slower bigs on the perimeter. He’s also a physical, smart team defender, if not a great rim protector.Build your custom FanSided Daily email newsletter with news and analysis on Philadelphia 76ers and all your favorite sports teams, TV shows, and more.Your favorite teams, topics, and players all on your favorite mobile devices.© 2022 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

      " TOP 10 BEST MARVEL COMICS OF 2016 ComicsBecause I gotten many kind words for my top 10 list for best DC Comics, I'm going follow through on my plans and make another list, this time on the Marvel side!This is my list of the comics I believe are worth checking out. Will some have negatives? Possibly but I believe it's the positives that can outshine it all! So let's get started:10. INFAMOUS IRON MANOriginally this spot went to Jessica Jones but after reading it's third issue, I have to say Infamous Iron Man did so much more in only three issues compared to Jessica Jones!This has to be one of Bendis' best books yet! It changes the status quo of an iconic character while still keeping true to who he is. Who would ever think Doctor Doom can be an awesome superhero? It's a got this dark and gritty art that sort of works with a Doctor Doom story, with all these twists and turns, I definitely see so much potential in this book! I recommend it!HONORABLE MENTION: JESSICA JONESAlso written by Bendis with art by Michael Gaydos (the original team, heck even original cover artist David Mack is back! Now that's consistency.) Jessica Jones returns after ten years without a book of her own and she's the booze-drinking, kick ass PI we all know and loved in the Netflix series!I loved this series, if you asked my two years ago, I would say I've never been fond of Jessica Jones but after Netflix and my hard research I realized  she's one of my favorite Marvel characters that I'm glad is getting involved again. Her book really continues stories that ended or began in Civil War II, and possibly Secret Wars! This is a fantastic book you need to check out!9. DEAD NO MORE: THE CLONE CONSPIRACYDan Slott and Christos Cage might've made the BEST clone story for Spider-Man, I've ever read! With help from artists such as Giuseppe Camuncoli, Dead No More, really brings out new twists, new villainous motivations, new villains in generals, and the dead returning but at a cost that has Spider-Man racing against time to stop the Jackal!Dead No More really sets the bar for a good clone story, because they're not entirely clones. It brings this question to Peter Parker and has him decide: if you could bring back someone, would you take that chance? I love how NOW Peter has to decide what to do, as he faces villains he's faced as well as people he's loved and loss now turned against him for the sake of survival. We got guest characters in Spider-Gwen, Prowler (getting his own book in the process), and the returning Scarlet Spider...can you guess which one I'm talking about :wink: ? Overall, a great event you need to check out!8. CIVIL WAR IIProtect the future or Change it? Brian Michael Bendis and David Marquez really dig into the philosophy of heroes having to choose a side that questions their morals. A young inhuman named Ulysses has the power to foresee a possible future and this has the Marvel Universe at each other throats! It's Captain Marvel (change) vs Iron Man (protect)! Young heroes become disillusioned with their mentors and idols, lines are crossed and the world will never be the same!Now I know what people are thinking, \"why is this on your list? I mean the poor characterizations, killing off beloved characters because why not? Ignoring tie-ins (Totally Awesome Hulk), Captain Marvel gets no love here! So why?\" Well aside from the fantastic art of David Marquez, the book succeeds in doing what it set out to do: it got people talking. We didn't stop talking about the deaths of War Machine, Bruce Banner, poor Jen and Miles, and soon Tony! Another is that compared to the first Civil War, this was more personal between certain characters only and focused on their thoughts something I have to commend. A problem I have, is  not the book but the delays almost hurting this book with series that take place after the massive event, spoiled the ending (Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Infamous Iron Man, & Invincible Iron Man, etc...) if he had no control over it, poor Bendis...despite the spoilers it did fantastic in it's mission, and it changed the marvel universe forever...divided we stand!7. CAPTAIN AMERICA: STEVE ROGERSHail Hydra! Words we'd never thought we hear from this patriotic hero and that it did! Nick Spencer also got attention for this book because of that first issue and maybe I'm in the minority, HydraCap might be some cash grab, but it's a good story that's entertaining me! Steve Rogers was restored to his youth thanks to Kobik, but this was the Red Skull's plan to rewrite his reality as an undercover Hydra Agent!With great art and good writing, Captain America: Steve Roger tells the story of Marvel Universe's biggest threat and they don't even know it! I think they don't have much to tell a story with Steve Rogers as Sam Wilson is handling the modern day issues of politics and all things PC, (not that SR isn't handling politics as well but it's probably overshadowed by HydraCap) this story really changes the way we know Steve and I can't wait for everyone to find out who he is! Hail Hydra indeed....6. AMAZING SPIDER-MAN: RENEW YOUR VOWSGerry Conway is back writing Spider-Man if \"One More Day\" didn't happened and boy, only two issues in is it something to behold! Taking place in the Secret Wars domain now a Universe of its own, Peter Parker marries Mary Jane Watson and have child of their own Annie who developed her own spider powers. After the battle with Regent, they now face new threats, for the adults? It's parenthood!Ok sure it sort of felt like Superman: Lois & Clark but it's benefit that it doesn't take place with them stranded in another universe but in their own world, facing new creative threats. It's such a great spider-book. This is another, maybe better way of showing Peter maturing and growing up comparing to Amazing Spider-Man which shows another way but for some it didn't feel right. This however, does.5. CHAMPIONS#Champions! Written by ANAD Avengers writer Mark Waid with art done by Humberto Ramos, continues the story of the young heroes following Civil War II. They're the young generation that feels the old one is no longer doing any good and it's time for them to take a stand. Members Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Nova, Viv Vision, Cyclops and the Totally Awesome Hulk become a force for good as they fight all new threatsWhat I love about Champions is that it isn't a super hero team, it's more than that. It's movement, a movement against prejudice, discrimination, and modern problems in the forms of villains or real life problems all over the world. It's truly something to behold. Sure Hulk seems out of character but everything else is just right! If you want a book with a strong message than this is for you!4. VisionTom King wrote a true masterpiece here as he ventured to Marvel for a while and wrote a true classic that will stand to the tests of time! Vision is about her titular synthezoid as he creates a family of his own to better understand humanity. Only him, his wife, and children are in for a much darker story.I never thought I'd feel for a book like Vision. The suspense, the chills, the feels, it had a heartwarming ending after such dark turns for certain characters. I really recommend this book if you're a Tom King fan, it's truly going to be a Marvel classic.3. ULTIMATESUltimates was always one of my top favorite comics of the All-New, All-Different Marvel comics. With beautiful art from Kenneth Rocafort, great guest appearance from Giant Man and didn't let Civil War II tie-ins hinder the book of its greatness, it's truly THE Avengers book.Al Ewing may not be Jonathan Hickman but he's possibly the next best thing! He knows which characters to choose from, like America Chavez, who got a big push since then! They were the ultimate team to solve the ultimate problems. One of them was Galactus who they changed his status quo from Devourer of Worlds to Lifebringer! I mean who does that?! Ewing, that's who! Rocafort's art is just gorgeous with it's visually stunning background and detail. Although Rocafort is no longer on the book and we got Travel Foreman (who's not as stellar but has his moments) Ultimates (2) isn't so bad, because the story is still the same good old awesomeness that Ewing brings. Truly the \"ULTIMATE\" book to check out!  2. MOON KNIGHTI was debating whether or Vision was going to be #2, but I'm not going to speak for the majority because for me #2 goes to Moon Knight for getting me into the character! It didn't take long for me to get sucked into Jeff Lemire's truly and gritty take on the character who is currently stuck in an asylum which may not be all that it seems. It's a fight against god's, and his own mind as Moon Knight has me sold!The transition of the many artists for Marc Spector's personalities is creative and feels as if they were different books entirely! The main artist is way better however as he has this dark, gritty and toned down look for the series that I just love. This really makes me want that Netflix series already! So pick this up, you might be entertained as much as I was!And my number one favorite Marvel book of 2016 is....1. INVINCIBLE IRON MANYea, only two issues in and this series has proven it's much a different take on Iron Man and I love it. After Iron Man's tragic death in Civil War II, Riri Williams takes the mantle as Ironheart and lives up a legacy and embraces her genius! But Tony isn't dead as per say, and becomes a helpful ally for the new hero.Dealing with Chicago violence, and problems of a teenager, Invincible Iron Man was such a wild concept that caused controversy and at the same time, support from others. I was looking for a story rather than listen to the supposed controversy surrounding it. And I got such a damn good book so far! It allows us to see who Riri is. Like Captain America: Steve Rogers, there's only so much you can do with Tony Stark, having been around for decades, I think this is the best thing for Iron Man. If you want a different take on Iron Man, with stellar art and fantastic writing, then please, check out my #1 favorite Marvel comic of 2016! Who knows, if it keeps going, it'll be my favorite comic of 2017!And Now for My Most Anticipated Comic (it's Tomorrow! Or today, depending when I'm posting this)HULKIts coming out tomorrow! I'm so excited to see a new take on She-Hulk! This might be the actual \"Hulk\" of the Marvel Universe, someone struggling with trauma, anger and their demons. Except unlike Banner, Jen was always able to control it, what happens when she can't anymore? I'm excited to read this!So those are my top 10 favorite Marvel Comics of this year! I loved reading these comics! I know there are others like Infamous Iron Man, Sam Wilson, or Avengers, but these are my top 10! Stay tuned because I got three more End of the Year posts plus my usual reviews. So have a great Tuesday! What are your favorite Marvel comics of this year?__________________________________[#Society][#Pantheons][#DefendersOfAmino][#DOAAllStar]Made an alteration to #10, a recent issue really made me see something better!Great list thanks for sharing the good marvel stories, Although the list is longer then This.

      "Top 100 NBA Players of 2021Who will be the NBA’s best players in the 2020–21 season? Sports Illustrated‘s Top 100 list returns, aiming to answer that question.As always, this is a wide-ranging exercise with a host of qualified candidates. There’s an abundance of information and analytical resources available with which to assess players. The rankings were again determined holistically by a combination of data and subjective evaluation, aiming to take players out of their team contexts and look at their skills and performance in a vacuum. These rankings are specifically for the upcoming season, and they do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2020–21.It’s best to look at these rankings as short-term projections, based on performance history and the impact of a player's age—some growth can be expected from younger players, and a degree of potential decline from older veterans. This is not a representation of a player’s trade or market value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact—on offense, on defense, structural and otherwise—and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill sets.Availability due to injury and future injury risk has always factored into this process—this year, the two resulting omissions were Klay Thompson and Jonathan Isaac. Stars like Kevin Durant and John Wall are making their returns from serious setbacks. Others, like Kemba Walker and Kristaps Porzingis, are already banged up to start the season. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year’s list, click here. We also compiled a watch list of 12 young players who could make the top 100 for years to come. This is the first Top 100 list without Rob Mahoney, who along with Ben Golliver set the standard for this process over the better part of the past decade. Rob’s 2020 list provided a particularly valuable starting point. SI NBA writers Rohan Nadkarni, Michael Shapiro and Ben Pickman provided valuable feedback and contributed to the player entries.For further reference, explore SI.com’s Top 100 Players of 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. This year's list incorporated data and statistical context from Basketball-Reference, NBA.com, ESPN.com and Synergy Sports.Let the debates begin! Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports; Kevin Jairaj/USA TODAY Sports; Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports; Greg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports; Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports; Kelvin Kuo/USA TODAY Sports100. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursThe Spurs are in the midst of pivoting to a new era, with DeMar DeRozan’s and LaMarcus Aldridge’s contracts set to expire after 2020–21. So who will lead San Antonio forward? Murray is likely the franchise headliner. He isn’t a prototypical point guard, but Murray’s athletic gifts are undeniable. He’s a superb on-ball defender, sporting a 6' 10\" wingspan that makes life increasingly difficult for opposing guards. Murray’s ability to upsize onto larger guards provides significant value, as does his ability to wreak havoc in passing lanes. There’s a significant dose of uncertainty for San Antonio after two decades of sustained success. Murray’s defensive excellence should help stabilize the ship. His defensive value and transition prowess lands him the final spot on our Top 100, and he’ll need to improve his half-court offense to move much higher. Murray attempted fewer than two threes per game last season, and his reticence from beyond the arc isn’t an isolated statistic. He doesn’t quite explode to the rim in the half court, nor does he look to create his own shot. He’s often too content to probe and dish, limiting his scoring impact in a middling offense. Let’s hope Murray truly takes the reins of San Antonio’s offense after an underwhelming offensive campaign in 2019–20. —Michael ShapiroGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated99. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatHow important is Robinson to the Heat’s offense? When he, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo shared the floor last season, Miami had an offensive rating of 115.8, practically equivalent to the all-time mark of 115.9 set by the Mavericks in 2020. Without Robinson, lineups including Butler and Adebayo could manage an offensive rating of only 108.8, which would have ranked in the bottom third of the league. Simply put, Robinson’s presence is the difference between a historic offense and a middling one. And it’s all because of the pressure he puts on defenses with his otherworldly shooting. If his breakout year doesn’t prove to be a massive fluke, Robinson will be one of the best floor spacers in NBA history. He shot 46.0% on catch-and-shoot looks in the 2019–20 season. That means his effective field goal percentage on such shots is 69%, which is higher than what LeBron James shoots on attempts within five feet. Only 26 years old, Robinson should have time to grow the other areas of his game. His defense improved throughout the playoffs, though he’ll still be targeted on that end. And his offensive game could use an extra flourish here and there, or at least one counter to teams who can doggedly chase him off the arc (as the Lakers did in the Finals.) As Robinson rounds out his game, he will continue to [ahem] shoot up this list. —Rohan Nadkarni98. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsOne of the most impressive parts of the Nuggets’ most recent Western Conference finals run was that they won two thrilling playoff series without Barton. The 29-year-old small forward started 58 games for the Nuggets last season and was among the team’s most consistent contributors. He averaged 15.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.5% from three and playing a multitude of roles. Simply put, he was Denver’s third-most-reliable player. Barton left the bubble on Aug. 19 with a knee injury, after playing just a single half of an Orlando scrimmage. But heading into this season, those within the Nuggets organization continue to echo his importance. “We’re not where we are without Will,” new GM Calvin Booth recently said. Barton, a former second-round pick of the Trail Blazers, was traded to Denver in the middle of the 2014–15 season as part of a deal that sent shooting guard Aaron Afflalo to Portland. And while Barton was once viewed as merely a solid wing defender off the bench, he has gone on to start 155 games for Denver, almost all of which have come in the last three seasons. It’s possible that Michael Porter Jr. might cut into Barton’s role this season, but the veteran small forward will surely be a key part of another Nuggets team with title aspirations. —Ben Pickman97. Jonas Valančiūnas, Memphis GrizzliesValančiūnas isn’t earning All-NBA honors anytime soon, but Memphis’s big man remains a legitimate problem for defenses on the low block. Valančiūnas posted a 60.6 effective field goal percentage in 2019–20, averaging 0.97 points per possession on post-up attempts. The Lithuanian big man made his mark in the NBA as a skilled offensive big, though he often lacked the physicality expected from a player his size during his seven seasons in Toronto. The move to Memphis has brought out the best in Valančiūnas. He snagged a career-high 11.3 rebounds per game last season, providing a dose of brute strength next to talented youngsters Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke. Valančiūnas remains a key cog for the Grizzlies as they look to snap a three-year playoff drought. —M.S.96. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles Clippers Three-and-D doesn’t do Patrick Beverley justice because it doesn’t account for the fact he’s a Hall of Fame pest. Beverley is one of the most relentless on-ball defenders in the NBA, and he relishes his role as someone who exists to annoy superstars and anger opposing fanbases. (He can also delight people—I distinctly remember Bill Hader got quite a kick at a Clippers game last season watching Beverley harass James Harden.) On the other end of the floor, Beverley is a career 38.1% three-point shooter, which means he’s the kind of player who can stay on the court in the highest-stakes moments. While Beverley’s on-ball tenacity, sneaky-good offensive rebounding, and capable shooting would be welcomed by any contender, his game also exists in a narrow scope. His size (perhaps generously listed at 6’1”) means he won’t be regularly used on perimeter stars. And he’s not a playmaker nor a pick-and-roll option, though he nominally functions as a point guard. These limitations hardly make Beverley a liability. But without the proper infrastructure around him (like playing with superstars), his talents wouldn’t be as pronounced. —R.N.95. Harrison Barnes, Sacramento KingsHarrison Barnes always felt a bit like the fifth Beatle in his time with the Warriors, and perhaps that’s led to an underwhelming evaluation of his skill set entering 2020–21. He’s viewed by many as little more than a replacement-level wing, but a closer look provides a clearer picture. Barnes may not be a standout player in any single metric. But his wide array of skills makes him a valuable player and an underrated asset. Barnes has seen his scoring drop in each of the past two seasons, but a dip in volume has correlated with perhaps the most efficient stretch of his career. Barnes posted his second best career true shooting percentage in 2019–20, and he’s one of 20 players to make more than 275 threes at a clip of over 38% in the last two seasons. Barnes isn’t solely a stationary shooter. He can attack the rim and finish with authority, and he’s evolved into a somewhat savvy playmaker. His contract may dampen his value on the trade market, but Barnes remains an effective player nearly a decade into his career. — M.S.94. Otto Porter Jr., Chicago BullsPorter doesn’t exactly provide the most bang for your buck out of any player in our Top 100. He’s logged just 52 games in the last two seasons, and he’s on the books for $28 million in 2020–21. But despite an underwhelming tenure in Chicago thus far, Porter remains an intriguing piece for this season and beyond. If the Bulls find their way in the playoff chase this spring, Porter could play a crucial role. When healthy, he’s shown flashes as an elite three-and-D guy, sporting an impressive three-point stroke for a player of his size. Porter is one of just five players to shoot over 42% from three in the last four seasons (min. 400 makes), and he sports the size to defend larger forwards and the occasional big man. His fit in Chicago specifically is a bit curious. The Bulls are flush with forwards after drafting Patrick Williams, and there isn’t a deep collection of playmakers on the roster. Porter is a quality stationary wing, but he provides little off the bounce. Perhaps he can make an impact on a contender via a trade before the deadline. —M.S.93. Dāvis Bertāns, Washington WizardsBertāns’s nickname, the Latvian Laser, should move him up at least a few spots on our list, but that’s an argument for another day. What’s not up for debate is Bertāns’s value as one of the league’s most effective frontcourt shooters. The fifth-year forward continues to show impressive range from beyond the arc, making a legitimate leap in 2019–20 as he nearly doubled his scoring to 15.4 points per game. Bertāns has some skill as a roll man and interior defender, but those attributes are quite ancillary to his ability to let it fly from beyond the arc. Only seven players canned more threes last season. Of the 93 players to hit 100 triples, just four posted a better percentage from three. Bertāns can stretch the floor far beyond the arc, and he has one of the quicker releases in the NBA. Washington remains on the fringe of the playoff race entering 2020–21, but they could sport one of the league’s most exciting offenses. Bertāns’s excellence remains integral to the Wizards’ attack. —M.S.92. Derrick Favors, Utah JazzSimply knowing where to be at all times and never flinching is a skill unto itself. And after a year away in New Orleans, Favors returns to Utah as the league’s most overqualified backup center. Despite missing time with an injury, he finished just outside the top-10 in rebound percentage and lent defensive backbone to a team that struggled massively without him. While his mobility has waned to a degree, Favors has proven he can take away easy looks at the rim and is hardly ever out of position. He also shot a career-high 61.7% from the field, remaining among the league’s more effective finishers, capable of overpowering a mismatch when necessary. He’s also an underrated passer in the short-roll, capable of delivering the ball to either corner and greasing an offense in a pinch. Favors knows his strengths and requires minimal maintenance. It’s tough to place a premium on most bigs who present no threat to shoot from distance, and his lack of a jump shot limits his utility as such—the Jazz ought to make his minutes mutually exclusive with Rudy Gobert’s as much as possible. Situationally, there’s only so much value that can be ascribed. But Favors’s presence has long ensured a degree of reliable defensive competence, and his skills continue to age gracefully. And in a reserve role, his services are quite a luxury. —Jeremy Woo91. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersOn June 20, 2019, the Suns traded Warren and the No. 32 pick in the 2019 draft to the Pacers for cash considerations. Just over a year later, Warren, who was in effect traded for cap space, emerged as one of the biggest stars of the bubble. He scored 53 points in Indiana’s opening seeding-game victory over the Sixers and followed that performance up with 34- and 32-point games over Washington and Orlando, respectively. Warren has always been a prolific scorer. He averaged 25 points per game as a sophomore at NC State, his final collegiate season, and reached double digits in his second NBA season. In each of his final two seasons with the Suns, he averaged more than 18 points per game. With Indiana last year, he recorded career-high 19.8 points per game while improving his field goal percentage from 48.6% to 53.6%. While the 6’ 8’’ Warren is by no means a lockdown defender on the wing, he also showed improvement on that end of the floor. The Pacers preached continuity this offseason and have returned the core of their roster, meaning that Warren will yet again be a key scorer for an Eastern Conference playoff hopeful. —B.P.Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports90. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersAt 34 years old, Williams remains one of the most professional scorers in the league. He averaged 18.2 points per game for the Clips in 2020, playing 28.7 minutes a night off the bench. Williams can get hot at a moment’s notice, and many a coach has watched their lead slip away because of a Lou scoring barrage. With the right pick-and-roll partner, Williams can be particularly devastating, penalizing defenses who aren’t fully confident in their coverages. Efficiency is a bit of a bugaboo here, however. Williams ranked in the top five pick-and-roll ballhandlers in terms of frequency last season, but he generated only 0.92 points per possession on those plays. That number is not terrible and certainly above average, but it’s a reminder there are sometimes better looks to be had when Williams commands the offense while some of his more illustrious teammates are on the floor. Also, his size makes him an easy target on defense. All of that being said, if you are in desperate need of a bucket, you could do a lot worse than Williams. —R.N89. Serge Ibaka, Los Angeles ClippersNow entering his 12th NBA season, Ibaka remains one of the most versatile bigs in the league. After being used primarily as a power forward throughout the first decade of his career, including his first season in Toronto, the 31-year-old Ibaka played the majority of his minutes last year as the Raptors’ center. In doing so, he provided Toronto with a capable floor-spacer from the perimeter, shooting 38.5% from three, his best mark since 2016–17. While Ibaka might not be as much of a rim protector as he was when he was a spry 22-year-old blocking more than 3.5 shots per game, he remains a smart and more-than-capable force on the defensive end of the floor. His two-year deal with the Clippers was widely regarded as one of the most economical yet potentially impactful deals of the offseason. According to Basketball Reference, Ibaka had the highest postseason win-share of his career per 48 minutes in last year’s postseason, after averaging a postseason career-high 14.8 points per game. In joining L.A., he will similarly be expected to play a key role for a team with title aspirations, and he will bring Los Angeles much-needed frontcourt flexibility. —B.P88. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn NetsDinwiddie has shown steady growth in each of first four years in Brooklyn, emerging as the Nets’ leading man in 2019–20 after Kyrie Irving’s season ended in February. Squint hard enough and Dinwiddie at times resembles Irving, though with considerably fewer acrobatics around the rim. Regardless, Dinwiddie is effective as the pick-and-roll initiator, excelling when he can drive downhill at opposing bigs. He remains outside any All-Star conversation, but Dinwiddie can be a passable engine for an NBA offense. It could be a bit of an awkward transition for Dinwiddie in 2020–21 with Irving and Kevin Durant now leading the Nets. Dinwiddie posted a career-high in usage last season, and in the games he did play with Irving, there was a palpable tug-of-war within Brooklyn’s system. But if Dinwiddie buys into his role, he could be an effective piece in a high-octane attack. Dinwiddie made 37.3% of catch-and-shoot threes last season, and he could spend a hefty share of minutes alongside Durant when Irving heads to the bench. Dinwiddie could also be in for a sizable new contract next summer if he continues his progression. —M.S.87. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsIt’s undeniable that Millsap’s best NBA days are behind him, but the 35-year-old power forward still remains an important part of Denver’s roster heading into the 2020–21 NBA season. When Millsap joined the Nuggets in 2017 on a three-year, $90 million deal, he helped shepherd a young franchise into the future, culminating, thus far, in Denver’s most recent Western Conference finals run. Despite his scoring output dropping to its lowest mark since 2009–10 and his rebounding total dropping to its lowest mark since 2007–08, Millsap remains a steady defender who is capable of playing a productive, limited role on a high-quality team. The four-time All-Star recorded double-digit points four times in Denver’s thrilling Western Conference semifinals series victory over the Clippers, including tallying 17 points in Denver’s series-altering Game 5 win. He returns to Denver this season on a one-year deal, looking to help the Nuggets reach their first Finals appearance since they joined the NBA in the mid 1970s. —B.P.86. Joe Harris, Brooklyn NetsBrooklyn Nets team president Sean Marks recently said that small forward Joe Harris “epitomized what it means to be a Net.” The 29-year-old Harris fully resurrected his career in Brooklyn after playing just 56 games in his first two years in Cleveland. He enters this season as a starter on a perennial playoff team, having signed a fresh four-year deal worth more than $70 million. Among the 208 players who have taken at least 400 three-pointers since 2017–18, only Seth Curry has a higher three-point field goal percentage than Harris. While his three-point percentage dropped to 42.4% last season—a decrease from his league-leading 47.4% mark in 2018–2019—Harris still finished the year tied for sixth in three-point percentage. On a team that is littered with stars, Harris also appears to be more than content staying out of the public spotlight (as evidenced by being one of the few NBA players not on Twitter). After inking his new deal, the former second-round pick told reporters that he “couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.” He’ll be a key cog in the Nets’ present and future, and as the modern NBA continues to emphasize the importance of consistent three-point shooters, Harris’s value should only increase. —B.P.85. Marc Gasol, Los Angeles LakersAt 35, Gasol is no longer the same player he was back in the early to mid-2010s, when he anchored a Grizzlies team that was a perennial postseason threat. He still remains a valuable piece on any team he joins. While Gasol averaged 19.5 points per game in the 2016–17 season, that number dropped to a career-low 7.5 points per game last year, in his first full season with the Raptors. The Spanish center’s post-up game has diminished, but he has been more open to taking three-pointers in recent years, shooting 38.5% for Toronto in 2019–20. The former Defensive Player of the Year remains a force on that end of the court, using his high IQ and strong instincts to make an impact. As an example, he was part of all four of Toronto’s best defensive lineups that logged at least 50 minutes. “I use a lot of communication as a center,” Gasol said recently. “You’re behind them. I think communication builds trust and it solves problems.” Originally a Lakers second-round pick, he’ll finally join the franchise that drafted him after signing a two-year veteran minimum contract. L.A. had the league’s third-best defensive rating last year, behind just Milwaukee and Gasol’s old team, Toronto, and he should further solidify an already strong defensive group. —B.P.84. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPerhaps because he plays in Sacramento, it’s gone somewhat unnoticed how downright Curry-esque Hield’s shooting has been since entering the NBA in 2016–17. Hield has the sixth-most threes in basketball over the last four seasons. Of the 16 players with at least 600 made triples in that span, Hield leads the pack in three-point percentage. The Oklahoma product shot a blistering 41.3% on catch-and-shoot triples last season. He ranked in the top 10 in pull-up threes made. Few players in the league are as talented at one specific skill. Hield may be a lethal three-point shooter, but he’s not earning All-NBA honors anytime soon. He’s not a physically imposing defender, and he’ll deliver his fair share of mental lapses on that end of the floor. Hield remains a middling playmaker, with limited skill off the bounce. Sacramento didn’t do him any favors playing at the league’s No. 20 pace last season, limiting the effectiveness of both him and De’Aaron Fox. A stylistic shift could boost both of Sacramento’s backcourt pieces in 2020–21. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated83. Goran Dragić, Miami HeatComing off the bench full-time for the first time since 2011, Dragić was still the Heat’s second-leading scorer in 2020. And when bumped into starting duty during the postseason, he took his game to another level, leading the team in scoring until his injury in Game 1 of the Finals. Dragić is a feisty competitor with a well-rounded offensive skill set. He’s often deadly in pick-and-rolls, adept at finding lanes against all varieties of big men. Dragić will pull up against slower footed centers who sag off him, or he’ll find a way to snake around a smaller five who wants to dance on the perimeter. He’s also a willing lob thrower, and when playing off the ball he can space the floor all around the arc thanks to his reliable shooting. Interestingly, for someone who frequently finds himself in the paint, you’d think Dragić would get to the free-throw line a touch more regularly than he currently does (4.2 attempts per game last season). And while he’s a heady team defender, Dragić can struggle at the point of attack, particularly against quick guards. Those issues are hardly dealbreakers, however, and any contending team would be happy to employ a malleable presence as Dragić. —R.N.82. Ricky Rubio, Minnesota TimberwolvesRubio entered the NBA as one of the most-hyped international players ever. Fans flocked to YouTube to track down clips of the dazzling Spanish star, who first appeared in Spain’s top professional league at 14 and held his own during the 2008 Olympics. The Timberwolves selected Rubio with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. And after three seasons away from the Twin Cities, the now 30-year-old guard has returned to the franchise that initially invested in him. Rubio’s first stint with the Timberwolves was largely marred by injury as an ACL tear cut short his promising rookie season and an ankle injury derailed his 2014–15 season. But the veteran guard has nevertheless been a solid, starting-caliber player, capable of being not only a prolific passer, but also a solid defender and decent three-point shooter. Last season, while with the Suns, Rubio averaged 13 points and 8.8 assists per game while also finishing the year in the top 10 in ESPN’s real plus-minus statistic for point guards. Upon being traded to Minnesota this offseason, he admitted he was a “different player than when I came here, and when I left.” While he won’t be the star they once imagined, he’ll be a solid veteran presence for a Timberwolves team building around D’Angelo Russell and top draft pick Anthony Edwards in the backcourt. —B.P.81. Eric Gordon, Houston RocketsGordon is a difficult evaluation after an injury-plagued 2019–20. Gordon underwent knee surgery in November, then battled a slate of lower-leg injuries throughout the season. When he did play, Gordon looked out of sorts. He posted the worst shooting season of his career, and Russell Westbrook’s control of the offense seemed to have a negative impact. But there’s reason to think Gordon’s dismal year was largely an outlier. With a new coach, new point guard and a clean bill of health, we should see the Gordon of old. At his best, Gordon is a perfect third guard in Houston’s offense. He’s an effective spot-up shooter with serious range, able to stretch the floor from far beyond the arc. Yet it’s not only Gordon’s shooting that makes him a valuable asset. He’s an impressive driver to the rim off the bounce, often punishing defenses who close out too hard on the perimeter. Gordon is more athletic and ferocious at the tin than his reputation suggests. His versatility gave the Warriors fits in the 2018 and 2019 playoffs. Gordon is a bit past his prime, and Houston likely regrets extending his contract. Value questions aside, Gordon remains an impactful weapon in the first year of the Stephen Silas era. —M.S.Jayne Kamin-Oncea/USA TODAY Sports80. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles LakersThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Harrell was the third-leading scorer on the 2020 Clippers. Now a member of the defending champion Lakers, LeBron and Anthony Davis can expect more of the same from Harrell. After initially making his name as a rim-runner with James Harden and the Rockets, Harrell has since added plenty of spice to his offensive repertoire. He’s an effective screener who has the hands to finish as a roll man. He can bully his way into favorable situations out of the post. And every now and then, he’ll also face up from the baseline and take his defender off the dribble. Put all that together, and Harrell averaged a career-best 18.6 points per game last season. The reason he isn’t higher on this list is his poor showing in the postseason, particularly his defensive struggles in the second round. Harrell is undersized as a 6’7” center, which can be an issue against skilled fives or on the glass. With Davis and Marc Gasol, the Lakers likely won’t ask Harrell to be doing as much against bigger front lines. His newest role should be his most streamlined one yet—all he has to do is keep scoring. —R.N.79. Jerami Grant, Detroit PistonsJerami Grant enters the season as one of the most interesting players to watch throughout the league. After playing 26.6 minutes per game largely as a reserve with the Nuggets, the versatile forward signed a three-year, $60 million deal with the Pistons this offseason. According to the Denver Post’s Mike Singer, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant and develop him more as a player, even offering him a similar deal. Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly later said publicly that the team was “under the assumption we would get something done.” But Pistons first-year general manager Troy Weaver said Grant was their top priority, and Grant said at his introductory Pistons press conference that the challenge of Detroit “intrigued” him. The 26-year-old will look to become a more complete player with the Pistons. He has proved to be a versatile defender and has shot nearly 40% from three in each of his past two seasons. However, it remains to be seen whether the former second-round pick can grow into a go-to scorer or merely a solid role player for years to come. —B.P.78. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzDespite losing in the first-round of last year’s postseason, the Jazz are again banking on roster continuity to pay dividends. Among the players expected to contribute in important roles is Ingles. The 33-year-old forward started just 45 games in 2019–20, his lowest total since his third year with the franchise, and he at times struggled to adjust back to a reserve role after becoming an every-night starter in 2017–18 and 2018–19. But he enters this season still playing the role of an essential secondary creator who won’t overstep his ability. Ingles shot 39.9% from three last season and was a steadying defensive presence for a Utah team that went 44–28. In the postseason, the 6’7’’ Australian saw his minutes increase even though he struggled, by his standards, in Utah’s lone playoff series, shooting just 35% from deep. There is little uncertainty to Ingles’s game, and he remains a crafty perimeter player any winning team would want to have. —B.P.77. Gary Harris, Denver NuggetsWill the real Gary Harris please stand up? A frustrating run of injuries has limited his availability the past two seasons, and his efficiency has dipped. But Harris is still just 26, and the established value of his skill set bodes well. His penchant for cutting and spotting up and his embrace of difficult matchups on the other end of the ball allow him to fit in with just about anyone. With the Nuggets’ most potent lineups likely to include Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter together, Harris’s feel for complementing others, limiting mistakes and making plays in a pinch has never been more critical. It’s one thing to find a player who’s willing to fit in, but another entirely when the crux of his game is so well suited for just that. The thought he might become Denver’s third star has subsided, but if clean health and renewed confidence are in the cards, Harris’s shooting percentages ought to trend back upward, adding the requisite punch that would return him to form. A thorough understanding of Harris’s value has always been best obtained by watching closely, not poring over his numbers. —J.W.76. Bogdan Bogdanović, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks shelled out $72 million for Bogdanović in the offseason, and his offensive skill set should make the contract a worthwhile play for Atlanta. Bogdanović projects to be an idyllic backcourt mate for Trae Young, sporting a 40.7% mark on catch-and-shoot triples in 2019–20. Bogdanović is a quality spacer, but perhaps more importantly, he sports the playmaking ability to take some share of the offense from Young. Atlanta’s franchise cornerstone is an immensely gifted offensive player, but the Hawks’ offense stalled at times as Young dominated possession after possession. Some balance should help both Young and the team’s development in 2020–21. Bogdanović also provides more than what you see on the stat sheet. He has a reputation as a fierce competitor and intense personality, and he provides important size in the backcourt alongside the diminutive Young. Atlanta has its eyes set on the playoffs in 2021. Adding Bogdanović was a major step toward making that happen. — M.S.75. Zach LaVine, Chicago BullsVolume scorers are perhaps the trickiest players to place in an exercise like this, and there may be no better example than LaVine, who placed 11th in the league with a career-high 25.5 points per game. As he’s matured, he’s curtailed some of his mid-range proclivities in favor of more threes and rim attempts, which has been a step in the right direction. Doing what he’s done is not an easy task, and capable shot-creators with his size and explosiveness are few and far between. Whether his preferred style of play—which has never involved much defense—can run conducive to team success is still the question hanging over his real value. He’s not an elite jump shooter or play finisher, nor is he a free-throw-drawing monster, and creating for others has never been a major piece of his identity, either. If he’s stretched himself to his limits putting the ball in the basket, LaVine will need to evolve in a different direction to make the most of his considerable ability. He remains one of the most impressive athletes in the NBA, and his ability to create for himself could still be meaningful to a winning team. His prime years may be defined by his capacity to adjust. —J.W.74. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix SunsThere were reasons for caution regarding Ayton’s outlook early in his career. His efficient rookie season was marred by a lack of physicality and defensive intensity, and he started out 2019–20 with a 25-game PED suspension. But Ayton’s 38-game sample last season should provide significant optimism for the young center’s future. Ayton is one of the game’s most skilled young centers, and with him flanked by two All-Star guards, a monster 2020–21 could be in store. Ayton’s offensive skills jump off the screen in a variety of ways. He sports a soft touch near the rim and around the foul line, and he’s a prodigious force in the pick-and-roll. Ayton averaged 1.16 points per roll possession last season. He shot nearly 55% from the field. There’s still growth to be had on the defensive end, but those problems should be solved with added experience. With Chris Paul now in the fold, Ayton could very well rocket up our Top 100 entering 2021–22. — M.S.73. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsWith Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green no longer in Toronto, Anunoby was thrust into a starting role last season, and he excelled. Anunoby is kind of the platonic ideal of a three-and-D guy. He shot 39.0% from behind the arc in 2020 and played stellar defense on the other end of the floor. At 6’ 7”, Anunoby is perfect for the modern NBA because of his ability to guard multiple positions and allow for lineup flexibility. The Raptors maintained their championship-level defense last year despite the high-profile departures, and that was in large part because Anunoby was ready for the responsibility of matching up with talented wings. While he may not be a pure shutdown defender just yet, OG has all the tools to enter the upper echelon of stoppers, and he’s already giving people trouble. His athleticism gives his offense a little bit of bounce as well. He doesn’t have to be a pure catch-and-shoot guy, though getting his three-point attempts up would be a welcome sight. With Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka now gone as well, the Raptors are well removed from their 2019 championship squad. Expect an even bigger role for Anunoby moving forward. — R.N.72. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksIt’s quite possible Lopez exemplifies the shift in the role of the modern big man better than any other player in the league. Throughout his first six NBA seasons with the Nets, he took just seven total three-pointers. But in 2016–17, he fired 387 threes, up from 14 total the year prior. Lopez saw his three-point percentage drop from 36.5% to 31.4% last season, his second in Milwaukee. However, he remained an ideal stretch five who frequently stepped out on the perimeter, but was still able to punish smaller defenders around the rim. The 32-year-old center also has evolved into a centerpiece of Milwaukee’s league-best defense, finishing fifth overall in ESPN’s real plus-minus for centers last year and third in defensive real plus-minus. While Lopez played just 26.7 minutes per game in the regular season, his minutes increased to 32.8 per game in the playoffs. Expect a similar trend this season with the team looking to make its first finals appearance since the 1973–74 season. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated71. JJ Redick, New Orleans PelicansDon’t be fooled by the quantity of podcasts, entering his 15th season, Redick remains one of the most accomplished marksmen in the Association. In his first season with the Pelicans, the veteran had the second-best three-point shooting mark of his career, connecting on 45.3% of his attempts from beyond the arc. If anything, Redick was slightly underutilized on a young New Orleans team, playing his fewest minutes per game (26.4) since 2011. Redick offers space as soon as he steps on the floor, and his conditioning at age 36 should be commended. His constant movement generates open looks despite the undivided attention of his defender. While Redick’s own defense isn’t sterling—the Pels were 3.7 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Redick off the floor—he’s still more than capable of staying on the court in high leverage moments, the key test for any specialist. Of course, while he has acquired a particular set of skills over a long career that can make him a nightmare for opponents, Redick’s narrow scope means he’s at his most valuable on a team already studded with stars. Whether or not Redick is in the perfect role for himself on an up-and-comer, he should continue to provide some much-needed room for Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram through 2021. —R.N 70. P.J. Tucker, Houston RocketsJames Harden has transformed the Rockets franchise over the last decade, but P.J. Tucker remains Houston’s heartbeat. Since the start of the 2012-13 season, he has played the most games (637) of any player in the league and even entering his age-36 season, Tucker is an elite defensive force. Only the game’s truest behemoths can gain an inch on Tucker in the post. Few guards can skate by him on an island. Houston’s switch-everything scheme in prior years would have been rendered completely ineffective without Tucker’s presence. He has his limits offensively, but finds a way to provide value on that end of the floor. He’s become one of the league’s most effective corner-three specialists, and he’s developed a canny floater in recent years. Tucker’s smarts and versatility have made him an invaluable cog in Houston over the last three seasons, and until further notice. —M.S.69. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksCapela is the forgotten man in Atlanta’s rotation after the Hawks’ offseason makeover. Much of the focus has been on the acquisitions of Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari, but the Hawks should have a marked upgrade at center as well in 2020–21. Capela isn’t in the top tier of centers—largely due to his limited offensive skill set—though when healthy, he can truly be a dominant interior force. Capela may in essence function as Atlanta’s most important addition. The former Rockets center is a gifted athlete. He’s a quality lob threat, and more importantly, he can hold his own on an island with wings and guards. Capela is at his best in transition. He feasted on free dunks off James Harden outlets in Houston, beating the likes of Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokić down the floor time and again. If Atlanta relies on a quick tempo in 2020–21, Capela could truly thrive. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated68. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsIt’s possible Smart’s career-best 2018–19 season—when he appeared to take a step forward as a scorer—was something of a mirage in terms of shooting. But if he’s proved one thing over the years, it’s that there’s a method behind his unique brand of chaotic good. Smart is an energy-giver in a way that few, if any, of his peers can truly match, flying around defensively to create stops, occasionally catching fire from distance, and ratcheting up the intensity level of a given moment. He’ll never be the king of efficiency, but he’s fashioned himself into a more reliable jump shooter over the years. Smart doesn’t always take care, but he always cares, sometimes more than he should, always for the right reasons. There will be nights he struggles to find the net, and others where one or two particularly inspired Smart shifts can swing the outcome of a game. He’s become an indispensable piece of one of the NBA’s better teams, and he’s earned first-team all-defense honors in consecutive years. And in an exercise like this that attempts to remove players from their contexts, his situational worth to the Celtics might even be slightly undersold. —J.W.67. Eric Bledsoe, New Orleans PelicansThe Pelicans come into this season as one of the NBA’s most intriguing teams, with a number of high-upside young players, recently acquired veterans and a new coaching staff eager to lead them to the postseason. Among those vets is Bledsoe, who joins New Orleans after nearly three full seasons with the Bucks. At times, he looked like a potential franchise centerpiece and All-Star-caliber guard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Other times, the Kentucky product looked lost and unable to snap out of various funks. Bledsoe provides the Pelicans with defensive physicality and will certainly help orchestrate New Orleans’ offense, anchored by Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. But much of Bledsoe’s reputation has been defined by his playoff struggles, having shot just 25% from three-point range in last year’s postseason and just 23.6% from deep in the 2018–19 playoffs. He certainly won’t have the same spotlight on him in New Orleans that he did in Milwaukee, and as a result, maybe he flourishes for a team with more modest aspirations. He remains a difficult player to stop in transition and a solid rebounder, especially for a guard who is just 6’1’’. It’s unlikely he’ll ever make an All-Star team, but don’t be surprised if he looks more like the guard that averaged more than 20 points per game in Phoenix. —B.P.66. Robert Covington, Portland Trail BlazersCovington is largely an ideal three-and-D forward, especially on the defensive end. The Tennessee State product can legitimately defend both guards and larger wings, excelling as a weak-side helper. Only two players tallied more steals in 2019–20. Just nine finished with more blocks. Covington should continue to be a valuable defensive asset in Portland, where he’ll excel as a versatile frontcourt piece alongside Jusuf Nurkić and Derrick Jones Jr. Covington should help the Blazers secure a playoff spot in an increasingly crowded West. There are some offensive shortcomings to note with Covington. He’s more of a stationary shooter than anything on the offensive end, and his jumper ebbs and flows more than one would like. Covington struggled mightily from three in the NBA bubble, and while that may be a small sample, he’s never been a truly knockdown shooter. Perhaps playing alongside Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum will generate more wide-open looks in 2020–21. —M.S.65. Al Horford, Oklahoma City ThunderHorford has taken a relative tumble in his reputation across the league after an ill-fated stint in Philadelphia, but the five-time All-Star should be a stabilizing force for a young Oklahoma City team in 2020–21. Horford was relegated to spacer status alongside Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, zapping him of his best skills as an offensive player. Horford is a terrific interior passer and effective pick-and-roll partner. It’s easy to see him forming a quick rapport with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is additionally crafty in the two-man game. Horford’s intelligence could have an effect similar to Chris Paul’s in Oklahoma City, though it’s unlikely to be truly reflected in the standings. For a team now deep into its rebuild, Horford provides professionalism and competence. He should be better in 2020–21 than he was in his final year in Philadelphia. —M.S.64. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesMemphis’s future is bright after a string of lottery appearances, and not solely because of Ja Morant. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke are two of the Western Conference’s more exciting young forwards, looking like a potential top three in the years to come. A little lottery luck has gone a long way, leading to plenty of optimism surrounding Taylor Jenkins’ squad. Jackson shined in his second NBA season, making a significant leap as a three-point shooter. The Michigan State product shot 39.4% from beyond the arc on 6.5 attempts per game, more than LeBron James, Jaylen Brown and Joe Harris. And Jackson’s skill isn’t solely tied to his value from three. He averaged 1.24 points per roll possession, sporting comparable numbers to Rudy Gobert and Bam Adebayo. He’s foul-prone, but a versatile defender, who should be even better on that end as he gets stronger. Morant has a pair of true weapons in the frontcourt, headlined by the former Spartan. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated63. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City ThunderThe Thunder’s premeditated decision to tear down a longtime playoff team came with Gilgeous-Alexander’s best long-term interests in mind. He makes his Top 100 debut on the cusp of stardom, and with another step forward in his development, this ranking may end up looking unnecessarily patient. There are few guards anywhere who check as many crucial, creative boxes: He handles with an unpredictable cadence, he’s dangerous in ball screens, boasts catch-and-shoot chops, and can lean on a reliable in-between game when he can’t get to the rim. At 22 years old—and standing 6’ 5”—Gilgeous-Alexander has displayed prodigious comfort in all those areas. He’s good at pretty much everything already, and in his third season will inherit a heavy on-ball workload for the first time, with shooters around him. The big unknowns are to what degree he can amplify his playmaking skills (in two seasons as more of a secondary handler, his assist-to-turnover ratio is a respectable 1.8), and just how dangerous he’ll become shooting from distance. Defenses will consistently key on him for the first time, and he’ll be tested. But based on all we’ve seen, it feels like a simple matter of time before his next meaningful leap. —J.W.62. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsFor a player who has yet to make an All-Star team, Nets guard LeVert has been one of the most talked about players in the league. He’s shown improvement in each of his four seasons, tallying career highs in points (18.7), rebounds (4.2), assists (4.4), three-point shooting (36.4%) and minutes (29.6) per game last season. But the question remains whether he’s merely a high-quality secondary option or whether he could lead a team on a daily basis, and in turn, whether he could be the centerpiece of a trade for another star. This summer, LeVert shed some light on that question, leading the shorthanded Nets to a 5–3 record as he moved from a secondary scorer to a primary ballhandler and scoring role in the bubble. And while the Raptors discharged the Nets in four games, the 6' 6\" guard averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 assists per contest on 18 shots per game. LeVert admitted during media week that he’s heard the noise around his name in rumors, but said that team general manager Sean Marks has been an “open book” in terms of keeping the 26-year-old informed. “Whatever happens, it was meant to be,” LeVert said recently. Maybe he’ll become the Nets’ true third star alongside Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, or maybe he’ll get moved. Either way, LeVert has shown steady improvement throughout his career, and has a strong foundation to build off. —B.P.61. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicIs Gordon still an up-and-coming player, or has he hit his ceiling? It’s a question that remains tough to definitively answer, and one that can similarly be asked about the Magic. Still just 25 years old, Gordon averaged 14.4 points on just over 12 shots per game last season, down from the past two. He remains a versatile forward capable of guarding four positions if needed, but it also appears clear with every season that he’ll never be more than an average three-point shooter, thus limiting his offensive ceiling. Gordon still flashes glimpses that remind people of Blake Griffin, Draymond Green and Pascal Siakam, but there are other times he looks like he’d be better suited as a secondary or tertiary option. Gordon is no doubt a capable player, but with unrestricted free agency two full seasons away, more clarity about his future—or how teams value him—will come sooner than later. —B.P.60. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersBoston appeared to pass on taking Turner in a potential Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade, perhaps a questionable decision given Turner’s impressive talent. Though he isn’t exactly a brick wall on the low block, he’s established himself as an elite weak-side shot blocker, with 2.1 blocks per game in 2019–20. Turner adds impressive stretch capability from beyond the arc as well, canning 37% of threes on 446 attempts over the last two seasons. Turner is a malleable offensive piece for the modern game. He’s likely worth the $52.5 million owed over the next three years. Turner provides quality versatility, but his offensive skill set does leave something to be desired at times. He doesn’t pair his range with any real physicality, and he’s not exactly quick enough to beat bigs off the dribble when they chase him onto the arc. Turner is a bit of a stationary shooter, albeit a quality one. His age and shot profile suggests he can be an impactful force for years to come. But without further offensive development, there is likely a ceiling on Turner’s potential. —M.S.59. John Collins, Atlanta HawksAtlanta gave its roster a major makeover ahead of 2020-21, shelling out nine figures for Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari in a push to reach the postseason. The pair of free-agent signings will be joined by frontcourt newcomers Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, creating a short-term logjam. But the added pieces won’t cut into Collins’s production as much as one may think. The Wake Forest has been a prodigious offensive force and will be a part of unlocking Atlanta’s tantalizing ceiling. Collins is an ideal frontcourt player alongside Trae Young, at least on the offensive end. His evolving jumper—40.1 percent from three in 2019–20—creates legitimate spacing in pick-and-pop scenarios, and Collins is downright lethal as a roll man. He averaged 1.31 points per roll possession last season, posting a better mark than Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo and Rudy Gobert. Collins can put the ball on the floor in tight spaces, and he’s an elite leaper at the rim. You can quibble with his defensive shortcomings, as well as his lack of a true position at 6' 9\". But Collins’s offensive skills are undeniable. He should command a nine-figure contract next summer, even if he moves on from Atlanta. —M.S.58. Andre Drummond, Cleveland CavaliersThe Cavaliers acquired Drummond last February in a surprising, but relatively low-risk deal that sent Brandon Knight, John Henson and a 2023 second-round pick back to Detroit. The bruising center played eight games with the Cavaliers, who later picked up his $28 million player option. While pricey, Drummond would appear to be more of a short-term option for a rebuilding team. He’ll get the opportunity to try and mesh with All-Star forward Kevin Love in the Cavs’ frontcourt as the franchise looks to develop lottery picks Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro alongside them. Drummond is still a rebound eater, having led the league in each of the past three seasons. He is also a force around the rim, scoring the third-most paint points per game in the league (10.8). Cleveland finished last season with the league’s second-worst defense, and a full season of Drummond should also help improve those numbers, if only marginally. He said recently that his plan this offseason was “always to come back to Cleveland.” The two-time All-Star remains a high-quality player, but for better or worse, he’s still a stat stuffer on a young team. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated57. Fred VanVleet, Toronto RaptorsYet another Raptor who stepped up in the wake of Kawhi's walking away, VanVleet posted career numbers practically across the board in 2019–20. The 26-year-old recorded personal bests in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throw attempts and three-pointers made per game. FVV excelled in a bigger role, also commanding chief ball-handling duties when Kyle Lowry missed time with injuries. VanVleet is dubiously listed at 6' 0\", but makes up for his size by frequently barreling his way into the paint and collapsing the defense. He’s also long been a knockdown shooter, and he hit 39% of his threes last year while increasing his volume significantly. And he’s just as proficient on the defensive end. VanVleet’s defense at the point of attack is sterling. Watching him and Lowry hound opposing guards well above the three-point line is thoroughly entertaining. In the conference semifinals, Boston’s offense struggled mightily in the half court, in large part because of VanVleet’s ability to fight over screens and cut off lanes to the paint. Toronto will probably need even more from VanVleet this upcoming season. The departure of Marc Gasol takes away a halfcourt creator. Can VanVleet lead the team in assists? Can he lead the team in scoring? After signing a four-year, $85 million contract in the offseason—and with Lowry on an expiring deal—it’s clear VanVleet is a cornerstone of the Raptors’ future. There’s certainly room for improvement here, like finishing at the rim or bumping up his percentage on pull-up threes. Considering VanVleet’s path to this season—entering the league as an undrafted free agent, proving he could stick, then starring in a Finals against Stephen Curry—the Raptors should be confident he can continue to grow. —R.N. 56. Bojan Bogdanović Utah JazzBogdanović made a name for himself in the NBA as an effective three-point shooter, but the six-year veteran is a significantly more versatile offensive option than he’s been given credit for. Donovan Mitchell remains the headliner in Utah, and Rudy Gobert could very well earn a $200 million deal next offseason. While the Jazz are anchored by those stars, Bogdanović remains an indispensable piece. We’d be remiss not to mention his elite shooting in recent seasons. He is one of six players with at least 500 threes at over 40% over the last three seasons, and his range extends multiple feet beyond the arc. Utah often faces clogged lanes due to the presence of Gobert. Bogdanović’s considerable floor-spacing threat helps alleviate that issue. He also provides valuable scoring off the bounce, which is critical for a Utah offense that at times appears stuck in mud. It’s not blazing speed that fuels him, but rather an innate feel for the other nine players on the floor. Bogdanovic can slither around a Gobert pick en route to the rim. He can pump-fake his way past a defender for a two-dribble pull-up. It’s not the most aesthetically thrilling game, but he can light up the scoreboard in a hurry. Utah is often better than the sum of its parts given the roster’s offensive shortcomings. Bogdanovic’s presence is key to unlocking the Jazz’s attack. —M.S.55.  Domantas Sabonis, Indiana PacersThough he’s not quite a household name, Sabonis comes into this season looking to build on a breakout 2019–20 campaign. The versatile big played 34.8 minutes per game last season, setting career highs for points (18.5), rebounds (12.4) and assists (5.0) per game. His arsenal features a throwback post-up game, and he’s already a prolific screener and passer, throwing the third-most passes per game in the league last year. Indiana is now led by first-year coach Nate Bjorkgren, who has already publicly marveled at Sabonis’s ability. “From Domas being able to just put so much pressure on the rim,” Bjorkgren said, “I just know coaching against him in the past, his ability to screen and dive hard and how physical he is.” He made his first All-Star team last year, and with Victor Oladipo’s and Myles Turner’s long-term futures with the Pacers uncertain, Sabonis appears to be one of the franchise’s centerpieces. The 24-year-old was missed in last year’s postseason, and Indiana was subsequently swept for the third time in four years. If the Pacers want to remain among the conference’s top teams, a lot will be riding on the shoulders of their budding star. —B.P.54. Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana PacersIt’s hard to separate Brogdon from his frontcourt partner, Domantas Sabonis, hence their adjacent placement on this list. The two displayed an almost immediate chemistry in pick-and-roll situations last year, Brogdon’s first with the franchise. The 6' 5\" Brogdon is the epitome of a combo guard, fully able to play either an on-ball or off-ball role. He averaged 16.5 points and 7.1 assists in 2019–20 and will again play a central role in orchestrating a Pacers attack that features not only Sabonis, but also T.J. Warren, Myles Turner and Victor Oladipo. How Brogdon will fit alongside Oladipo is among Indiana’s biggest questions heading into this season. Brogdon also saw his three-point shooting slip from 42.6% in 2018–19, his last year with Milwaukee, to just 32.6% with the Pacers. But the crafty Brogdon has outperformed expectations throughout the entirety of his career, and seems poised for a return to form with more help around him. —B.P.53. Gordon Hayward, Charlotte HornetsHayward’s ill-fated Boston tenure has diminished his perceived value across the league, but despite some dampened athleticism, he joins the Hornets as a still-impactful offensive force. Hayward is a quality shooter, to be sure, but that’s arguably the least impressive element of his dynamic skill set. Hayward sports the instincts of a point guard. He’s quick to advance the ball up the floor in transition, and he’s an expert at skipping the ball from the wing to the opposite corner with either hand. Hayward also excels snaking in and out of the pick-and-roll, able to keep defenders on his hip before contorting his body around bigs around the rim. Don’t let his injury history obscure his offensive value. He was relegated to secondary scorer status in Boston, spending most nights as a spot-up specialist, but could see a relative career revival in Charlotte. Hayward can dictate much of the offense alongside LaMalo Ball, and we could even see a sneaky two-man game develop between them. Charlotte would be smart to increase its pace with Hayward and Ball, capitalizing on each player’s vision and skill in the open court. Is $120 million too rich for Hayward? Perhaps. But he should still make a marked impact with the given good health in 2020–21. —M.S.52. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersHarris has emerged as an effective three-point shooter in recent seasons, canning 39.3% of triples over the last three seasons on fairly significant volume. But forcing Harris to largely stand on the perimeter seems to be an underutilization of his skills. He sports a smooth jumper off the bounce, and while he’s not the most explosive leaper, he’s one of the league’s more creative finishers for a player of his size. Harris’s first two years in Philadelphia have been marred by a misuse of his talents, but Brett Brown shouldn’t be completely excoriated. Philadelphia is led by a behemoth center and a point guard without any discernible jump shot, and last year’s roster featured a stunning lack of shooters. Harris was often the lone spot-up option on the floor. Doc Rivers’s tenure should be different. Seth Curry will open up the floor to a significant degree. Simmons should take at least a small step forward with his shot. Let’s hope Harris earns a greater share of playmaking duties in 2020–21, allowing his impressive offensive arsenal to shine. —M.S.51. John Wall, Houston RocketsPlacing Wall in the point guard hierarchy as he returns from multiple serious injuries in his left leg, including a torn Achilles, is a precarious exercise. He returns to the Top 100 as a member of the Rockets, having missed the better part of the last three seasons and trying to regain his footing. Wall is purportedly close to full strength, but a scary question hangs over what remains of his prime years: What happens if the fastest player in the NBA loses any meaningful amount of the interplanetary burst that made him great? Of course, Wall is a terrific passer, but his ability to stretch defenses in transition has always played a role in his gaudy assist totals. He’s always been ball-dominant, and his three-point shooting has rarely been far above average, with his 37% clip over 41 games in 2017–18 looking like an outlier. Wall now joins a Houston team in a role that will stretch the limits of his skill set, as a defined second star alongside the NBA’s usage god himself, James Harden. Even if he looks like his old self, he’ll be asked to mesh in a way he never has before, spotting up, cutting and making himself useful when the ball isn’t in his hands. If the reports about his return to form are accurate, Wall should make this ranking look foolish. But as he hits the other side of 30, his checkered health history, volatile shooting splits, and limited versatility are inseparable from the value conversation. —J.W.50. Mike Conley, Utah JazzConley got off to a rocky start in Utah, adjusting alongside another ball-dominant guard in Donovan Mitchell and appearing in just 47 games due to injuries. By February and March, his play had returned to his usual standard, and he was mostly effective in the bubble, assuaging concerns that his performance level was anywhere close to cratering. Now 33, he remains one of the league’s more calming forces, historically great at limiting turnovers, reading the floor and knowing where the ball should be at any given time. Between some inevitable physical decline, his limited impact on defense and a drop in efficiency, there’s some slight regression taking place. But the tenets of Conley’s game—heady play, dangerous jump shooting, and comfort under pressure—remain sharp as ever. He may not be the piece that gets the Jazz over the hump, but a second full season, health pending, will offer a far better sense of what he has left in the tank. As the third wheel on a well-built team, with a heightened comfort level, Conley is poised to bounce back in a meaningful way. —J.W.49. Danilo Gallinari, Atlanta HawksThe addition of top free agent Gallinari will surely boost a Hawks team that went 20–47 last season. Whether starting or coming off the bench, the 32-year-old remains a high-quality piece, providing his team with a mix of perimeter shooting and fairly versatile defending. While he hasn’t played more than 70 games in a season since 2012–13, Gallinari was a solid contributor for the Thunder last year, averaging 18.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists while averaging less than 30 minutes of action. A 40.5% shooter from three, Gallinari will help the Hawks on the perimeter, as Atlanta was the league’s worst three-point shooting team last season. He will also pair nicely with Trae Young, having shot nearly 42% on catch-and-shoot threes last year. While Gallinari’s three-year, reported $61.5 million contract might be a little steep of a bill to pay—it’s the largest multi-year contract ever for a player older than 30 who has never made an All-Star team—he should make a Hawks roster loaded with young talent more competitive in the short term. —B.P.48. Steven Adams, New Orleans PelicansWhile Adams rarely gets full credit for his services, he remains a king of positional nuance and, of course, a man of prodigious strength. He anchored playoff-caliber Thunder defenses for five straight seasons, regularly finishes among the NBA’s leaders in screen assists and offensive rebounds and occupies an unusually large amount of precious space around the rim. He doesn’t block a ton of shots. His presence dissuades all but the most daring drivers from approaching. Adams doesn’t shoot jumpers, but he frees teammates for open ones with well-angled, incidentally bone-crushing picks. Though he doesn’t rack up gaudy rebound totals like some of his peers, Adams’s dedication to boxing out has often led to extra defensive boards for teammates (see: Westbrook, Russell) and transition opportunities for all. Part of what makes him special is that, by all accounts, he’s never cared about those numbers to begin with. Even with a chunk of the NBA veering toward small-ball, Adams remains a difference-maker and an anchor. There’s a reason the Pelicans are banking on the Adams effect—that his ability to physically dominate tight spaces will create better opportunities for others, as they always have. —J.W.47. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersJust because he’s stuck on an inconsequential Cleveland team doesn’t mean Kevin Love couldn’t have value for a franchise with higher aspirations in the present. After an injury-marred 2019 campaign, Love played in 56 games for the Cavaliers during their shortened 2020. His numbers remained largely the same as they have for most of his tenure with the Cavs, averaging 17.6 points and 9.8 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.4% from three. Perhaps the biggest issue for Love is how he plays for a rebuilding team mired in obscurity. His most notable highlight from last season was probably when he intentionally took a three-second call seemingly in protest of his young teammates Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. Love’s numbers indicate that he could probably still be of service to a contender, but it’s fair to wonder if time is running out. The 2008 draftee is now 32 years old. While 2020 was solid health wise, in the previous three seasons Love never played in more than 60 regular season games. And though the defensive spotlight on him was artificially heightened because of the Cavs Finals runs of yesteryear, Love is still far from an anchor on that side of the ball. Those reasons are likely why he didn’t pop up during an offseason filled with trades, despite having a contract that runs only through 2023—and actually decreases in value his final season. Unless a motivated Love again plays for a team with some level of competitiveness, it can be difficult to discern where he fits into the NBA landscape. That’s how a five-time All-Star ends up floating around the middle of this list. — R.NBrad Rempel/USA TODAY Sports46. D’Angelo Russell, Minnesota TimberwolvesRussell enters the year hoping to lead the Timberwolves to just their second postseason appearance since 2003–04, in what will be his first full season with the franchise. Russell was traded to Minnesota last February and averaged 21.7 points and 6.6 assists per game in 12 games with the team. He has developed into a productive player, capable of playing both on- and off-ball, and he should elevate his close friend and franchise cornerstone Karl-Anthony Towns. Russell will also likely spend a lot of time playing alongside veteran guard Ricky Rubio, whom Russell recently said will take pressure off him in much the same way he did for Devin Booker in Phoenix and Donovan Mitchell in Utah. While Russell has struggled defensively, Minnesota management has made it clear that they view Russell as a centerpiece of the franchise. After months of waiting, Russell said he’s excited for what the season could hold. —B.P.45. Blake Griffin, Detroit PistonsWe’ll never see Blake Griffin return to his Lob City form after an array of knee injuries, but the modern version of Griffin can still be downright delightful. The former No. 1 pick is an effective point-forward and a quality three-point shooter. His passing instincts (always underrated) are as sharp as ever. It’s a shame Griffin has largely faded from relevance as he toils away in Detroit. Place Griffin on a contender, and perhaps we’d be celebrating his late-career resurgence. Griffin isn’t exactly a knock-down shooter, but he posts solid percentages considering his significant leap in three-point volume. Griffin attempted 322 threes in 2017–18 and 522 the next season, shooting a respectable 35.5% from beyond the arc. Only seven players hit more off-the-dribble threes in 2018–19, and Griffin retained his prowess in transition at 1.22 points per possession. Griffin sees the floor like few players his size. He’s a terrific big-to-big passer in the lane, and his vision out of the pick-and-roll mirrors that of a quality point guard. Let’s hope we see Griffin in the postseason again one way or another, after his disappointing exits with the Clippers. — M.S.44. Jusuf Nurkić, Portland Trail BlazersIt took more than a year for Nurkić to make his return from a badly broken leg. His triumphant comeback proved one of the summer bubble’s most exciting developments. He showed up having shed weight and picked up where he left off and then some, backing the Blazers all the way to a surprise playoff berth. The best part was how sustainable it all feels. Nurkić’s sublime passing skills and crafty interior game was abetted by a little extra vertical oomph under the basket. His defensive positioning has typically been sound, but he appeared to be moving his feet better than ever. He looked legitimately athletic. With his playmaking and sheer size, Nurkić has fashioned himself into one of the NBA’s best screen-and roll threats, able to command an extra shred of attention while teammates create off him, punish switches, and elevate to the rim when given space. Opponents can ill afford to counter him with smaller bigs, and while he’ll never defend much on an island, he’s harder to play off the floor defensively due to his toughness and commitment. Nurkić was inching closer to his fully realized self even before reshaping his body. He may have unlocked something extra in the process. — J.W.43. Nikola Vučević, Orlando MagicOrlando has a serious logjam in the frontcourt, with shoddy guard play and less-than-ideal spacing often limiting its ceiling. Vučević doesn’t seem to mind. As the NBA continues to emphasize stretch and speed, Vučević remains a highly valuable throwback big. He tallied the sixth-most post-up opportunities in the league last season, and only one more player logged more roll attempts. These aren’t criticisms. Vučević is a quality mid-range shooter, and he can finish effectively with either hand. At times, it still feels as though there’s something missing despite Vučević’s impressive point totals. Vučević’s defensive impact is middling. His rebound percentage and free-throw rates fell last year compared to 2018–19. But he’s become more efficient thanks to an increase in three-point attempts, and with different pieces around him, you still wonder whether he might have more to offer. — M.S.42. Victor Oladipo, Indiana PacersAfter tearing his quadriceps almost two full years ago, Victor Oladipo has yet to consistently display his old explosiveness. As an example, in 2017–18—his last full season—Oladipo attempted 10.8 drives per game, shooting on nearly half of them and converting his attempts at a 52% clip. Last season, despite just a 19-game sample size, he drove to the basket two times fewer per game, and saw his shooting percentage on drives drop to 39.7%. If Indiana is to maintain relevance in the Eastern Conference, he’ll need to re-acclimate himself. New Pacers head coach Nate Bjorkgren told reporters that Oladipo has looked like he has “a lot of bounce to him” this training camp, but it remains unclear whether Oladipo will appear in back-to-back games, something he didn’t do last year in an abridged return. The 28-year-old guard’s future with the franchise also appears to be in doubt, with trade rumors circulating. But a bounce-back would do plenty for his value, and the short-term health of the Pacers. — B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated41. Ja Morant, Memphis GrizzliesHow many point guards, let alone 20-year-old rookies, could have led the collection of parts on Memphis’s roster to the cusp of playoff contention? Consider for a second the fact that the tenets of Morant’s explosive style translated directly from the Ohio Valley conference, in transition and the halfcourt, without a fully reliable jump shot. Morant’s Rookie of the Year case was a simple one. He stepped into the NBA and immediately became one of its best playmakers, capable of delivering accurate passes on the move and near-impossible to keep out of the paint. Functionally ambidextrous as a passer and finisher, whenever he gets there, his devastating dunks and craft around the rim threaten equally. Few rookie guards have ever shown up quite so ballsy and unafraid, and while he’s still learning to curb turnovers and defend with intent, it matters that Morant cares less about showmanship and more about making the right play, rarely shooting just to shoot or passing for the sake of it. His brilliance aside, the young Grizzlies were just the league’s 21st-ranked offense last season. As his game evolves, so will the expectations. Still, you shudder at the thought of what might happen if he continues to meet them. — J.W.40. Kristaps Porzingis, Dallas MavericksThere are few players in league history quite like Porzingis when he’s healthy. For now, he’s still rehabbing a knee injury that will delay his start to the season. The former Knicks cornerstone is a true unicorn at 7’3”, banging home triples at range. Porzingis tallied 403 three-point attempts in just 57 games last year, and he provided significantly more value from three than his 35.2 % mark would suggest. Porzingis’s ability to stretch well beyond 25 feet creates significant driving lanes for Luka Dončić, and allows the Dončić–Dwight Powell pick-and-roll to thrive. Porzingis is no slouch as a roll man himself. He generates a healthy 1.17 points per roll possession, using his mammoth frame to rise above defenders. It’s understandable that Dallas uses Porzingis as a spacer so consistently. But an added dose of screening action in Porzingis’s diet should help both the talented center and Dallas’s superstar guard. — M.S.39. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeRozan is as steady as he is crafty. The 31-year-old guard enters this season as one of just five players to score 1,500 or more points in each of the last five years. Though the Spurs’ 22-year playoff appearance streak ended last season, DeRozan remained a productive force on the floor, averaging 22.1 points, 5.6 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 53.1% from the field. He effectively moonlighted at power forward for a shorthanded team in the bubble, his mid-range skills and craftiness still highly useful. Throughout DeRozan’s first decade in the NBA, he has always been a limited three-point shooter, never making more than three attempts on average per game. In his first season in San Antonio, DeRozan averaged just 0.6 threes per game, converting on just 15.6% of his attempts. While that percentage improved to 25.7% last season, DeRozan will always be a limited commodity from behind the arc, limiting some of his market value, but not his effectiveness. While a move to a contender could be an eventuality, for now, DeRozan returns to San Antonio, providing a stable presence and consistent scoring.— B.P.38. Jaylen Brown, Boston CelticsThere’s no team in the NBA that couldn’t gainfully employ Jaylen Brown, one of the sharpest players in the league both on and off the floor. Brown, in the absence of Kyrie Irving and with Gordon Hayward in and out of the lineup, put together his best season as a pro in 2020. The 24-year-old averaged career highs in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throws, and three-pointers per game. Phew. Brown has always been a heady player, thriving within his means and not trying to take on the mantle of No. 1 scorer. That kind of awareness is incredibly valuable to a roster like Boston’s, with an established All-Star in Kemba Walker and a budding superstar in Jayson Tatum. And that’s not to say Brown, who put up 20.3 points a night, can’t hold his own. For now, Brown is perfectly cast as Boston’s No. 2b scorer to Kemba Walker’s 2a. (Walker averaged 0.1 points more per game than last season.) Brown is the kind of player who can fill in gaps offensively, shooting well from the outside, breaking out in transition, or create a bucket for himself in mismatches. Defensively, Brown isn‘t Marcus Smart, but he’s more than capable of guarding his position onthe ball, and his athleticism means he can match up against both guards and forwards credibly. If there’s anything holding him back, it’s that Brown’s offensive repertoire lacks a little bit of flair. This isn’t an insult, but the limits to Brown’s game stand out when compared to a couple of his top-flight teammates. Though he may not have a devastating stepback or consistently collapse the defense, Brown, from the moment he entered the league, has been a significant catalyst for Boston’s consistent success. — R.N37. De’Aaron Fox, Sacramento KingsDespite being just 22 years old and having never played in a playoff game, Fox appears well suited as the future of the Kings’ franchise. He signed a five-year extension, reportedly worth at least $163 million, this offseason to solidify his future with the club. Fox saw his scoring increase to 21.1 points per game last year and he shot a career-best 48% from the field. Kings coach Luke Walton appeared almost too comfortable with Fox orchestrating Sacramento’s offense, considering Fox totaled more than 80 touches per game, averaging 5.26 seconds per touch, more than Chris Paul, Kemba Walker or LeBron James. The addition of draft pick Tyrese Haliburton should help reduce Fox’s workload in a positive way. While Fox is a blur in transition, he’ll need to work on his three-point shot to ascend into the top echelon of NBA guards, as he shot just 29.2% per game from deep last year on just 3.6 attempts. He has improved in each of his three NBA seasons, and despite playing in a crowded Western Conference, the Kings are banking on the Kentucky product to lead them to their first postseason appearance since 2006. — B.P36. Brandon Ingram, New Orleans PelicansBrandon Ingram came to New Orleans as the jewel of the Anthony Davis trade, but at the time he was anything but a sure bet. Ingram paired an impressive isolation arsenal with frustrating shot selection in Los Angeles, generating far fewer threes and free throws than are necessary for a player with his skill set. His final season with the Lakers represented a step in the right direction. Year 1 in New Orleans was a revelation. Ingram won Most Improved Player and turned in a relatively dominant offensive season. He scored 23.8 points per game on a markedly improved 39.1% from three, posting the same effective field goal percentage as Luka Dončić. Ingram’s free-throw rate continues to trend upward. His three-point rate has skyrocketed. He receives plenty of isolation opportunities in New Orleans, and while Zion Williamson should earn a greater share of volume in 2020–21, the two franchise cornerstones appear to be complementary cogs. Expect continued growth in Ingram’s second year with the Pelicans. —M.S.Steve Dykes/USA TODAY Sports35. CJ McCollum, Portland Trail BlazersWhile Damian Lillard provides most of the fireworks in the Blazers’ offense, McCollum remains an indispensable metronome. McCollum’s steady scoring punch is somewhat jarring from a statistical perspective: he’s averaged between 20 and 23 points per game in each of the last five seasons, shooting between 44% and 48% from the field. The statistical profile makes sense, as McCollum’s game isn’t dependent on his athleticism or lift on a given night. He sports a deep array of tricks off the dribble, leaning on shot fakes, spin moves and crossovers to create the necessary separation between himself and a defender. McCollum doesn’t sport the scoring punch of a true leading man, and his 6' 3\" frame still creates defensive issues next to Lillard. But Portland’s second banana remains a quality one, having helped drive the Blazers to the playoffs in each of his seven seasons. —M.S.34. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsDraymond Green played in only 43 games last season, averaging the fewest minutes per game of his career since his second season in the league. With the Warriors beset by injuries to the Splash Brothers, a restrained hand with Green made sense. Golden State was going nowhere in 2020 even with Draymond at his best, so trying to preserve his legs for the future was the right call. And speaking of Draymond at his best, placed alongside the right talent, Green is still one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA. He can defend all over the floor. He’s an able and willing playmaker. He can lead a fast break. And his intelligence reeks of years of Finals experience, which means he’s militant about making the right basketball play at every juncture. The issue for Green is how much longer his body can hold up. The Draymond of the Death Lineup—when he played center and helped unlock probably the best five-man group in NBA history—doesn’t exist in the same way. Green can still reach those heights of tenacious defense and textbook rotations/switches, but doing it night in and night out for every minute he’s on the floor is no longer realistic. The Warriors as a whole seem to be feeling the effects of their five straight Finals trips. Stephen Curry missed functionally all of last season. Klay Thompson will miss a second straight season after tearing his ACL. Green was never as great as those two players at their height, which means even a little slippage in his game affects him much more significantly. Draymond has always been able to compensate for his shooting struggles, for example, by playing some of the best defense in the league. Ideally, the relative lack of stress of last season and the long layoff will give Green enough of an energy boost to look more like the 2016 vintage as the Warriors try to get back on track. — R.N33. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio SpursThere is an ageless quality to the way Aldridge plays basketball. Despite teams’ knowing the core tenets of Aldridge’s game, he is still effective night in and night out. Aldridge has been a stabilizing force in his five years with the Spurs, three of which earned him All-Star appearances. He averaged 18.9 points last year on 49.3% shooting, grabbing 7.4 rebounds per game. And he remains a force in the post, recording the second most post-up touches in the league and shooting 47.3% on his field goal attempts from that area. But despite being largely a known commodity, Aldridge showcased a new skill last year, shooting three three-pointers per game, the most of his career, and finishing the year with a 39.3% mark from behind the arc. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich recently stressed the importance of Aldridge’s improved three-point shooting, saying that Aldridge has worked throughout the summer and into the fall on his perimeter shooting and “is committed to taking another huge step” in that category. It should help him age gracefully. In a contract year at age 35, Aldridge will look to continue meshing with San Antonio’s young guards and serving as a strong pick-and-roll partner with fellow veteran DeMar Derozan. In a Western Conference rich with talent, Aldridge’s ability to help shape San Antonio’s offense will be an important factor in determining if the Spurs can reach the postseason. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated32. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansIt’s still mind-blowing that Zion Williamson has managed to live up to just about every aspect of his considerable hype: In the 19 games he played before the bubble, he was averaging 35.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per 100 possessions while often being deployed in short spurts, and the Pelicans performed like a top-half, playoff-caliber team on both sides of the floor. Williamson did all this without ever being in peak athletic shape—there’s endless debate over his health and playing weight, but he was inarguably more explosive at Duke. That manifested in a similarly effective, but more ground-bound play style, as well some pronounced defensive struggles as he played conceptual catch-up. Still, speculate all you want about the longevity of his body type, but you cannot argue with the results. When he was active, he was New Orleans’s best player. Williamson is a remarkable finisher around the basket, somehow unfettered by any and all comers, with an astute left hand and a multiple-jump explosiveness under the rim previously unseen in a player his size. He’s a smart passer and decision-maker who’s always been able to maximize his impact without having his number called, allowing him to, in theory, pair comfortably with a second scorer within a winning construct. Provided Williamson can work his way toward a physical peak, the surprising diversity of his game should manifest, and the Pelicans will do everything to showcase it. Instead of worrying what he could become, it’s better to save the clichés and just appreciate what’s already happening. —J.W.31. Kemba Walker, Boston CelticsThere are moments when Kemba Walker ascends to a plane of unstoppability that are absolutely thrilling to watch. Walker may not have the explosive or flashy quality to his game like some of his point guard contemporaries, and yet he still has periods of sublime scoring that leave defenders helpless. Those stretches when Walker gets going in the high pick-and-roll, pulling up on bigs who dare go under screens or driving by those who get a little too eager, are very satisfying to watch. Even with Jayson Tatum earning plaudits as Boston’s lead dog, there are moments when Walker looks like the best scorer on the team. Kemba has found a good home in Boston, where he doesn’t have the burden of being the No. 1 but can command the offense when necessary. He’s a high-volume, high-efficiency three-point shooter, and the stepback, midrange J is still as pretty as it was at Connecticut nearly 10 years ago. Of course, there are concerns. Walker experienced knee issues last season that will also cause him to miss the start of this one. His size makes him a frequent target on defense, and calls into question how effective he can really be in an ultra high-stakes playoff game. Knee, size, and defense problems are usually not kind to 30-year-old point guards, especially ones on max contracts. But those moments, people. When he does return to play, Walker is going to have one, two, three, however many of those nights when the ball can’t help to go in, like when he dropped 40 on the No. 1 Bucks last season, or 44 on the Pacers. Walker’s game isn’t as memeable as pull-ups from halfcourt. Don’t let that stop you from enjoying someone who is still a masterful bucket getter. — R.N30. Pascal Siakam, Toronto RaptorsThe honeymoon wasn’t quite as sweet for Siakam, who hit a wall without Kawhi Leonard during Toronto’s seven-game Eastern Conference semifinals loss against the Celtics. Siakam, who made his first All-Star team last February, averaged fewer than 15 points on less than 40% shooting and often looked overmatched as the Raptors’ lead playmaker. Still, over a larger sample size during the regular season, Siakam displayed significant improvement and did appear to be a potential franchise star. His scoring jumped from 16.9 points to 22.9 points per game in the regular season, and he made improvements in his three-point shooting. “I had to shoot [threes] in the NBA and I didn’t have to shoot them in college,” Siakam told Sports Illustrated’s Chris Mannix last fall. “I think that’s a big difference.” Siakam will continue working on his outside shot as he looks to develop a more well-rounded game. He is a versatile defender and pairs nicely with OG Anunoby on the wing. Now in his second season in more of a leadership role with the Raptors, Siakam will look to keep building on his upward trajectory. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated29. Trae Young, Atlanta HawksYoung flashed his prodigious scoring talent as a rookie, but he often looked overmatched amid a concerning amount of turnovers and a shaky shooting percentage. Year 2 was far more encouraging. Atlanta’s point guard finished fourth in scoring at 29.6 points per game in 2019–20, and perhaps more importantly, he turned in a far more efficient season. Young rose from 32% to 36.1% from three even with a leap in attempts, and he improved his effective field goal percentage by a marked margin. Young’s vision is truly elite in the half-court. He’s evolving as a pick-and-roll ballhandler. And even in a shaky situation, Young still managed to turn in an elite offensive season for a player of his age.Young’s 30-foot bombs create an obvious comparison to Steph Curry, but the conflation can be a little misplaced. Curry is one of the best off-ball shooters of all-time, wreaking havoc on defenses as he darts around screens and resets his position after a pass. Young’s approach, at this stage of his career, is more statuesque. He attempted just 105 spot-up threes last season, the same amount as Frank Ntilikina and (interestingly) James Harden. Young doesn’t make any marked impact without the ball in his hands. He turns the ball over at a higher rate than Curry ever did, and while Steph isn’t earning All-Defense honors anytime soon, Young remains a sieve by comparison.Despite his flaws, Young is a legitimately thrilling offensive talent, and he’ll inherit the best roster he’s had yet. Further refinement from Young on both ends of the ball in his third year could launch him into the league’s elite. Right now, despite his gaudy stats, he’s still outside All-NBA consideration. —M.S.28. Kyle Lowry, Toronto RaptorsIn the immediate aftermath of Kawhi Leonard’s departure, there were questions about what direction the Raptors would take. Would Masai Ujiri start tearing down the team and trade away his veterans? Instead, Ujiri put all speculation to rest when he signed franchise icon Kyle Lowry to a one-year extension last October. With the understanding Toronto planned to vigorously defend its title, Lowry had a remarkable 2020. The 34-year-old averaged 19.4 points per game last season, the second-best mark on the club and his most since 2017. Even at his advanced age and with years of playoff runs on his body, Lowry remains one of the most impactful guards in the game.He does everything you want. Pull-up and spot-up threes. An ability to draw fouls. (Fun fact: Lowry’s free-throw rate last season was the fourth-best of his career and highest since 2009.) Aggressive defense. But most of all, while his critics and opponents may find him to be a nuisance, Lowry is one of the most intelligent players in the game. He can seemingly leverage any situation to his benefit. Often that means trying to find a foul at any cost, but there’s also no question Lowry is willing to put his body on the line in a way few people of his age and size are willing to do on such a consistent basis. Toronto was a legitimate contender last year, and Lowry, with his wit, guile, and skill, was the biggest reason why. At 34, it is fair to wonder how much longer Lowry can keep this up. His style of play takes a physical toll. But with the emergence of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, the Raptors are hoping to lighten his burden. If this season does end up signaling a shift in Toronto, any team that takes itself seriously would welcome Lowry with open arms. — R.N27. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee BucksWhile Giannis Antetokounmpo has been at the center of the Bucks’ success in recent years, Khris Middleton has been an integral part of the franchise’s rise unto himself. He’s made the All-Star team in each of the past two years and has shown gradual improvement throughout his career, leading up to career highs in points (20.9), rebounds (6.2) and field goal percentage (49.7) per game last season. The former second-round pick also provides the Bucks with flexibility on the defensive end and is versatile enough to guard at least three positions. While a number of Bucks have put up underwhelming playoff numbers in recent years, Middleton has also been a consistent postseason performer, even upping his scoring average by three points per game in 2019–20. The addition of Jrue Holiday should also provide even more flexibility, as the Bucks’ newly formed star trio looks to lead the franchise to its first title since 1970–71. —B.P26. Jrue Holiday, Milwaukee Bucks Quantifying a player’s true worth defensively can be challenging, but the near-unanimous respect Jrue Holiday has earned from opponents going on the better part of a decade speaks for itself. His unique ability to make opponents uncomfortable, working them quietly off their line to the rim, taking away personal space without fouling, and bending but rarely breaking, has become something of a lost art. Holiday defends guards, wings and even bigs without flinching, his combination of strength and quickness at 6’4” proving unusually functional over the years. He stops the ball, he plays the passing lanes, he’ll switch onto anyone and he understands better than any guard in the league how to leverage his size against taller players. As Holiday’s final season with the Pelicans often demonstrated, no player alone can make a defense great. But the massive haul of future draft picks the Bucks surrendered for him had as much to do with Holiday’s lofty status as it did Milwaukee’s urgency. While Holiday is not a point guard by nature, he can moonlight on the ball effectively and grab and go off the defensive glass. He’s not an elite jump shooter, but he commands respect on the catch. Few players have the energy or wherewithal to provide elite defense as a constant, and accentuating it with a viable, high-usage role on the other end. Holiday still finds time to stuff the stat sheet. It’s hard to put a price on the type of creative optionality a player like that can afford his coach. His shooting percentages ticked down after the Pelicans traded Anthony Davis and should benefit in much the same way when flanking Giannis Antetokounmpo. Holiday remains as well-rounded a secondary star as you’ll find anywhere in the league, and time and again, he proves it. —J.W.25. Russell Westbrook, Washington WizardsSo what should we make of Westbrook after 12 seasons, nine All-Star teams, one MVP and (roughly) a million hot takes? Will we see the Westbrook of the NBA bubble, where he limped through the postseason as his Houston tenure ended in disaster? Or will Westbrook quickly return to form with his third franchise, reminding us all just how physically dominant he can be? There’s reason to bet on the latter. Westbrook was downright dominant for a significant stretch in 2019–20. He averaged 32.9 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in his final 20 contests before the season’s hiatus, carrying Houston’s offense as James Harden struggled through an extended shooting slump. Westbrook remains a lethal force at the rim and in transition. He’s an impactful cutter when he wants to be, and he quietly turned in the most efficient season of his career in 2019–20. Vintage Westbrook was arguably the best athlete in NBA history. The current version is still close to the top of the league.Still, the flaws are more obvious than ever with Westbrook. His jump shot oscillates between middling and broken depending on the week, and his stubbornness regarding said jumper can create plenty of frustration. Acquiring Westbrook means you get the whole package. He’ll bring his maniacal work ethic and competitiveness to each stop. A culture of accountability will be established. But with those benefits comes a certain cost. Houston nearly blew its first-round series against Oklahoma City as Westbrook domineered the action. A strong stretch in 2020–21 could carry the Wizards to the postseason. But in a given series, Westbrook’s shortcomings can sink his team. —M.S.24. Devin Booker, Phoenix SunsThe Phoenix Suns dug themselves a sizable hole before the league stopped play in mid-March and so, despite an 8–0 seeding game run in the NBA bubble, the Suns missed the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season. But Booker nearly willed his way to the postseason, averaging 30.5 points per game on 50.3% shooting in Orlando. A proven bucket getter, Booker averaged 26.6 points per game for the second straight year, leading the Suns in scoring yet again. While Booker is always a threat from the perimeter, his numbers from deep are also statistically underwhelming, at least by his standards, with him shooting just 35.4% from three, though the difficulty of his attempts has something to do with it. Phoenix’s trade for All-Star guard Chris Paul will surely help Booker find more space on offense. Still just 24 years old, Booker will look to continue his ascension into the league’s upper echelon of guards this season, as the franchise eyes a playoff berth. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated23. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz The game continues to slow down ever so slightly for Mitchell, who is refining his naturally helter-skelter approach to scoring and coming off the best season of his young career, managing a 55.8% true shooting clip on 30.8% usage, making his first All-Star team and taking a major step toward All-NBA status. Mitchell announced himself in full over the course of an epic series against the Nuggets, trading blows with Jamal Murray, dropping two 50-point games, and pushing Denver to seven games, over the course of which he converted 53% of his twos, 51% of his threes, 94% of his free throws and averaged 36 points. He’s a challenge to keep out of the paint and gets separation for himself on the perimeter, and he does all that while still playing defense, standing 6' 1\" and never seeming to relent.Of course, Mitchell may never match that impossible hot streak again. But he’s ascended the ranks of the league’s most potent scorers for a reason, and there’s plenty more for him to accomplish. If he settles for fewer floaters and uses his explosiveness to put more pressure on the basket, he’ll surely get to the free throw line more than four or five times per game. Mitchell draws plenty of defensive attention and can become a better creator for his teammates during his frequent forays into traffic. Becoming less ball-dominant might lead to more catch-and-shoot looks and another uptick in his percentages. He’s only 24, and it’s all on the table. But Mitchell doesn’t have to do any of those things to be one of the toughest nightly covers in the league. And that’s the scary part. —J.W.22.  Jamal Murray, Denver NuggetsClearly enough, the Nuggets’ magical postseason run—which saw the franchise overcome two 3–1 series deficits—would not have happened without Murray’s stellar play. While many of Murray’s regular-season averages were nearly identical in 2018–19 and 2019–20, the Canadian guard’s scoring jumped eight points per contest in last year’s postseason. He scored 30 or more points in six of Denver’s 19 playoff games, putting up multiple 40- and 50-point showings, and also averaged nearly two more assists per contest. When the 23-year-old Murray agreed to a five-year, $170 million extension in the summer of 2019, some questioned Denver’s decision to anoint Murray as a franchise centerpiece despite his having never made an All-Star team. Now, such doubts appear moot, as Murray enters the 2020–21 campaign poised to build on his stellar playoff run. Alongside two-time All-Star Nikola Jokić and a series of promising role players, it seems as if Murray and the Nuggets will only continue to rise. “We have two superstars in Nikola and Jamal,” head coach Mike Malone said this past September. “And a lot of other really good, young talented players behind them.” —B.P.21. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ersSneer at Simmons’s three-point phobia if you wish, but Philadelphia’s point guard remains one of the game’s most electric guards. Simmons is an absolute force in transition, bullying his way to the rim with a combination of size and speed unmatched throughout the league. The LSU product thrives off of turnovers, and he increasingly leans on his athletic gifts to generate free points for Philadelphia. Simmons won the steals title last season en route to his first All-Defense selection. He paired his ball-hawking skills with improved rotational awareness, anchoring Philadelphia’s defense. For all his half-court shortcomings, Simmons’s transition prowess and defensive dominance makes him one of the Eastern Conference’s most valuable players.Simmons sports the athletic profile to be a top-10 player. But the flaws in his game grow increasingly frustrating by the season. It’s not just that Simmons is a poor shooter. It’s that he’s an unwilling one. Philadelphia’s point guard attempted just seven threes in 2019–20. He attempted 16 midrange jumpers. Perhaps Simmons’s stylistic deficiencies would be acceptable if he were flanked by a cadre of shooters, but given his big-man costar, the lack of any discernible jumper can be downright untenable. Even extending his range past the free-throw line would do wonders for Philadelphia, further unlocking the two-man game between Simmons and Embiid. Perhaps Simmons will show some growth in 2020-21. If not, he’ll remain a tantalizing, yet frustrating talent on the fringe of the All-NBA discussion. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated20. Bam Adebayo, Miami HeatSeemingly once a game, an opposing perimeter player will make the mistake of thinking they have a mismatch against Bam Adebayo. Catching Adebayo in a switch, said perimeter player often calls for an isolation and then tries to blow by Bam to the rim. And sure enough, once a game, that player learns they’ve made a terrible mistake as they quickly realize they have nowhere to go. Adebayo is one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA, and he’s the crown jewel of the Heat’s future. Jimmy Butler often refers to him as the team’s best player, and that refrain may be more than just modesty.Bam’s footwork and intelligence belie his age. At 23, he should already be a consistent candidate for Defensive Player of the Year. He can truly guard any position on the floor, banging with beefy centers or staying in front of speedy guards. His block on Jayson Tatum at the end of Game 1 of the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals was not only picture perfect, it told the story of how special Adebayo is. He wasn’t guarding Tatum on that play—but Adebayo timed his release from his own man to be in perfect help position on Tatum, he had the athleticism to meet him at the rim, and then the awareness to keep the ball in bounds and in Miami’s possession. On the other end of the floor, Adebayo is a fulcrum in the Heat’s motion attack. He’s a deft passer, and Erik Spoelstra often relies on him in lieu of a playmaking point guard to direct the offense. Bam is deadly on handoffs, and his jumper is steadily improving. After mostly being a rim runner his first two seasons in the league, Adebayo morphed into an elbow traffic cop in 2020, ultimately averaging 15.9 ponts, 10.2 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. And he has the potential to be so much more. Just ask the Celtics again, who saw their season ended by Adebayo’s 32 points in Game 6 of the East Finals, including when he went on a run by himself in the fourth quarter, stunning Boston with a flurry of offensive moves to send them packing. Bam is No. 20 on this list, but he’s really just getting started. — R.N19. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn NetsThere always seems to be some form of discontent surrounding Kyrie Irving, who holds the crown as the NBA’s most mercurial superstar. Irving’s tenure in Cleveland ended with a trade demand. He exited Boston after a tumultuous two seasons, and his first year with Brooklyn featured its own share of controversy. But perhaps we’re focusing too much on questions surrounding Irving’s peculiar personality. Brooklyn’s point guard remains one of the game’s top scorers, and, paired with Kevin Durant, it’s possible we’ll see him hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy in 2021. Harp on the backpage headlines if you’d like. Doing so ignores Irving’s immense talent. There are few guards in league history as purely gifted as the 2016 champion.Irving’s sheer statistical resume in recent seasons shouldn’t go unnoticed. He’s one of two players (along with Steph Curry) to average more than 24 points per game while shooting over 40% from three in the last four seasons, and 2019–20 featured Irving’s most impressive offensive campaign. The Duke product averaged 27.4 points per game with a 54.6 effective field goal percentage, scoring 1.06 points per isolation possession. Irving is perhaps the most malleable offensive point guard in today’s game. He’s a dominant force with the ball in his hands, sporting the league’s deepest bag of tricks off the dribble. Irving is also a dangerous off-ball spacer, likely making him a perfect complement to Durant in 2020–21. Irving’s defensive shortcomings are notable. He’s not the warmest personality by most accounts. Yet there’s no denying his historic talent. Don’t be surprised if we see Irving dicing up defenses late into the 2020–21 postseason. —M.S.18. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota TimberwolvesThere isn’t much that the Timberwolves star can’t do, especially on the offensive end of the floor. Towns averaged a career-high 26.5 points last season, while shooting 50.8% from the field. He was an impact player in the post and a top player at any position from beyond the arc, shooting 42.5% from behind the arc on his 5.9 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per contest. But on the defensive side of the floor, the Wolves struggled last season, finishing as a bottom-third unit, with Towns playing in just 35 games. His own defensive concerns remain as pronounced as ever. Towns will look to mesh with D’Angelo Russell, who is beginning his first full season with the franchise, and top pick Anthony Edwards. The Wolves have surrounded Towns with a number of talented pieces, and the hope is that this season will offer a better gauge of where the franchise stands. — B.P.Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports17. Jayson Tatum, Boston CelticsNo one in the NBA made as significant a leap as Jayson Tatum did in 2020, when he went from promising young gun to “Oh my god, this kid is about to be a superstar.” The 22-year-old was sublime for the Celtics last season, leading the team in scoring despite sharing the ball with vets like Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward. Tatum was bonkers, averaging 23.4 points, 3.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds per game. He shot a comical 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts a night, turning his stepback jumper into one of the most lethal shots in the Association.Tatum has the talent to be a scoring leader one day. He can get a bucket from the outside, from the midrange, or by making his way to the rim for a finish or foul. Few guys this early in their career are supposed to have such a layered offensive game, but Tatum plays with the smoothness of a 10-year-vet. His three-point shooting was particularly notable after complaints about him settling for too many long twos in 2019. Tatum bumped up his efficiency last season, and what’s frightening for opponents is how he should only improve from here. Defensively, Tatum isn’t a lockdown guy, but he doesn’t cheat on that end of the floor, and he’s a key part of Boston’s elite unit. Tatum is dripping with polish and yet he’s so far away from his prime. He has many offseasons to tinker with his game. Maybe he wants to add more to his post catalogue. Or maybe he wants to perfect a baseline turnaround. With so many skills already in his arsenal, Tatum is building on a foundation much more advanced than a typical third-year player. And he has the prototypical size—6’ 8”, 210 pounds—to become one of the league’s dominant wings. The Tatum era in Boston is quite young, but he’s already been a key contributor on two trips to the conference finals in only three seasons. It would almost be shocking if Tatum didn’t bring Boston back to the Finals sooner rather than later. — R.N16. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz Employing the NBA’s top defensive center affords a certain degree of stylistic comfort: Over Gobert’s six seasons as a full-time fixture in Utah’s lineup, the Jazz have finished first, second, first, second, fourth and ninth in points allowed per game, often employing a plodding pace and making the playoffs in five of those years. Utah’s performance in the postseason has been a different story—draw the wrong opponent, and the 7' 1\" Gobert can look out of his depth rather quickly—but we’re talking about a two-time Defensive Player of the Year who’s made first-team All-Defense in four straight seasons. Indisputably, Gobert remains the best rim defender in basketball, he rebounds at an elite clip on both ends, he’s proved relatively durable for someone his size and he’s a puzzle opponents are forced to solve every night.Like an expert center back or rangy middle linebacker, Gobert forces an offense to simply maneuver its way around him, or avoid him entirely. It’s not so much as the shots he blocks anymore as the angles he takes away, and he’s disciplined, averaging just 3.3 fouls per 36 minutes. As with any 7-footer, some physical decline is eventually in the cards, but at age 28, Gobert remains a tad more mobile than you think, his length proving a great equalizer in changing angles and effecting shots when he’s forced to defend in space. Remember that when the Jazz have gone down in the playoffs, it’s been at the hands of elite offensive talents: James Harden, Stephen Curry and, last year, an ascendant Jamal Murray. They’re guards who can expertly manipulate ball-screen coverages and need just a sliver of space to launch deadeye threes. Lest we forget, most teams don’t have a player like that and have to simply deal with the massive, intelligent man walling off the paint as best they can. As Gobert enters a contract year, Utah will lean on him as long as it’s feasible. —J.W.15. Bradley Beal, Washington WizardsIn Year 8 of a still-underappreciated career, Beal stretched his game to its limits and walked away with another notch in his belt, averaging a career-high 30.6 points without sacrificing much in the way of efficiency. And he did so as the primary focus of nearly every defense he faced. He shot worse from the field on the whole with the added workload, but made it to the foul line more often and averaged a career-high in assists as the top playmaker in a transition year. He’s been perhaps the NBA’s most durable star, racking up minutes without complaint. He took a real leap in the absence of John Wall, and now the Wizards are betting on Beal’s unusual malleability as a viable fit with Russell Westbrook. He remains an elite catch-and-shoot player and could easily inch close to his old neighborhood of 40% from distance if all goes well. There simply aren’t many holes in Beal’s offensive game, with equal capacity on and off the ball, off the catch or using a screen. As the Wizards continue to bat away trade offers and build around Beal, the prospect of his game continuing to improve points to why Washington would hold. Having Westbrook around, you’d hope, will reduce Beal’s creation duties, allow him cleaner looks as a play finisher and improve his results all over the floor. If he takes all he’s learned and demonstrated over the past two years, acquiesces a tad to his new teammate and stays just as effective, Beal could conceivably repeat his 30-point campaign with less exertion, and perhaps more wins for his team. There are players on this list who are more prolific, but few as consistent and reliable. —J.W.14. Chris Paul, Phoenix SunsEverywhere Chris Paul goes, winning follows. In case that wasn’t obvious, the 2020 Thunder are a shining example. After reviving the Clippers and nearly bringing the Rockets to the Finals, CP was unceremoniously shipped to Oklahoma City in the summer of 2019. Instead of trying to force his way out to a contender, Paul, who turned 35 in May, went to work and put together one of the finest individual seasons of his career. CP averaged 17.6 points, 5.0 assists, and 6.7 rebounds per game for the Thunder, while shooting 48.9% from the field. The only other players in the league to average that many points, assists, and rebounds per game while shooting at least 48% from the field last season were LeBron James and Nikola Jokic. That’s how incredible Paul was, all while being a clutch-time assassin for a team that was a Lu Dort three away from upsetting the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Paul looked rejuvenated in OKC. Not only did he relish the role of playing point guard again, he told SI in December 2019 his body felt transformed after changing his diet and workout regimen after the trade from Houston. Paul now only eats plant-based meals, and hired a new trainer after injuries zapped some of his effectiveness as James Harden’s running mate. If those lifestyle changes are long lasting, then the Suns should be a legitimate force this season. So much of the conversation around Paul is about his large contract—and how he will definitely not opt out of the last year of his deal to give himself more flexibility. Well, CP was worth every penny in 2020. Count out the Point God at your own risk. — R.NKelvin Kuo/USA Today Sports13. Paul George, Los Angeles ClippersIt’s become almost impossible to separate the short-term playoff conversation around Paul George from who he really is as a player. Did George struggle during the Clippers inexcusable seven-game loss in the bubble to the Nuggets? Yes. Was the front office smart to sign him to an extension this summer? Absolutely. PG is far from a scrub. Let’s put that to bed right now. He was an MVP candidate in 2019 before hurting his shoulder. And he was carrying that Thunder team that also included Russell Westbrook. George remains an All-NBA caliber defender with an offensive game that’s expertly suited for the modern game. Once healthy, George was exactly what the Clippers needed last season. A deadly second option who could create for himself when called upon while being an absolute sniper from three. PG looked completely recovered from his shoulder troubles with the Clips, shooting a career-high 41.2% from beyond the arc. If anything, L.A. was too cautious with George, playing him only 29.6 minutes a night in the regular season, his fewest since his rookie year (excluding the 2015 season when he played in only six games off the bench after breaking his leg.) While George may fall short of being the true No.1 on a championship contender, it would be asinine to cast him aside as some kind of punchline. He has a recent history of some postseason foibles. He also once impressed LeBron so much that James dapped him in the middle of a playoff game between two heated rivals. At 30 years old, George isn’t an up-and-comer, but he still has time to rewrite the book on the kind of player he is in high-stakes moments. For someone with so much talent, the story is far from over. — R.N12. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail BlazersPerhaps to nobody’s shock, Lillard was the league’s most prolific player in the run-up to last year’s postseason. With a number of eye-catching performances, Lillard led Portland from outside the Western Conference’s playoff picture to the No. 8 seed, a run required after injuries plagued the Blazers throughout the regular season. Overall, Lillard averaged career highs in points (30) and assists (8) per game, while shooting 40.1% from three. He is also currently the league’s best long-range three-point shooter, taking 6.8 attempts from 25 to 29 feet last year and shooting 40% on them. Throughout the offseason, Portland made a number of key acquisitions, bringing in versatile forwards Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr., and center Enes Kanter. The team also re-signed forwards Carmelo Anthony and Rodney Hood. Lillard recently said that his message to team president Neil Olshey was: “Let’s go for it.” The Blazers are just one full season removed from making the Western Conference finals, and it appears as if another berth in the league’s final four is fully possible, especially if Lillard shows even more improvement this season. —B.P.11. Jimmy Butler, Miami HeatThe most interesting man in the NBA, Jimmy Butler found the perfect home for himself in Miami, where the Heat welcomed his aggressive playing style en route to a shocking Finals berth. In the process, Butler outplayed two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the second round of the postseason, and then with his two best teammates (Adebayo and Dragic) injured, he frankly single-handedly took two games off the Lakers in the championship round. Though he had some big nights in the playoffs—including his iconic 40-point triple double in Game 3 of the Finals—Butler wasn’t asked to be a traditional scorer for Miami in 2020. He averaged a modest-for-a-perimeter-star 19.9 points a game during the regular season, but he compensated by adding 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds a night, both career-bests. Butler showed a knack for controlling the game when the Heat needed him to the most. With a shaky jump shot, he turned in a Harden-esque 9.1 free-throw attempts a game, willing himself to the line whenever his team needed a bucket throughout the season. For all his past escapades, Butler was measured his first season in Miami, picking his spots offensively while playing his typical stellar defense on whoever was in front of him. (And for what it’s worth, the only other players with at least a 19.5-6.5-6.0 statline with better than 45% shooting were Luka, LeBron, Russ, and Jokic.)What Butler proved during the Heat’s surprise run through the East is that he can be the No. 1 player on a championship contender. Few players—even some above Butler on this list—can confidently make that claim. If there are any concerns, it’s that at 31-years-old, Butler is no spring chicken. His jump shot is a valid issue. And for all the leadership he brings, he’s not going to put up the numbers of an MVP candidate.Still, when the stakes were at their absolute highest, Butler delivered. And he did so with aplomb, flashing playmaking, defense, rebounding, and of course scoring in the Finals, giving LeBron a legitimate run for his money. Some people are already calling Miami’s playoff run a fluke. As for Butler? He told SI he has something up his sleeve for next season. And only it’s getting harder to doubt Butler’s will.10. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ersFew bigs, if any, are currently as dominant as the 76ers center. Embiid bullies smaller defenders and is too skilled for those who might be a closer physical comparison. Around the rim, he is a foul-drawing machine and additionally led the league in post-up points with 7.4 per game. Embiid also provides the Sixers with a consistent bail-out option, having taken the most field goal attempts per game with between zero and four seconds on the shot clock last season, making 41.5% of them. While Embiid saw a number of his counting stats decrease this past season, he’s poised for an uptick alongside a revised core that now features a number of sharpshooters, with the Sixers’ notably adding Danny Green and Seth Curry in trades this offseason, hoping to free up more space for Embiid around the basket. While durability remains a concern for the 26-year-old center, Embiid could very well be the best big in basketball. Don’t be surprised if he leads the Sixers toward a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference and a deep postseason run. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated9. Luka Dončić, Dallas MavericksThere’s an abundance of ways to contextualize the incredible things Luka Dončić has accomplished by age 21. Suffice it to say, there’s a high likelihood what we’re witnessing is the emergence of the NBA’s next true alpha talent, and a player who could conceivably be in contention for the No. 1 spot on this list a year from now. He lands ninth on our list out of respect to the players ahead of him, but Dončić is closing in quickly, and, truthfully, you could make a compelling case for ranking him as high as fourth or fifth. At this point, it’s a matter of preference, a testament to the speed and manner in which he’s captured the attention and respect of his peers, and his savant-level capacity to control, and increasingly, take over the flow of a given game. It takes a truly unusual combination of focus and skill to function comfortably at the intersection of high usage and high efficiency, and it’s a challenge most players never master. Dončić is already there.In just his second NBA season, Dončić averaged 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists, made first-team All-NBA and the All-Star team, finished fourth in MVP voting and was the focal point of the most efficient NBA offense ever recorded. In two years, he’s worked his way up to 18th on the all-time triple-double list, having passed players including Draymond Green, Kobe Bryant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If there’s a legitimate knock on him right now, it’s his 31.6% three-point clip, stemming from degree-of-difficulty attempts that defenses will often live with (conversely, he converted 57% of attempts inside the arc). But Dončić is a fearless enough shooter that you can’t leave him open, and his floor game is otherwise a challenge to pick apart, considering his exceptional passing skills and unselfish nature (he also finished third in assists per game). He’s not fleet of foot, but his sheer size helps protect him defensively. He looked capable of pushing the Clippers to the brink in the playoffs, before injuries, fatigue and bad luck derailed the Mavericks.The scary part here, of course, is how much time Doncic has to keep adjusting and improving, with the rest of the league throwing the book at him in the meantime. At this early stage of his career, everything is seemingly within his reach. What’s crystal clear is that his superstardom is concrete, and that there’s assuredly more to come. —J.W.8. Nikola Jokić, Denver NuggetsThe steady evolution of Nikola Jokić has been one of the NBA’s most delightful story lines in recent years. The Serbian center was the subject of fascination early in his career, showing flashes of brilliance despite his doughy frame. But as Jokić’s stature grew, so did the questions surrounding his long-term ceiling. Is he fit enough to survive extended playoff series? Can he command games as a scorer? Can you win with a center as your leading man in the modern era? Jokić has answered all those questions with relative ease. The 2019 playoffs served as the greatest affirmation of Jokić’s brilliance. He became the second player in NBA history to average 25 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in a single playoffs, and his 64-minute triple-double against the Blazers served as a watershed moment in his career. Jokić doesn’t necessarily look the part of a franchise anchor. But he remains one in every sense of the word.Jokić’s offensive brilliance is infectious. He’s arguably the greatest passing big of all time, averaging seven assists per game in each of the last two seasons. But it’s not necessarily the assist volume that sets Jokić apart. He dishes dimes from every conceivable angle, throwing looping passes to cutters and lasers to perimeter shooters. There’s a skittishness evident with defenses that play against Jokić. Take a step toward the paint, and an open three will be generated. Stay put on the perimeter, and Jokić is ready to punish a defender on the low block. Jokic isn’t just unselfish. He’s downright gleeful to feed his teammates. It’s hard to imagine a better superstar alongside Jamal Murray in Denver.Denver’s resident behemoth is more than just a transcendent passer. He’s evolved into a punishing presence at the rim, averaging a healthy 1.06 points per possession on postups and 1.03 points per possession as a roll man in 2019–20. Jokić can catch the ball in traffic and put it on the floor. He’s a gifted interior passer, and his midrange jumper is more refined by the year. Jokić occasionally suffers from what we’ll call Marc Gasol syndrome. He’ll pass up open triples in search of feeding his teammates, though that unselfishness can occasionally be counterproductive. Jokić isn’t a knock-down shooter, but his reticence appears to be hampering his percentages to a degree. Few players in the NBA sport better instincts on the floor. Jokic should be unafraid to let it fly. The more command of the offense he takes, the better. —M.S.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated7. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles LakersWhile LeBron James was the unquestioned No. 1 on the Lakers, Anthony Davis was the key to unlocking the team’s success. His versatility, particularly on the defensive end on the floor, essentially served as a cheat code for the Lakers’ coaching staff. Frank Vogel could play big, small, shooters, non-shooters. Seemingly none of it mattered because Davis’s game largely covered up for any perceived deficiencies elsewhere in the lineup. AD will be a bonafide Defensive Player of the Year candidate for many seasons to come. He shifted between power forward and center in 2020, and he was the ultimate eraser for the Lakers. Vogel could cook up aggressive schemes because Davis served as the ultimate backline defender, punishing those who dared to challenge him in the paint. The Lakers rarely relied on switching, and their stay-at-home mentality banked on the fact Davis could roam and wreak havoc when necessary. AD could also guard perimeter stars, like he did when he matched up with Jimmy Butler in the Finals, or Kawhi Leonard during the regular season. Only two or three players in the world right now are as impactful as Davis when he’s locked in on the defensive end, and frankly that skill alone makes him an incredibly valuable player.But of course, there’s the offensive component. James recently told SI the Lakers thought Davis was hardly breaking a sweat at times when putting up monster numbers. AD’s game is effortless on the surface, but the devil is in the details, particularly his footwork. He can abuse more lumbering bigs with turnarounds, jab steps, and quick bursts. He can bully smaller defenders on the block. He looked like Dirk Nowitzki at times with his midrange jumper during the postseason. And Davis also has the ability to stretch his game out to the three-point line, though he’s so effective from the elbow down it almost seems unfair when he’s also connecting from distance. Like many greats, Davis is obsessed with constantly adding flourishes to his game. He’s only 27 years old, which means the contract extension he recently inked will carry him through the smack dab of his prime. The players above Davis on this list have either been the No. 1 guy on a championship team or won MVP (or both.) The odds are AD will join that club sooner rather than later. — R.NWendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports6. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets All signs would seem to indicate that we’re getting something close to the full Durant experience this season. He’s far enough removed from his torn Achilles that expectations are running high. There’s certainly some hope built into this ranking, but we’re talking about one of the greatest scorers in league history, and a player whose size, skill and pure shooting ability give him a chance to age more than gracefully as he plays out his remaining prime years in Brooklyn. Durant is one of maybe a handful of players who are true threats to score the ball no matter where they stand on the floor nor how you choose to defend them. He’s always been able to simply shoot over you when he wants to, and he makes those shots most of the time. The magic lies in the consistency and inevitability of those points, particularly when games matter most. His decision to join the Warriors will always be controversial, but the results he got in Golden State should not be. Now, Durant’s time with the Nets—the third phase of his career—may prove to be the most complicated test he’s faced.So, what’s next? Durant has said he’ll spend time at center this season. Brooklyn’s apparent willingness to experiment, and his apparent lack of minutes restriction, bodes well for the state of his body. The truth is that he’s always transcended positions, because he’s seven feet tall and is probably going to score on whoever’s defending him. But the thought of him working more as a screener and the focal point of a five-out offense is certainly intriguing food for thought. As Durant continues to age, the value he brings defensively will continue to diminish. You might also see his playmaking skills and rebounding trend upward as his responsibilities change. Health is a serious caveat, but if we’re simply picking teams for this season, it’s hard to take Durant any lower than this. If he truly returns to form, this placement will look a little conservative. —J.W.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Stephen Curry, Golden State WarriorsFor some reason, there’s a section of NBA fans who want to shovel dirt on Stephen Curry. They think he needs to prove something this upcoming season, that he has to show he can still be a superstar-level player without Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant by his side. It’s blasphemous. Curry remains one of the most electric players in the NBA, and his shooting ability endures as one of the most impactful forces in league history.Curry played in only five games last season, but there’s no reason to believe he’s not fully recovered from the broken hand that caused him to miss most of the year. If anything, the long layoff should help Curry, whose body could have likely could have used a break after five straight Finals trips. Critics will point to Golden State’s early struggles in the first post-Durant year as evidence that Curry can’t be a traditional No. 1 guy. That strain of thought completely ignores the context of last year’s Warriors roster, which was hastily reassembled after Thompson’s ACL tear and Durant’s departure. Just because Curry doesn’t have the build, look, or style of a typical perimeter star doesn’t mean he’s any less effective. His gravity alone on the offensive side of the ball completely changes the calculus of any defense. For as great as players like LeBron, KD, or Kawhi are, when have you ever seen an opponent try to slow them down with a box-and-one? Curry is obviously a killer with the ball in his hands because he’s a threat to pull up at any moment, but his off-ball work—his cutting, screening, and constant motion—is just as beautiful to watch. Few stars of his caliber are committed to that style of play. And the attention he draws when he sets a proper screen makes life immeasurably easier for his teammates. Curry could score 15 points in a game and still be the reason for an elite offensive performance because of everything he does for his team. And for all the concerns about his defense, he continues to compensate for his relative lack of size by being in the right place at the right time and an engaged team defender. At 32, Curry may very well be nearing the end of his prime. Still, shooting often ages gracefully. And with all the chatter about his status as a No. 1 perhaps serving as extra motivation, Curry should be primed for at least one more great season. — R.N4. James Harden, Houston RocketsStrip away the aesthetic debate and a simple truth emerges regarding James Harden. Houston’s leading man is arguably the greatest scorer of the century, and at this point in his career, Harden remains a walking playoff berth. The 2017–18 MVP enters this season with 11 straight postseason appearances and three straight scoring titles, posting one of the most impressive scoring resumes in league history. Just three players have tallied more 40-point games. Harden could pass Kobe Bryant for the third-most 50-point performances this season, and he has a good shot of passing Michael Jordan for the No. 2 spot in the coming seasons. Harden does benefit from obscene volume, but can you really blame Houston for tailoring its offense to the Harden show? The past eight years have represented arguably the best stretch in franchise history thanks to Harden’s brilliance.It’s not necessarily the scoring totals that makes the Harden experience so jarring. It’s the way he’s completely warped defenses in recent seasons. His dominant step-back has forced opponents to shade their coverage to a hilarious degree, placing defenders firmly on his left hip to prevent the game’s most unstoppable move. When one defender fails, defenses opt for a new strategy entirely. The 2019–20 season brought the emergence of the Harden trap, in which teams would double-team Harden before he even stepped past half-court. Harden has a legitimate statistical case as the greatest scorer of this century. But the way he’s defended may be the greatest testament to his greatness. Just as Michael Jordan required his own unique coverage decades ago, opponents fully embraced the Harden Rules to a shocking degree in 2019–20.Harden’s offensive brilliance will earn him a bust in Springfield and potentially a statue in Houston when all is said and done. But will the Harden experience be remembered as much for its frustrations as its brilliance? Harden remains an imperfect player despite it all. He’s often unwilling to make any impact without the ball in his hands, far too content to rest with his hands on his hips in the half-court. Harden’s postseason failures have been noted ad nauseum, and while there is some context necessary, it’s hard to shake the feeling that there is a gear missing with the season on the line. Harden disappeared in a 2017 exit against San Antonio. He couldn’t stop the stream of missed triples vs. Golden State in 2018, and he was outdueled by Steph Curry down the stretch one year later. Perhaps Harden’s struggles are exacerbated by his unique style. Perhaps the talent around him is to blame. Regardless, Harden’s contention window in Houston appears to have come to a close. We’ll see if he can reverse his career narrative in a new location sooner than later. —M.S.3. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles ClippersOn any given night, Kawhi Leonard can be the best basketball player in the universe. Though his first year with the Clippers ultimately ended in massive disappointment, Leonard showed numerous times throughout 2020 why some had moved him ahead of LeBron before the season. Kawhi is a steely assassin, an expert at getting to his spots when he needs a bucket. He’s at his most enjoyable to watch when he puts teams away by himself, going on these mini flurries at the ends of halves, forcing opponents into submission with his unstoppable elbow jumper. Leonard is a master at playing on his schedule. He can lull you into a false sense of confidence because at first glance his style of play is not overwhelming. But once he finds a weakness to exploit, he is ruthless in his execution.With the Clips, Kawhi improved on the campaign that landed him a Finals MVP in Toronto. He averaged a career-best 27.1 points per game, shooting a robust 47% from the field and 37.8% from three. The defense remains suffocating when he wants it to be, even if Kawhi isn’t a pure stopper as he was early in his career. (Nobody with that much of an offensive burden really is.) Leonard also made great strides as a playmaker, recording a career-high 4.9 assists a night. Playing without a great point guard for really the first time in his career, the Clippers asked Leonard to be more of a ball-handler in 2020, and he acquitted himself well as a passer when drawing extra defenders. That added element to his game made the Clips really deadly when they had their full complement of players, as Kawhi was adept at finding his numerous shooters when needed. (If anything, the Clippers’ early playoff exit showed that Leonard could afford to be even more aggressive. Perhaps it’s not his preference, but he’s more than capable of running constant pick-and-rolls to exploit matchups.)Ultimately, there’s a reason why Leonard, before the age of 30, has gotten the best of guys like Durant, Steph, LeBron, and Giannis in the playoffs—it’s because he’s really damn good. All the players listed there have also had disappointing playoff losses, by the way. Don’t let what happened in the bubble convince you that Leonard isn’t still on the level of the elite of the elite. — R.NGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks There’s no shame here in Giannis ceding the top spot on our list, and it may not take much for him to reclaim it. He offers more on a nightly basis than any player in the league. He’s a seven-foot-tall athletic marvel, and his ballyhooed quest to make the Finals cannot be held against him in an exercise like this. There may not be a player in the league, from stars to scrubs, who pours as much of himself into a given game than Antetokounmpo. Using his length, explosiveness and intelligence, he dominates the interior, he breeds transition offense, he finds teammates, and he wins games. There are games where his jumper doesn’t fall — the only true critique of his game at age 26 — but Antetokounmpo doesn’t take nights off. It is noteworthy that those shooting woes tend to manifest in the playoffs, when opponents wall off the paint and take their chances. The consecutive, unceremonious exits are blots on his ledger. But there is also room for improvement, and in the context of a player who so genuinely cares about being great, we should be optimistic that the jumper will come. (Plus, he’s pretty damn effective without it).Antetokounmpo continues to improve each year, launching those threes more often than ever before, getting to the foul line more, rebounding better and making even more of his minutes, all while shouldering a league-high 37.5% usage rate in 2019–20. After all, this is the two-time reigning MVP and the Defensive Player of the Year. Where many of the league’s stars have plateaued in their 20s, Antetokounmpo continues to add wrinkles to his game. It will only continue to slow down for him. His production is the NBA’s most valuable constant. He comes in second here, only because arguably the greatest player in league history has yet to slow down in any meaningful way. So this is where we leave Giannis, as more 1B than true No. 2. —J.W.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated1. LeBron James, Los Angeles LakersIt’s been 18 years of LeBron James, and we are spoiled. The King has now spent nearly half of his entire life in the NBA. He has little left to prove in terms of individual accolades or statistics. His sheer longevity speaks for itself. And after piloting the Lakers to a title, adjusting his game yet again to make it happen, he regains the top spot in this ranking after briefly ceding it a year ago. The mind-boggling amount of mileage on his body weighs on your mind, the half-step he’s lost athletically crops up time and again, and James can’t just flip the switch quite the way he used to. He requires maintenance and rest. He’ll take plays off defensively and weeks off mentally. At this point, these are things we have to simply accept. The meaty LeBron discourse can be picked clean from any angle. It can be exhausting. His case as the No. 1 player in an exercise like this no longer feels or reads as an absolute truth. Yet it remains the logical answer, knowing all that we know about who he is when the challenge boils down to winning or losing a game.As last season reminded us, in any contest with stakes, there’s not another player you’d take ahead of James. He’s the best player on the planet when he wants to be. And when things matter, that’s always going to be what he wants. The Lakers are favorites to repeat for that reason. LeBron led the NBA in assists for the first time as a 35-year-old, and it didn’t happen by accident. That vision and wherewithal isn’t going to be what fails him. James still finds ways to swing the outcome of games in unexpected fashion. When there are great players around him, he doesn’t simply fit with them—he takes their play to another level. While still giving full credit to Anthony Davis, everyone knows that his on-court life has never been easier, with James on the floor to dictate where the ball should be, to draw defenses, and maximize the quality and ease of his shot attempts. The Lakers’ championship doesn’t happen without that level of synergy. It all still revolves around LeBron, in a way no other player can replicate. He’s proven that it will not be his brain or his skills that lead to his decline. It’s a different brand of dominance now, but the impact and the weight of his influence remain unmatched when things count. It’s all about the end result.How much longer James will hold the top spot is anyone’s guess, and going into this season, there are plenty of comers. But it feels certain that this is not the time to take it from him. And that’s where we’ve landed. —J.W.GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five? By not changing anything at all. With a berth in Qatar on the line in a place the U.S. has never won, it’s all business.The Bucks forward’s block came in a critical moment in the fourth quarter to solidify a 118-116 win.\n",

      "screenrant.com10 Best Marvel Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerWhile the MCU has propelled these characters' popularity to new heights, Marvel's comic iterations of these superheroes rank high among fans.Being the other half of the \"big two\" comic book publishers, Marvel Comics has its respective catalog of beloved and iconic superheroes. Disney and Marvel Studios' sweeping MCU propelled these characters to gargantuan new heights and helped the superhero genre's popularity in movies with it.RELATED: 10 Marvel Heroes Darker Than Their VillainsThe voting community at Ranker has compiled a top 10 list of the publisher's best heroes. Over the decades, these characters have either seen their legacies endure like Spider-Man and Wolverine, to others seeing strong surges in terms of mainstream appeal like Deadpool and Black Panther.Elizabeth Olsen's portrayal of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in the MCU has bolstered her reputation, and especially so with her and Vision's WandaVision series on Disney+, adding some intrigue to the universe. Being a mutant herself, her origins in the comics were tied from the start to the X-Men, making her debut in the '60s comic book series.Her character arcs in the comics have taken her from being a villain to a regular member of the Avengers along with the X-Men. Scarlet Witch's life has involved dramatic stories tied to Magneto, but it ended up leading her to revelations regarding her true lineage. She has plenty of ripe lore in the source material, making it interesting to speculate where Scarlet Witch will be taken in MCU's Phase Four and beyond.Black Panther is regarded by fans as one of 2018's best movies and a landmark in the MCU and superhero movie genre. He was the medium's first African superhero in his debut in the '60s and has now cemented his status as a pop-culture icon. T'Challa has a rich history in the comics spanning decades, with his stories varying in scope and settings such as Hell's Kitchen to outer space.Different comic arcs have focused on personal themes of T'Challa, and while the MCU tends to focus on grand Avengers-level storylines, Black Panther has gotten numerous grounded stories alongside the large-scale ones. These stories have been known to reach intimate levels on the scale of Daredevil or Spider-Man's comics.Steve Rogers as Captain America is another superhero that quickly comes to fans' minds when hearing Marvel's brand name. He's long since been established as one of the core members of the Avengers -- both in the MCU and comics. Captain America is also a fascinating character to explore social commentary, as his introduction came during World War II as a piece of propaganda to aid America's war effort.RELATED: 10 Best Comic-Accurate Costumes, RankedOver the decades, Captain America has been faced with challenges concerning his ideals and what it means to be \"patriotic.\" Rogers gradually became a more grounded, humanized character in tackling these kinds of ideas, and his \"everyman\" appeal is still strong today as it was 80 years ago when he was created.The Hulk is a classic flagship hero from Marvel's comics, and if reports are true, it appears he's finally getting another solo project in the MCU. He's another one of the legendary Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creations for the publisher and still stands as one of Marvel's strongest \"monster\" characters.Hulk had several genre-defining story arcs, including Planet Hulk and World War Hulk, with the latter rumored to influence the MCU project. Throughout the years, Hulk has undergone numerous transformations, from his \"savage\" persona in the 1970s to his \"smart\" persona in the '80s and '90s, that have kept his character fresh and vital throughout the decades. His current iteration in The Immortal Hulk draws heavily on his horror monster roots and is one of Marvel's most acclaimed titles.One of the more obscure but powerful magical characters, Doctor Strange has also been getting his due recognition as Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme. Strange is also one of the most intelligent heroes in the universe, with his origins focusing on an initial fall from grace and humbling.Being a talented but arrogant, egotistical surgeon, Strange undergoes a compelling soul-searching quest that started as a desperate attempt to heal his hands. His stories naturally explore the more mystical corners of the Marvel Universe, and things could take an exciting, more emphasized turn in that direction for the upcoming Multiverse of Madness.The Merc with a Mouth exploded into the mainstream with Ryan Reynolds' depiction in the movies, but he's been a fan-favorite in comic book circles before then. He's one of the most popular anti-heroes and cases of \"breaking the 4th wall\" in the superhero genre while being involved in wonderfully chaotic stories alongside Marvel's vast cast of characters.RELATED: 10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About DeadpoolDeadpool's dark, gory, and hilarious exploits have evolved into several memorable dynamics with the likes of Wolverine, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and even Captain America. With the raunchy charisma Deadpool has, it was only a matter of time before wider audiences fell in love with the character.In addition to being what's essentially the poster boy for the X-Men, Wolverine has a longstanding reputation in Marvel overall. Hugh Jackman's portrayal certainly helped, but from the movies back the comics, James \"Logan\" Howlett has a high standard of quality when it comes to storytelling. He's prime for the gritty noir narratives Marvel wants to tell with the \"tragic hero\" element to him.Wolverine's immense strength and durability come at the cost of having to outlive several of his loved ones, growing cynical and jaded in the process. Arcs like Weapon X show the hero's dark beginnings and highlight how much he's grown along the way, and other fan-favorites like Old Man Logan expertly mix comic book absurdity with emotional impact.Thor in the comics was also a founding member of the Avengers, but he's become a character known for going through notable growth. Humanizing a literal god is a tough task for any writer, but his mythos and the several creative teams involved have succeeded in creating a God of Thunder that can come down to Earth and feel human.Modern comics have done him continued justice, with story arcs like Godbomb blending the epic-scale action and art worthy of being Norse-inspired along with some psychological character studies. Throwing three incarnations of Thor against one of Marvel's best comic villains, Gorr the God Butcher, served as a thrilling backdrop for this.Nick Fury was the in-universe architect for establishing the MCU's Avengers, but Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired take on Iron Man was the spark. Iron Man was also a fairly obscure superhero outside of comic book circles, but from a mix of years of development in the comics and the movies shining a spotlight on him, he's also grown into a memorable character in the source medium.RELATED: 10 Most Powerful Variants Of Iron Man In Marvel ComicsIn the last decade, star comic writers like Matt Fraction (of Hawkeye fame) and Kieron Gillen made the hero accessible for new fans looking to see what they may have missed. These writers helped modernize Iron Man by emphasizing relatable flaws such as his traumatic childhood or struggles with alcoholism while still introducing fun and exciting characters like Ironheart, who is poised to succeed Tony as Marvel's armored Avenger.It's no surprise that fans voted Spider-Man as Marvel's best superhero. Well outside of Ranker, the Wall-Crawler has already firmly established himself as the world's most popular and highest-grossing individual superhero IP, with only Batman coming close.He was Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's magnum opus, striking an excellent balance of a bonafide action hero that inspires good, and a down-to-earth, flawed, and relatable young man that's just trying to do good with the hand he was dealt. Whether grieving the death of Gwen Stacy or saving the world in such iconic storylines as Secret Wars and Civil War, Spider-Man has been the central figure in the Marvel Universe and continues to be in numerous comics, films, television shows, and video games.NEXT: The Best Non-Superhero Characters In Spider-Man ComicsGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he now resides in Houston. He is a fan of pretty much anything involving nerd culture. Video games, comics, movies, TV, anime, manga, you name it.

He starts as an arrogant engineer kidnapped by a syndicate who wanted him to create a deadly weapon. Instead of giving the syndicate what they wanted, Tony Stark created a suit to help him escape. He became Iron Man and the founding member of the Avengers with the help of Nick Fury. In Endgame, his character arc comes full circle when he performs the ultimate sacrifice, which was to become a suit of armor to the world.  Peter Parker was only in high school when he got bit by a radioactive spider, making him one of the youngest Marvel heroes in the Marvel Universe. Spider-Man can shoot webs and climb walls vertically. The young hero is optimistic yet quite reckless. He fights bad guys with a laugh… yet still can’t muster enough courage to ask his crush MJ out. Read: Top 50 Marvel Gifts Professor X was born a telepath who can control and influence other people’s minds. He founded a school for gifted young people aptly named Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters in the Marvel Universe and taught confused and frightened mutants how best to use their powers. Notable alumni include Marvel characters like Jean Grey and Cyclops.  Thor wields the mighty Mjolnir, making him one of the strongest Marvel characters. He is the son of Odin and Earth-goddess Gaea, making him a powerful yet arrogant hybrid god of Asgard. Odin makes him learn the value of humility. He has him exiled to Earth, where he begins life as a doctor named Donald Blake alongside nurse Jane Foster. When his father discovers his profound changes, he asks him to come home, but Thor refuses. He loses his weapon and arm while fighting villains in both realms but doesn’t lose his drive to become one of the most powerful characters. Read: Thor vs Captain Marvel When Steve Rogers first volunteered to defend America in World War Two, he was rejected due to his scrawny physique. He was, however, chosen to become a participant in an experiment called “Project: Rebirth.” Little did he know that this was a trial to create super soldiers by using a serum to grant them immensely powerful superhuman strength. He becomes a secret soldier of the country and dons a red, white, and blue costume, thus becoming the hero Captain America. He is best friends with Bucky Barnes, who becomes the Winter Soldier. He strongly upholds wanting to do what is right all the time… even if it means fighting against his teammates in Avengers: Civil War. Also Read: Red Guardian vs Captain America Natasha Romanoff was trained as an agent under the Black Widow Program. As a longtime opponent of the Avengers, Hawkeye was sent to get rid of her… but he saved her instead. Completely turning her back on her old life, Black Widow becomes a member of both the Avengers and SHIELD. She didn’t lose her torturous ways, though, preferring to use brutality against villains. In Endgame, the female hero seeks redemption for her past misdeeds and sacrifices herself to bring back those lost. Read: When Does Black Widow Take Place in the MCU Timeline As far as she could remember, Jean Grey, aka Phoenix, has always had telekinetic abilities. She is one of the founding members of the X-men and is an instructor at Professor X’s school. She is extremely compassionate and always puts other people first. She believes in peace and hopes that humans and mutants will be able to coexist without prejudice one day. Read: Marvel vs DC What happened to Chadwick Boseman was unfortunate, but his performance as T’Challa in the Black Panther movie paved the way for heroes and cultures of African American origin. Black Panther is a title that is passed down to the King of Wakanda. The black and silver suit is made from vibranium, one of the strongest elements in the Marvel universe. He is one of the greatest heroes, always ready to defend Wakanda against anyone who threatens to disrupt its peace.Read: Top 45 Marvel Quotes Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, was initially a supervillain on Team Magneto. She wields incredible power and can even be the strongest in the entire Marvel Universe. She realizes that she is fighting for the wrong team and joins our heroes. She is incredibly caring to those important to her and is devoted to protecting innocents. Read: How Long Would It Take to Watch All MCU Movies Ant-Man starts as an antihero… after all, Scott Lang spent some time in prison before becoming the bite-sized hero. He was personally recommended by Falcon to become an official member of the Avengers and helped in obtaining the Infinity Stones from the micro-universe. He is a good guy and is always pushing himself to try new things.  Falcon is extremely loyal to Captain America. In fact, he was personally chosen by Captain himself to carry his shield when he made the decision to retire to a past timeline. In the Marvel comic books, he becomes Captain America himself. Sam Wilson worked in the United States Air Force before joining the Avengers. He is a powerful war machine on wings whose reliability makes him one of the best Marvel heroes.  For some reason, Thanos spared Gamora when he wiped her entire species out. He raised her like a daughter and trained her to become a deadly assassin. Because of this, Gamora knew Thanos better than anyone else, and she showed bravery and willingness to do whatever it took to bring him down, even if it meant sacrificing her own life. Read: Marvel Painting Ideas & Tips Stephen Strange starts as an obnoxious surgeon who came to his senses after a car accident rendered him useless. Desperate to find a solution, he dabbled in voodoo and visited the Ancient One in the East. The Ancient One didn’t only restore his skills but also taught the character mysticism and magic (and a bit of humility). He eventually becomes a member of the Avengers and in their fights against villains. Read: Best Way To Watch Marvel Movies Born on Earth but raised in Space, half-human Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, spearheaded the Guardians of the Galaxy. This treasure hunter is devious and cheeky, but deep down, he is extremely sentimental about things he cares for. Don’t believe us? Get this: the heroes would’ve easily won the first time they faced Thanos if it weren’t for his emotions over Gamora’s death in Infinity War.  Although Hawkeye is deadly when he’s armed with his bow and arrow, he’s obviously the weakest among the Marvel superheroes. Clint Barton is a family man, putting his wife and kids above everything. He understands that the world needs him… but his family needs him more.  Wolverine is an integral part of X-men. He was born a sickly kid in the 1880s until his powers manifested and bone claws came out of his knuckles. He eventually got recruited by Professor X. While Wolverine favors action over reason, his heart remains in the right place. It also wouldn’t hurt for him to tone down the violence once in a while.  The green-skinned Hulk is a powerful hero that can crush everything he gets his palms on. Bruce Banner wasn’t always this way, though. After the accidental explosion of a gamma bomb, the physicist gets exposed to radiation and discovers that he could turn green and strong when he gets angry. Bruce loathes himself for being unable to control the monster inside him and hopes to find a way to guide his alter-ego in the right direction.  When Galactus came to his planet to devour it, Norrin Rodd offered himself as herald instead. Galactus took him up on his offer and granted him powers, which turned him silver and indestructible, as well as a surfboard so that he may search the universe at the speed of light. He lost his memory in the process. He met the Fantastic Four heroes who helped him rediscover his old self when he landed on Earth. With the help of the Fantastic Four, he managed to defeat Galactus.  Matt Murdock was bullied because his father wanted him to stay home and study instead of roughhousing out in the streets. His kind heart led him to save an oblivious blind man crossing the street towards an oncoming truck. The truck crashed, and its contents — which turned out to be a radioactive isotope — spilled out and blinded Matt but granted him superhuman senses. Daredevil is a lawyer by day and at the same time a crimefighter at night and sees helping innocents as a personal duty.  After being exposed to the Tesseract, US Air Force pilot Carol Danvers obtained cosmic powers, making her one of the strongest heroes in the entire Marvel universe. However, she lost all memory of being Carol Danvers after the Kree kidnapped her. During a chance landing on Earth, she had glimpses of her past life and discovered that the Kree was using her all along. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest Marvel heroes, although she doesn’t like answering to anyone. Read: Captain Marvel vs Ms MarvelWe’re not sure why people hate Captain Marvel. Perhaps it’s the way the character is portrayed as being quite cocky? Or perhaps they don’t like the way Brie Larson plays her? Either way, people think she took up way too much screen time for someone who is fairly new to the franchise. In an online poll [1], heroes Iron Man and Captain America tied for the favorite Avenger spot. It’s no wonder these two are on top as they are extremely charismatic characters portrayed by effective actors. The Marvel Universe is a complex world with thousands of different characters in the MCU movies, each with their unique personalities.If you’re a fan of the universe, check out our Marvel merch at Toynk.  Reference:1. https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/iron-man-captain-america-voted-favorite-avengersConnecting people with their favorite pop-culture products every day.\n",

      "20 of the most iconic heroes in the DC universeAbove all else, heroes endure — and DC has had some of the most beloved heroes in the world as part of its ranks since the invention of superhero comics. Of course, there have been missteps along the way — but anything that's around for 90 years isn't going to come out unscathed. If you're lucky, there are way more hits than misses — and by that standard, DC has been very lucky indeed. Here's a look back at some of the greats that DC has given us over the years. First appearance: Detective Comics #233 (1956); rebooted in 52 Week #7, released June 21, 2006Created by: Kathy Kane (1956): Edmond Hamilton and Sheldon Moldoff; Kate Kane (2006): Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Keith GiffenWhy we love them: In 1956, National Comics — DC's predecessor — decided that Batman needed a love interest to prove that he wasn't in a gay relationship with Robin. The Kathy Kane incarnation of Batwoman was plenty badass despite having been created primarily as a love interest — but she was eventually killed off in 1979. In 2006, Batwoman was reborn as part of DC's 52 series — this time, as complete certified badass Kate Kane, who is also an out and proud lesbian. During the December 2018 Arrowverse crossover event \"Elseworlds,\" Batwoman made her small-screen debut, played by Ruby Rose.First appearance: All-American Comics #16 (July 1940)Created by: Bill Finger and Martin NodellWhy we love them: There have been a few Green Lanterns over the years — Hal Jordan is probably the best known, but there's also Guy Gardner, John Stewart (who was one of the first Black superheroes to grace comics in general), and Kyle Rayner, as well. Rings filled with the green energy of willpower and created by the Guardians of the Universe are worn by all members of the Green Lantern Corps — and anyone or anything can be a Green Lantern if they have a ring. So far, Green Lantern had his own live-action major motion picture debut in a film of the same name that starred Ryan Reynolds as the Hal Jordan incarnation. Reynolds himself pointedly mocked that role later on as \"Deadpool,\" so you're probably better off reading the comics.First appearance: Al Pratt version: All-American Comics #19 (October 1940); Ray Palmer sub-atomic version: Showcase #34  (October 1961)Created by: Bill O'Connor and Ben Flinton; revamped sub-atomically by Gil Kane and Gardner FoxWhy we love them:  In the comics, after Ray Palmer disappeared, Palmer protege Ryan Choi stepped up to become the Atom thanks to creators Gail Simone and Grant Morrison in the DCU \"Brave New World\" series.Currently, the Ray Palmer version of the Atom is played by Brandon Routh in the Arrowverse CW show \"Legends of Tomorrow\" after he was introduced on \"The Flash.\" Routh also played Superman on the big screen in \"Superman Returns\" — which is a fairly unique situation. Routh told ABC News,\"I often get asked what's better to play, Superman or The Atom,\" he said. \"Superman was like the pinnacle of all superheroes and the movie that made my career, so you can't really compare, necessarily, but they are all fun.\"First appearance: More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940)Created by: Gardner Fox and Howard ShermanWhy we love them: Over time, the mystical object known as the Helmet of Nabu conferred virtually unlimited magical powers upon its wearer — in part because it was also possessed by the spirit of the ancient being known as Nabu. Teleportation, precognition — you name it, he can probably do it.The helmet originally bonded with Kent Nelson, whose father Sven had initially discovered the tomb of Nabu. There have been other Doctors Fate in the comics, but the Kent Nelson version was a recurring character on \"Smallville\" played by Brent Stait.First appearance: Black Lightning #1 (April 1977)Created by: Tony Isabella and Trevor Von EedenWhy we love them: The character of Black Lightning was DC's first African-American superhero to headline his own book — but initially, the company had some objectively terrible ideas about how they wanted to play it. The company originally intended to create the character as a white racist who magically transformed into a black superhero when he was stressed out. Tony Isabella — who had previously worked on the Luke Cage comic at Marvel and also created the character of Misty Knight — stepped in and created Jefferson Pierce instead. A mild-mannered and inspiring educator by day, badass crimefighter in his community by night — the character of Black Lightning is currently played by Cress Williams in the \"Black Lightning\" series on the CW.First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: Princess Koriand'r of Tamaran can't just fly — she can fly faster than light and survive the cold vastness of space with no external help. She's also able to use ultraviolet light as a weapon thanks to some sketchy experimentation that was done to her after her jealous sister betrayed her and forced her into slavery when she was young.Kory honed her skills, broke free, and headed to Earth to become Starfire — and she's currently played by Anna Diop on the DC Universe series \"Titans.\"First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: As the half-demon, half-human daughter of the interdimensional demon Trigon and human Angela Roth, Rachel Roth had to learn how to control her emotions from an early age — or risk destroying the universe. Luckily, she can channel those emotions into powers. Raven — Rachel — is currently played by Teagan Croft on DC Universe's \"Titans.\"First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: As a human/technology hybrid who's able to interface with any and all technology with ease, Victor Stone — Cyborg — is clearly a guy you want on your team. Also, his cybernetic implants give him super strength, speed, and endurance.Cyborg has made three live-action appearances so far. In \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" and \"Justice League,\" he was portrayed by Ray Fisher. In the upcoming DC Universe series \"Doom Patrol,\" he'll be played by Joivan Wade.First appearance: More Fun Comics #73 (October 31, 1941)Created by: Mort Weisinger and Paul NorrisWhy we may eventually love them: As DC and Marvel continually kept one-upping each other's character ideas over time, some were bound to work immediately — and others weren't. Aquaman has had more screen time outside of DC properties than any other character on this list, all thanks to constantly being mocked in pop culture.The Jason Momoa incarnation of Aquaman has graced the big screen in \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Justice League,\" and his solo film debut \"Aquaman\" — and he's working hard to change our minds while still being a good sea life steward.Whether this love will last remains to be seen — but if there is anything movie and comics fans both love, it's a good redemption story.First appearance: Flash Comics #86 (August 1947)Created by: Robert Kanigher and Carmine InfantinoWhy we love them: Utilizing both her martial arts and detective skills, Black Canary isn't so different from Batman — minus the Wayne family fortune, of course. It's a combination of admirable and aspirational character traits that fans have been loving practically forever. Black Canary in live-action form has been played by Danuta Wesley in \"Legends of the Superheroes,\" Rachel Skarsten in \"Birds of Prey,\" Alaina Huffman in \"Smallville\" — and most recently, Katie Cassidy and Juliana Harkavy have played different incarnations of the character on \"Arrow.\"First appearance: The Saga of the Swamp Thing #25 (June 1984)Created by: Alan Moore, Stephen Bissette, and John TotlebenWhy we love them: Tapping into powers of the occult is otherworldly but not automatically considered a superpower in the way that, say, the powers of flight or superhuman strength might be. Also, did we mention that he's an infamous and blatant con artist? If anything, over time, Constantine has proven himself to be more of an antihero than anything — but that's why he's so appealing.The character has made live-action appearances played by Keanu Reeves in the movie \"Constantine\" and by Matt Ryan in the short-lived \"Constantine\" TV series, as well as \"Arrow.\" Ryan plays the character now on \"Legends of Tomorrow.\" First appearance: Doom Patrol #99 (November 1965)Created by: Arnold Drake and Bob BrownWhy we love them: Garfield Logan was a normal enough kid — until he developed a rare disease that almost killed him. Luckily, his parents were two brilliant scientists, and they tried a previously untested experimental treatment on young Garfield that both saved his life and turned him into Beast Boy. Maybe you wouldn't want that ability, and maybe you would — but it's definitely cool that someone with Garfield's personality has it.He's portrayed by Ryan Potter in the DC Universe series \"Titans.\"First appearance: Action Comics #252 (May 1959)Created by: Otto Binder and Al PlastinoWhy we love them: Superman is Superman in part because of his human family — but what if you were a Kryptonian and had all the powers that entails but didn't end up with adoptive parents like Clark's? You'd be a different person — you'd be Supergirl. Kara Zor-El — cousin to Kal-El — was adopted in the comics by the Danvers family. Eventually, she gave her life to save everyone else, including her cousin — and died in the book Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 (October 1985). In live-action form, Supergirl has been played by Helen Slater in the 1984 \"Supergirl\" movie, Laura Vandervoort on \"Smallville,\" and is currently played by Melissa Benoist on the CW's \"Supergirl\" series.First appearance: (as Robin) Detective Comics #38 (April 1940); (as Nightwing) Tales of the Teen Titans #44 (July 1984)Created by: Dick Grayson/Robin created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger; Nightwing created by Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: Even the most casual fans of Batman know about Robin — and some might even know that there's been more than one person behind the mask over time. The first Robin was Dick Grayson, whom Bruce Wayne adopted as an orphan and trained to fulfill his role as Robin. Over time, Dick Grayson began to question what he was doing as Batman's sidekick — before eventually deciding that although he wanted to be a hero, he also wanted to do it his own way. He handed over his costume — and permission — to a new orphan named Jason Todd, who would go on to become the new Robin.Soon after, Dick Grayson reappeared as Nightwing. Although fans of DC animated offerings have seen Nightwing several times onscreen, it's likely we'll be getting at least one live-action representation of him soon. A Nightwing movie has been announced, although no details are available yet. It's possible that we'll see Nightwing sooner via DC Universe's \"Titans,\" which makes sense. The Dick Grayson/Robin there — played by Brenton Thwaites — is clearly transitioning away from his previous Robin role as Batman's sidekick. Jason Todd has also been introduced, so it's a distinct possibility.First appearance: Detective Comics #359 (January 1967)Created by: Gardner Fox and Carmine InfantinoWhy we love them: Much like Batwoman, Batgirl was introduced back in the day to make Batman and Robin's relationship seem less homoerotic. Unlike Batwoman, the character of Batgirl didn't fade away and disappear for 30 years — instead, she developed into an integral part of the team. In 1988, courtesy of Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's book \"The Killing Joke,\" the Joker shot Barbara Gordon through the spine and paralyzed her. Barbara Gordon adapted to her new circumstances and used her brilliant mind to become Oracle — evolving yet again. DC decided it wanted to have the Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl — not Bette Kane, Stephanie Brown, or Cassandra Cain, who had all also been Batgirl in the comics — back again for its New 52 relaunch in 2011. By then, Babs had been Oracle for 23 years.This was a controversial move at the time — as there simply aren't a whole lot of disabled superhero stories being told by anyone, let alone as well-respected a writer as Gail Simone. Live-action versions of Batgirl have been portrayed by Yvonne Craig on the Adam West-starring ‘60s \"Batman\" TV series and Alicia Silverstone in the movie \"Batman and Robin\" (though it's worth noting that although she was Batgirl, she was not Barbara Gordon — the movie created a character not seen elsewhere in DC lore called Barbara Wilson, a niece of Alfred Pennyworth). A live-action Batgirl movie is reportedly in development.First appearance: as Jay Garrick: Flash Comics #1 (January 1940); as Barry Allen: Showcase #4 (October 1956); as Wally West: The Flash #110 (January 1960); as Bart Allen: Flash Vol. 2 #92 (July 1994)Created by: Jay Garrick version: Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert; Barry Allen version: Robert Kanigher, John Broome, and Carmine Infantino; Wally West version: John Broome and Carmine Infantino ; Bart Allen version: Mark Waid and Mike WieringoWhy we love them: The Flash started with Jay Garrick, a college student who had a terrible laboratory accident that mysteriously gave him super-speed. When the hero known as the Flash was rebooted as police scientist Barry Allen in 1956, the idea of updating heroes for modern times was born — and comics literally have not been the same ever since. For example, the current Barry Allen as seen in the CW tv series \"The Flash\" is now a forensic scientist — a profession that didn't even exist when the character was first introduced in the comics. As you might imagine, the Flash has been portrayed in various live-action incarnations. In 1979, \"Legends of the Superheroes\" specials saw him played by Rod Haase; in the 1990 TV series \"The Flash,\" he was played by John Wesley Shipp; in \"Smallville,\" he was played by Kyle Gallner; in the Arrowverse shows, he's played by Grant Gustin and John Wesley Shipp, while Keiynan Lonsdale plays Kid Flash; in the DCEU movies, he's currently played by Ezra Miller. First appearance: More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941)Created by: Mort Weisinger and George PappWhy we love them: Who doesn't like a story about an obnoxious, spoiled rich kid who gets trapped on an island, has to master the use of a bow and arrow to survive, and develops a purpose in life by fighting greed and corruption once he finds his way back home? That's the story of Oliver Queen — who's similar to Bruce Wayne in that his choice to use his immense wealth to fund his fight for justice is his superpower. In live-action roles, Green Arrow has been portrayed by Justin Hartley on \"Smallville,\" Stephen Amell in the Arrowverse series on the CW, and Joseph David-Jones as the Connor Hawke Green Arrow in \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow.\"First appearance: Action Comics #1 (June 1938)Created by: Jerry Siegel and Joe ShusterWhy we love them: Put simply, Superman is the hero that everyone else looks up to — the one that everyone else wants to be. It's his sheer goodness and drive to do the right thing that makes his appeal so enduring. His amazing powers don't hurt, but they wouldn't work without his innate goodness.Superman has been portrayed in live-action form by George Reeves in the \"Adventures of Superman\" ‘50s TV series and the \"Superman and the Mole Men\" movie; Christopher Reeve in the \"Superman,\" \"Superman II,\" \"Superman III,\" and \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" movies; Dean Cain in the \"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" series; Tom Welling as Clark Kent pre-Superman in \"Smallville\"; Brandon Routh in the movie \"Superman Returns,\" Henry Cavill in the movies \"Man of Steel,\" \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" and \"Justice League\"; and Tyler Hoechlin on \"Supergirl.\"  First appearance: All-Star Comics #8 (December 1941)Created by: William Moulton Marston, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, Olive Byrne, Harry G. PeterWhy we love them: So many heroes have a tragic origin story that spurs them to become the best possible versions of themselves — but not Wonder Woman. Formed out of clay, given life by Zeus, and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta on the Paradise Island inhabited only by women — also known as Themyscira — Diana's origin story is the stuff of very pleasant dreams rather than fevered nightmares. And then she proceeds to fight with love — not with anger, nor with hastily weaponized hate. This simple choice is what makes her unique among superheroes. Despite her status as an internationally beloved character whose fame has only grown over the many years she's been around, Wonder Woman has had relatively few live-action depictions onscreen. She's been played by Cathy Lee Crosby in the 1974 made-for-TV \"Wonder Woman\" movie, by Lynda Carter in the \"Wonder Woman\" TV series, and by Gal Gadot in \"Batman vs Superman,\" \"Justice League,\" and Patty Jenkins' 2017 \"Wonder Woman\" and upcoming \"Wonder Woman 1984\" films. First appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May 1939)Created by: Bob Kane and Bill FingerWhy we love them: The tale of a boy raised by his butler after his parents were horribly murdered in a dark alley by criminals — and who then grows up to use his detective skills and considerable financial resources to fight crime in his city — is practically irresistible. It's no wonder that various outlets have crowned Batman \"the greatest superhero ever.\" Live-action Batman turns have been performed by Adam West in the ‘60s \"Batman\" TV series; Michael Keaton in the Tim Burton-directed \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" films; Val Kilmer in the \"Batman Forever\" film; George Clooney in the \"Batman and Robin\" film; Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy; David Mazouz as a young Bruce Wayne who is developing into Batman on the Fox TV series \"Gotham\"; and Ben Affleck in the DCEU films \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Suicide Squad,\" and \"Justice League.\"Visit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n",

      "UPDATE:If you want to see the best DC characters suit up once more on screen, then you are in luck as Zack Snyder's Justice League is now streaming on HBO Go and NOW in the UK. It's a four-hour supercut of the original movie that takes out everything Joss Whedon did and adds in things like the Joker. It's definitely one for 'super' fans, then. While Marvel tends to specialise in ‘normal’ street-level heroes with everyday concerns, DC has always had a thing for iconic god-like figures living among us mere mortals. Many are memorable characters who’ve survived numerous reinventions, whose logos are recognisable to people who’ve never read a comic in their lives. DC is also home to a rogues’ gallery of classic villains – led by the despicable likes of the Joker and Lex Luthor – Marvel can only dream of.\r\n",

On the big screen, the Joker has a couple of Oscars to his name (step forward Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix), so he really is a bad guy with plenty to smile about.\r\n",
      "The best Batman graphic novels, rankedPop culture’s most famous orphan and an all-round good egg, Superman has been a legend ever since he swooped into the first issue of Action Comics in 1938. While he wasn’t the first character with superpowers, the last son of Krypton set the standard against which all subsequent heroes would be judged, from his iconic suit/cape combo to his famous other life as mild-mannered alter-ego Clark Kent. Although bad guys can exploit his soft spot for humanity and susceptibility to kryptonite, Supes’ impressive combo of super strength, flight and laser-beam eyes make sure he’s more than strong enough to defeat most evil-doers in Metropolis.\r\n",
      "William Moulton Marston lived such an interesting life he was the subject of 2017 biopic Dr Marston and the Wonder Women. The American psychologist is widely credited as the inventor of the polygraph but – perhaps more importantly – he was also the brains behind Wonder Woman. Setting out to introduce a hero whose power came from love as much as physical strength, Marston created an icon, an immortal Amazon princess whose powers flowed directly from the Greek gods. Diana’s been saving the world since World War 2 and is still going strong.\r\n",
      "Being the fastest man alive is pretty cool – just ask Usain Bolt – but there’s more to Jay Allen/Barry Allen/Wally West/Bart Allen (pick your favourite Central City Speedster) than running really, really quickly. The Flash’s skillset has evolved over time, taking in incredible endurance, the ability to pass through walls (quantum tunnelling) and, thanks to his handy ability to move faster than light, time travel. Given the storytelling potential of leaping backwards and forwards in history, it’s clear that – whoever’s wearing the suit – the Flash will always be one of the Justice League’s MVPs. Considering she’s one of the most iconic, most cosplayed characters in the DC universe, it’s strange Harley Quinn didn’t make her debut in the pages of a comic. Instead her first appearance came on TV, in a 1992 episode of Batman: The Animated Series, and she made an instant impact as the Joker’s long-term love interest and partner in crime. Before going bad she was Dr Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist at Gotham’s Arkham Asylum – but having the Joker inside your head is a dangerous thing, and she ended up as crazy and dangerous as he is. He wasn’t originally a DC character at all and, even more confusingly, used to go by the name of Captain Marvel. But, having emerged as Fawcett Comics’ answer to Superman in the early 1940s, the hero now known as Shazam eventually found his way into the DC stable.\r\n",
      "His origin story is like a mix of Superted and Bananaman, as orphaned teen Billy Batson utters a magic word and finds himself transformed into a musclebound adult with an impressive selection of magical powers – it’s not a bad way to avoid doing homework.\r\n",
      "Possessing seemingly lesser powers like breathing underwater, swimming really fast and being able to converse with fish, Arthur Curry had become a figure of fun in the DC universe – even before Entourage and Family Guy made him the butt of many a joke. But the last decade has seen an extensive campaign of character rehabilitation for the king of Atlantis. Various comic book reboots and Jason Momoa’s performances on the big screen turned Aquaman into one of the coolest members of the Justice League.\r\n",
      "Power-hungry billionaire businessman turns out to be an evil man? What are the chances? If you’re going to be Superman’s arch-enemy, there’s no point trying to defeat the Man of Steel with brawn. Instead, Lex Luthor uses his genius-level intellect, shrewd business brain and all-round ruthless streak to make sure he’s a constant thorn in Clark Kent’s side. Brainiac, General Zod and Doomsday may be more obviously powerful, but Lex is Superman’s ultimate nemesis.\r\n",
      "She’s not faster than a speeding bullet or more powerful than a locomotive, and she’s unable to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Nonetheless, Superman needs Lois Lane as much as she needs him. Yes, she has a habit of getting herself into dangerous situations that require a spot of Kryptonian intervention, but that’s mainly because she’s such a brilliant, tenacious reporter that personal safety is subservient to a good story. Lois Lane does, however, have one massive weakness. While the comics have attempted to explain her inability to see that Clark Kent and Superman are the same person, her struggle to defeat a pair of specs is baffling.\r\n",

      "Best Comics of 2020 (So Far): Marvel ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — Now that we’re roughly a quarter of the way into 2020, we thought it’d be fun to start taking a look at the best comics of 2020 so far, starting with far and away the most prolific comics publisher — Marvel Comics.  To that end, below you will find a list of the best comics of 2020 from Marvel so far, with extra attention given to whether a series is easy for new or lapsed readers to hop onto, pick-up, or just generally understand.So yeah, Marvel list is below, and we’ll be rolling out similar best comics of 2020 (so far) lists for DC Comics, Image Comics, and a number of other publishers in the weeks and months to come...enjoy!This is a section for readers who want to get involved with Marvel’s current crop of monthly comic books, and as such, it only includes titles that are coming out monthly right here, right now. Some (as we’ll note below) may require some trade reading to catch-up on, but these are the best of the best, so it’s worth it.1. X-MenWriter: Jonathan HickmanMain Series Artist: Leinil Francis Yu (primarily)Most Recent Issue (as of publication): X-Men #8Next Issue: X-Men #9 is due out March 25, 2020Why Is This So Good: The hottest thing at Marvel Comics in 2020 (so far) is the X-Men line. You can make a case (and we will) for Immortal Hulk being a better comic, but nothing is doling out the fully immersive, high-concept mosaic of stories that make superhero periodicals so unique, like X-Men. Within the X-Men line, however, it can be tough to know what to read. So let’s get to it.X-Men is the flagship title for a linewide X-Men reinvention project undertaken by mad superhero comics mastermind Jonathan Hickman and a wide range of very talented collaborators. There is an overarching new world for the X-Titles to now play in, but the guide through the most important matters of that world is the X-Men main title, which mostly features stand-alone episodes, making it more accessible than basically any other title on this list.Relevant Trades: No matter what you do, you’ll need to read House of X / Powers of X HC to gain a base understanding of the new X-Men status quo. Past that, you have two options. You can read just the collected issues of the X-Men flagship title when that collection hits in April, or you can read trades that collect the entire line, issue by issue, with Dawn of X 1, Dawn of X 2, and Dawn of X 3.Special Note: While the X-Men flagship title is the only true must read and the main event here, basically all of the auxiliary titles have been strong too (with one exception). The solo titles for Wolverine and Cable both exceeded my expectations. Past that, Marauders is a really well done mutants-at-sea (hear me out!) comic that tackles the geopolitical economic implications of the new status quo, while X-Force is very good too and does the same for national security. X-Men/Fantastic Four has the best small story of the bunch (it’s about family strife because young Franklin Richards is a mutant), while the other must-read title here, to my mind, is Giant-Sized X-Men, which is an artist showcase miniseries that sees lead X-Men writer Jonathan Hickman collaborating with some of the publisher’s best superhero artists. 2. Immortal HulkWriter: Al EwingMain Series Artist: Joe BennettMost Recent Issue: Immortal Hulk #32Next Issue: Immortal Hulk #33 is due out March 25Why Is This So Good: While X-Men might be the buzziest franchise at Marvel in 2020, the best individual book is Immortal Hulk. First launched back in June 2018, this is a rare superhero comic that has gotten better and better and better as it has gone. It has a consistent creative team, and it has reached fluidly throughout the Hulk’s long history (all of these characters have long histories now) to find new opportunities to tell haunting stories. Somewhere between an action romp and a horror fest, Immortal Hulk is Marvel’s best individual book in 2020.Relevant Trades: Immortal Hulk Vols. 1 - 6, are all available now, and they will get you right up to Immortal Hulk #303. AvengersWriter: Jason AaronMain Series Artist: Ed McGuinness Most Recent Issue: Avengers #32Next Issue: Avengers #33 is due out Why Is This So Good: Marvel relaunched its flagship team superhero title back in May of 2018, bringing back a lineup that should be familiar to those who mostly just know the Marvel movies (plus also She-Hulk and Ghost Rider). The book got off to a rocky start with a first arc that felt a little bloated and prolonged, but once it found its groove, it’s been stellar ever since. There’s so much going on in this comic, so many good ideas that really play to the inherent absurdities of large-scale superheroics. It’s a great monthly read, and the third best comic at Marvel right now.Relevant Trades: Avengers by Jason Aaron Vols. 1 - 5 will take you up through Avengers #25, with Avengers Vol. 6 due May 6.4. DaredevilWriter: Chip ZdarskyMain Series Artist: Marco ChecchettoMost Recent Issue: Daredevil #19Next Issue: Daredevil #20 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Daredevil is almost always good, so well-built is this character and mythos that roughly a half-dozen writers have done career-best work on the character, including Frank Miller, Ann Nocenti, Brian Michael Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Mark Waid/Chris Samnee, and most recently Charles Soule. The current Chip Zdarsky/Marco Checchetto run is no exception, ranking as one of the best monthly comics at Marvel right now.Relevant Trades: Daredevil by Chip Zdarsky Vols. 1 - 2 will take you up through Daredevil #10, with Daredevil Vol. 3 due out in April.5. Doctor DoomWriter: Christopher CantwellMain Series Artist: Salvador LaroccaMost Recent Issue: Doctor Doom #6Next Issue: Doctor Doom #7 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Christopher Cantwell is such a powerful writer that he’s bringing out the best of Salvador Larocca on this book, which is a tale about Doom confronting a prophecy that under the right circumstances he could save the entire world...but at the same time he’s also being framed for a heinous act of terrorism. This entire series has been fantastic. For a taste of what you’re in for, consider that Doctor Doom #6 earlier this month was like the film Paris, Texas...just with Doom and Kang the Conqueror walking and chatting their way through a desert together. Look, I know how it all sounds but this comic is excellent.Relevant Trades: Doctor Doom Vol. 1 is due March 25, collecting #1 - #56. Ant-ManWriter: Zeb WellsMain Series Artist: Dylan BurnettMost Recent Issue: Ant-Man #3Next Issue: Ant-Man #4 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Look, this series is hilarious...and I don’t even generally like superhero comics that try to be funny. If you don’t believe check out my review of Ant-Man #1 for a longer and (hopefully) more thoughtful argument, and then when you’re done with that check out this weekly feature about some of the funniest panels in Ant-Man #2. If that’s still not enough, let me also advise you that in Ant-Man #3, there’s a scene where Ant-Man refers to Spider-Man as “Captain Dad Joke.” In other words, this book is a blast, and it’s the best light read at Marvel right now. Relevant Trades: None yet7. Marvel’s Teen Superhero ComicsThe Magnificent Ms. MarvelWriter: Saladin AhmedMain Series Artist: Minkyu JungMost Recent Issue: The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #13Next Issue: The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #14 is due out April 1Relevant Trades: Ms. Marvel by Saladin Ahmed Vols. 1 - 2, with 2 due out April 1, collects up through The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #12Miles Morales: Spider-ManWriter: Saladin AhmedMain Series Artist: Javi GarronMost Recent Issue: Miles Morales Spider-Man #16Next Issue: Miles Morales Spider-Man #17 is due out April 1Relevant Trades: Miles Morales Spider-Man Vols. 1 - 2, collects up through #10Why These Are So Good: By having the excellent writer Saladin Ahmed take on Marvel’s two most prominent teen heroes, the publisher has fostered a sort of continuity among its teen line, and it’s working very well. At the same time, writer Eve L. Ewing is coming on to take over the main teen hero team book, Champions, next month with artist Simone Di Meo, and that book features both Miles and Kamala. Ewing did great work on the RiRi Williams Ironheart series that wrapped up last year, giving Marvel’s line of teen titles a very bright future indeed.8. ThorWriter: Donny CatesMain Series Artist: Nic KleinMost Recent Issue: Thor #4Next Issue: Thor #5 is due out April 8Relevant Trades: None yetWhy Is This So Good: I’ve had a bit of a hangover since Jason Aaron concluded his EPIC run with Thor, but this new one by writer Donny Cates and artist Nic Klein has been pretty bombastic (much like Cates work with Thanos that helped him break-out as a star at Marvel). It also gets extra points on our list here today because you can easily pick-up all four issues to date and get caught up with this one quick. Oh, and expect lots of Galactus! If you find yourself like this book, Cates’ run on Venom may be to your liking as well, though I’m not as enamored with that as am with Cates Marvel cosmic stories.Honorable Mentions: Amazing Spider-Man (when not bogged down with crossovers), Black Panther, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Conan the Barbarian, Guardians of the Galaxy, Runaways, Valkyrie: Jane Foster, Venom.This next section is dedicated to recent trade collections newly available in 2020 that more casual Marvel comics readers can pick-up (or buy digitally online) and enjoy today. I highly recommend this entire list, all of which can just be picked up and enthusiastically dove into with little knowledge of anything else going on. There is, it should be noted, some overlap with the trade recommendations noted above, as is to be expected.Black Bolt HCMore InformationHistory of the Marvel Universe - Treasury EditionMore InformationHouse of X / Powers of X HCMore InformationImmortal Hulk Vol. 1 HCMore InformationInvaders Vol. 1 & Vol. 2More Information Vol. 1More Information Vol. 2Ironheart Vol. 1 & Vol. 2More Information Vol. 1More Information Vol. 2Punisher Kill KrewMore InformationFinally, a note about the future...as I pointed out in the intro, we’ll be doing this for a number of other publishers in the months and weeks to come.

      "www.cbr.com10 Comic Genres Matched With Members Of The Justice LeagueOf the DC Heroes that make up the Justice League, which one would represent each major comic genre?The comics industry survives on constantly being innovative. But underneath the crazy storylines, personal and emotional moments, or even the massive action sequences, the foundation of this industry is the genres that these comic titles emulate.RELATED: 10 Forgotten Kids of Justice League MembersThe Justice League, of course, falls into the superhero genre, but each of its members represents a slightly different type of narrative. Over the years there have been a variety of different members of the group, with each bringing a slightly different method of storytelling, or a variation on the tone and atmosphere normally set out in the comics.Batman is known as the world's greatest detective and loves to operate in the shadows. It's not surprising, therefore, that the themes of the noir genre work extremely well with the character.From the crime mystery element, to the grim and shady style of artwork, most Batman stories actually naturally fall into this genre. There was even a comic called Batman Noir, which certainly drives this concept even further.Mythology has a strong holding in comics. The genre is made up of the ancient legends that have defined humanity. Whether it's the focus on the Norse gods Thor and Loki in Marvel, or perhaps the DC Universes' take on the Greek pantheon.Wonder Woman's comics often balance a variety of genres but none more so than mythology. Recent comics even saw the Amazonian warrior visit ancient Aztec gods, with the character highlighting the myths of many ancient civilisations.The space opera is a very specific genre. While it plays on both fantasy and science fiction elements, it also draws into a specific type of drama. It therefore normally features a narrative based on much larger themes of family and ideology.RELATED: 10 Best Justice League Origins, RankedSuperman represents the House of El, who is constantly pitted against the Luthors and the Zods. These factions are distinctive, with heroes like Supergirl helping to make this a true family affair. The stakes are much more than saving the world, but about restoring hope to humanity.There are many heroes within the Justice League that could play into this genre, but none more so than the Green Lantern. Many of his comic book stories actually reflect some of the greatest sci-fi stories.Whether it's the origin of being chosen by some alien society, or perhaps the variety of species and planets within these tales. Each issue feels as if it was developed in the minds of H.G. Wells and Philip K. Dick.There are two variations on the sword genre. There is the sword and sandal piece, which reflects some of the mythological and historical elements of Wonder Woman. Then there is sword and sorcery, which plays closer to that of Merlin and King Arthur.It's fair to say that if Zatanna found herself in Camelot she'd fit right in. Fighting ancient demons, mythical creatures, and dark magic, many of the elements that go into a modern Zatanna story can be traced back to the knights of the round table and other similar motifs.The fantasy genre is a huge influence on the comics industry. While some titles decide to move away from these influences and towards traditional superhero storytelling, Shazam manages to keep coming back to these ideas.RELATED: 5 Justice League Rosters That Could Take Down Thanos (& 5 That Would Get Snapped)It would be easy to turn the Shazam mythology into one of modern sci-fi, yet with the magic, types of villains and the mystical origins involving an old sorcerer all contributing to a unique take on the Captain Marvel character.The horror genre isn't explored often enough in comics. Although the Justice League Dark was created to try and rectify this, the Swamp-Thing character has been defining this category for years.Reflective of the Hollywood monster movies, Swamp-Thing explored the humanity within the creature, stepping on the toes of many other horror based projects and highlighting the narrative gap in the market. The character represents what the genre is at its core.DC doesn't tend to play into the comedy genre often. While some of their characters are funny, there are very few ongoing titles that could actually be considered to be a part of this category.Despite this, Plastic Man is the perfect example of a character, that from his power set to his personality, absolutely embodies this genre. He is often the relief on the team and the wackier design makes him a great embodiment of that comedic tone.The western genre can be applied to a couple of different characters. While an obvious choice is Jonah Hex, he is not considered to be an official member of a Justice League team. Batman could be seen as a gunslinger (without the weapons of course).But the Green Arrow might be one of the few heroes who truly links to the western spirit. The lone vigilante takes his justice seeking job very seriously. His motorbike is his steed, and his bow and arrow his gun. He's been in many shootouts and reflects a lot of western imagery.There's been a few different versions of the Question, but some have served on the Justice League and others have teamed up alongside them, as part of the Birds of Prey.The Question is an extremely talented detective. If DC is looking for a crime thriller story then The Question is the natural hero to write about. They are hellbent of getting to the truth of the matter and also occasionally plays on the noir themes discussed previously.NEXT: DC: Ranking The Top 10 Members Of The Justice League By PersonalityPolitics graduate, freelance writer and all around film geek.

      "Best Comics of 2022 (So Far): Marvel ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — We’ve reached (roughly) the 1/4 through the year mark (very roughly), and as such, we’re starting our annual tradition: ranking the best comics of 2022 (so far). Each Friday through the end of the month, we’ll have a new list. Today’s is the best comics of 2022 — Marvel Comics. On the Fridays to come, we’ll soon have lists as well for DC Comics, Image Comics, and just generally indie comics.And hey, we’re also doing things just a little bit differently this year. I’m going to stick with these lists and update them in real time as more books arrive, right up through October. So if you like what you find here, make sure to bookmark it and check back periodically through the rest of the year. Anyway! The best comics of 2022 Marvel are below…enjoy!1. Iron ManWriter: Christopher CantwellPrimary Artist: CafuMost Recent Trade: Iron Man, Vol. 2 - Books of Korvac IIWhy This Is So Good: Holy cow, where to start? This current run of Iron Man — which is a manageable two trades long at the time of this writing — is the ideal of what I want from my superhero comics. First and foremost, it’s character driven, like all of Christopher Cantwell’s comics tend to be. Rather than deploying a quip machine Tony Stark like we see in the movies, this book really looks at Tony’s psychology, drawing it instead from his long history in the comics. It tackles his roots as Iron Man, his drinking problem, his troubles with relationships, and it tackles it well. There’s plenty of big superhero fighting (we’ll get into it) and sci-fi hi jinx (we’ll get into that too) in these pages, but it’s all driven by emotional complexity.That said, in between that intense examination, it’s also a total romp of a sci-fi superhero adventure comic that draws from deep cuts in Marvel continuity. We see Tony assembling a B (or C…or even D) list team of superheroes, we see him taking them to space, and we see him squaring off with an equally-matched villain from the Avengers past in ways that will give you vibes of Star Trek: The Original Series. It’s really smart and hard to predict, and it’s the best use of Iron Man I’ve seen in a comic in years, if not decades. Finally, it’s all brought to life by Cafu, who has a true knack for nailing the big moments here, the giant explosions, and larger-than-life squaring off between titans. Cafu can do that stuff, for sure, but in this comic he’s also demonstrated a real knack for action storytelling choreography, making big fights clear in a way that heightens the stakes. Simply put, this is just a very good comic, one that delivers an experience with superhero characters that’s so complex and steeped in ideas, it would be hard to pull off in any other medium. Please please please read this book.Other Relevant Trades: Iron Man, Vol. 1 TPB2. The ThingWriter: Walter MosleyPrimary Artist: Tom ReillyMost Recent Trade: Pre-order The Thing: Next Big Thing, due out August 23, 2022Why This Is So Good: The first thing that is likely to grab you in this six-part story centered on the Fantastic Four’s The Thing, is the artwork. Tom Reilly (who is getting ready to do a similar limited series starring Ant Man Men) has some of the cleanest linework in all of superhero comics. There’s something in both his character designs and storytelling that is likely to remind you of The Thing’s creator, Jack Kirby. Just an excellent love of the medium and the creative eye to do it justice. It’s really astounding work.And when paired with novelist Walter Mosley’s clear love for the character? Well, the results are fantastic. This series is an absolute blast from start to finish, one that captures the self-aware absurdity of superhero comics perfectly, without at all looking down on them and instead preferring to just have some fun (although not without the conflict and drama). That’s what this book delivers. It’s smart, it’s funny, it’s engaging, and it feels truly special. I can’t recommend it enough.Other Relevant Trades: The Thing Classic, Vol. 1 - Digital / Physical; The Thing Classic, Vol. 2 - Digital / Physical3. DaredevilWriter: Chip ZdarskyPrimary Artist: Marco ChecchettoMost Recent Trade: Daredevil by Chip Zdarsky, Vol. 7 Lockdown - Physical / DigitalWhy This Is So Good: If there is one thing that Marvel Comics has consistently done well over the years, it’s to make sure that Daredevil is always a top-tier superhero comics reading experience. Often times, this means that the book is eliciting career-best work from its creative team (see Frank Miller, Ann Nocenti, Brian Michael Bendis & David Mack/Alex Maleev, Mark Waid & Chris Samnee, the list goes on…). This is certainly true of the current run of Daredevil.The run by Chip Zdarsky (soon to be the writer of the flagship Batman title for DC Comics) and artist Marco Checcetto, has been a slow-burning and complex examination of the functions of laws, authorities, and power structures in a modern city. Checchetto’s artwork is moody and engaging, with more than subtle hints of classic noir. And Zdarsky is making plenty of excellent choices with the story, which centers thematically on the nature of accountability. It’s a long run, one of the longest on our Best Comics of 2022 - Marvel Comics list, but it’s well worth the investment to get caught up now. The seven trade collections that are currently available lead right into the currently-ongoing Devil’s Reign event story.Other Relevant Trades: Vol 1 - Physical / Digital; Vol 2 - Physical / Digital; Vol 3 - Physical / Digital; Vol 4 - Physical / Digital; Vol 5 - Physical / Digital; and Vol 6 - Physical / Digital4. SabretoothWriter: Victor LaVallePrimary Artist: Leonard KirkMost Recent Trade: Pre-order Sabretooth - The Adversary, due out August 9, 2022Why This Is So Good: Novelist Victor LaValle brings his keen sensibility for horror that speaks to our times to the line of X-Men comics, and none too soon. As of this writing, the X-Men books are sort of stuck in an in-between place spanning the departure of House of X/Powers of X mastermind, Jonathan Hickman, and a new era that will spring from the ideas he and his collaborators have shaped over the past two years or so. Yet, as we await that new era, perhaps the best new comic of current era has arrived, in which LaValle and his collaborators take aim at a society that is striving to be a utopia…while still throwing its members into a prison, of sorts. Many writers have spun ideas out of the Krakoa concept that Hickman set up, but this is far and away the most intriguing. And all you need to jump into it is to have read House of X/Powers of X (see link below…).Other Relevant Trades: House of X/Powers of X HC5. Moon KnightWriter: Jed MacKayPrimary Artist: Alessandro CappuccioMost Recent Trade: Moon Knight, Vol. 1 - The Midnight Mission - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: If Daredevil is consistently the favorite, prestige son of Marvel Comics, Moon Knight is his more mysterious cousin, a place where creators have often gone to tell weirdo stories that challenge perceptions and maybe even deliberately confuse. This current run is not as disorienting as others have been as of late, but it’s still a really good use of the character to take a romp through the Marvel Universe’s street level instances of monsters and the occult. The artwork is suitably moody, and writer Jed MacKay is a natural at telling accessible and fast-moving superhero stories. If you have had your interest in this character sparked by the upcoming TV show, the current comic also has a lot to offer.Other Relevant Trades: See our guide on where to start with Moon Knight6. Miles Morales: Spider-ManWriter: Saladin AhmedPrimary Artist: Michele BandiniMost Recent Trade: Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 7 Beyond - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: This is the best Spider-Man comic right now. Granted, we have a new Amazing Spider-Man #1 launching in April, but for the moment, Miles Morales: Spider-Man is definitely where you want to get your Spider-Man fix. It’s a Spider-Man comic that is taking risks and going to new places, adding characters and introducing villains that all feel fresh and interesting. It’s also liable to remind readers of the beloved teenage Spider-Man years, the struggles to date and go to school and balance being a hero with family. Like Daredevil, it’s one of the longer runs on the best comics of 2022 Marvel list, but the creative team expertly playing the long game with the ideas here makes this one well worth the lengthy trip.Other Relevant Trades: Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 1 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 2 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 3 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 4 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 5 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 6 Digital / Physical7. Ghost RiderWriter: Benjamin PercyPrimary Artist: Cory SmithMost Recent Trade: Ghost RiderWhy This Is So Good: You can read all about it in my recent Ghost Rider #1 review, but I was caught off guard with how much I ended up liking this comic. In brief, it’s a simple and chilling horror comic with touches of the characters mythos throughout. From page one, this book is doing so many interesting things with tone and minimalism and ambiance, and it really carries throughout the entirety of the over-sized first chapter. If this comic continues to be this good as it gets deeper into its run (be forewarned, we so far only have the first issue), than I can definitely see it’s position changing (and for the better) later in the year on this very list of the best comics of 2022 Marvel edition. Anyway, highly recommend checking out Ghost Rider #1, which you just might enjoy even if you’re not traditionally a fan of the character.8. Captain MarvelWriter: Kelly ThompsonPrimary Artist: Jacopo CamagniMost Recent Trade: Captain Marvel Vol. 7 Last of the Marvels - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: The third (and final) long run on our list, Captain Marvel has been a sneakily (is that a word?) excellent title since its start, actually (for my money) getting better after it found its footing with its earliest arcs. It’s doing a lot of interesting things with its supporting cast, and, increasingly, with the Marvel cosmic mythos that surrounds Carol Danvers. If you’re interested in this character, it’s a great book to really sink your teeth into, and I think one that’s relatively friendly for folks who haven’t read too many other Captain Marvel comics.Other Relevant Trades: Captain Marvel Vol. 1 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 2 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 3 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 4 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 5 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 6 - Digital / PhysicalThis section is dedicated to recent trade collections newly available in 2022.

      "50 Best NBA players of 2022: Giannis leads the charge as injuries impact othersAs the season continues to heat up, the Best NBA players are rising to the top. Making big impacts. Let’s take a look at the top 50 so far:Note: The article was originally written by Jarrod Castillo, since updated by the Sportsnaut team.Consistency has obviously been an issue for the 20-year-old Edwards since Minnesota made him the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Despite this, the flashes this Georgia product has shown thus far in his career makes him a top-50 NBA player. The kid is averaging nearly 22 points per game as a sophomore and has seen both his effective field goal and three-point percentages increase a ton since his rookie campaign.The other half of the vaunted “Splash Bros.,” Thompson just returned to action after a two-year hiatus. While he’s been limited in minutes as the Warriors look to get him up to speed, we have not seen too much of a drop-off in production. The three-time champion is averaging 18 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists. He’s also shooting 36.1% from distance while continuing to play elite-level defense. We’re intrigued to see how Thompson looks once he’s playing his full 38 minutes per game (27.9 thus far).Acquired from Sacramento during February’s NBA trade deadline, Haliburton is among the best young point guards in the NBA. In limited action with the Pacers, he’s averaging 17.2 points to go with 9.5 assists while shooting 41% from three-point range. Having recently turned 22, he’s still not close to his prime. The sky is almost literally the limit for the Iowa State product.Related: NBA schedule and fantasy basketball picksA first-round pick of the Nets back in 2017, Allen displayed flashes of brilliance in Brooklyn before heading to Cleveland in the James Harden trade to open the 2020-21 season. Since joining the Cavaliers, he’s been an elite force for this up-and-coming squad. That includes Allen averaging 16.1 points and 10.8 rebounds on 67.7% shooting. He also ranks eighth in the NBA this season in win shares. That’s insane.One of the more surprising success stories from last season was Jerami Grant having a fantastic performance for the rebuilding Detroit Pistons. He very nearly nabbed the Most Improved Player award last season averaging career-highs in points, assists, and free throw percentage. While injuries have impacted Grant this season, he’s still one of the better two-way players in the game.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA Playoff and title predictions One of the most-underrated acquisitions during the 2020 offseason, Christian Wood proved to be a godsend for a Rockets team that will have to continue finding an identity moving forward. Wood had a tremendous breakout season last year and has since carried over that success into this season. He’s averaging 18.1 points and 10.1 rebounds. The question now is whether Wood fits in long-term with the Rockets after months of trade speculation.It was about this time last year that Collin Sexton was seen as the face of a rebuilding Cavaliers squad. Boy, how a calendar year changes things. Cleveland is a legit playoff contender back east and one of the most-surprising squads in the game. For his part, Garland just earned his first-ever All-Star appearance. For good reason. The former No. 5 pick from Vanderbilt is averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, field goal percentage and effective field goal percentage. Did we mention he’s only 22?In the latter half of last season, Miles Bridges began to show signs that he was ready to have a breakout year coming into this season. In his last 19 games of the year, he averaged 20.3 points shooting 52% from the field and 6.8 rebounds. Thus far this season, Bridges is averaging 19.9 points, 7 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 48.7% shooting this season.Pretty much the centerpiece in the trade that sent Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers ahead of the 2019-20 season, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has morphed into a star and leader for the rebuilding Thunder. It’s pretty darn shocking what we’ve seen him do thus far in OKC. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, SGA is averaging 24.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 5.9 assists.Related: NBA MVP rankings for 2022 It’s going to be interesting to see how Simmons pans out in Brooklyn after the blockbuster trade from Philadelphia. He’s fallen down our list of the best NBA players big time after sitting out the entire season with the 76ers and following a disastrous playoff performance in 2020-21. Even then, we’re talking about one of the best defensive players in the game and a dude who can contribute big time. You don’t average 15.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.7 assists on 56% shooting over four seasons without being pretty good.De’Aaron Fox has proven himself to be among the best NBA players at the point guard position. That’s magnified by the fact Fox has improved in each of his four seasons. Unfortunately, the Sacramento Kings have not been in the postseason since 2006. With Fox’s numbers taking a big dip through 74 games and the Kings falling to 13th in the West, their chances of making it back to the playoffs are not likely.After a season in which he was named the NBA’s Most Improved Player leading to a well-deserved contract extension, Randle has seen his production decline big time. It led to some rumors heading into February’s NBA trade deadline. Since then, the forward has picked it up. Randle is averaging 24.4 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists since the start of February. He’s coming around.While all of the buzz surrounding the New Orleans Pelicans is based around Zion Williamson, not enough is said about the player that Brandon Ingram has developed into. Ingram signed a max contract extension ahead of the 2020-21 campaign, Ingram is now continuing to play at a high level. So far this year, he is averaging 22.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists. With Williamson still sidelined to a knee injury, Ingram has taken over as the face of the franchise in NOLA.Ayton, 23, has morphed into one of the more reliable centers in the NBA. He’s doing so for a championship-contending Suns squad. Since the start of last season, he’s averaging 17.3 points and 10.1 rebounds on an otherworldly 64.6% shooting. The question now is whether Phoenix will award him with a max contract as a restricted free agent during the summer.The Milwaukee Bucks took a massive gamble in their blockbuster trade for Jrue Holiday. In the end, it paid off in droves for the Bucks as Holiday played a huge role in the team winning the NBA championship over the Phoenix Suns. Holiday gets a lot of respect around the league as one of the best perimeter defenders in the game today with even Kevin Durant praising his talents on JJ Redick’s podcast. His impact continues to be felt for Milwaukee as they are legit contenders to repeat in 2021-22.Former Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green may not get much recognition due in part to him not being a prolific scorer, but he is arguably one of the best playmaking bigs the NBA has to offer. He helped the Warriors to a hot start to the 2021-22 season before going down to a back injury. Put it this way. Golden State is 29-9 in the 38 games Green has played in this season. It’s a mere 19-16 when he sits.Since given the opportunity to be the full-time starter in Toronto, Pascal Siakam has shown that he is among the best power forwards in the league today. However, a torn labrum suffered late last season prevented him making a major impact early during the 2021-22 campaign. Boy, has Siakam turned it around since. He’s averaging 22 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists on 48.8% shooting this season.A former No. 1 pick, the 26-year-old Towns has lived up to his end of the bargain on the offensive end. He’s having the best overall performance of his career this season, averaging 24.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists. He’s also shooting 40.7% from distance while ranking fifth in offensive win shares. That seems pretty good.In highly unfortunate fashion, Jamal Murray went down to a torn ACL 48 games into the 2020-21 season. That came after the 2019-20 NBA Playoff hero averaged 21.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists 41% from three-point range. Unfortunately for him and the Denver Nuggets, there is no timetable for his return depriving fans from seeing his and the team’s development.Related: 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year rankingsA throwback to bigs of the past, Nikola Vucevic has been slowly expanding his offensive game and it is paying dividends for a Chicago Bulls team that is on a fast rise to contention in the Eastern Conference. Vucevic has not truly been able to leave his mark on the Bulls so far this year though he is averaging a double-double with 18 points and 11.3 rebounds. He will get his chance to make more of an impact for Chicago moving forward.It’s not that Murray wasn’t a good player earlier in his career with San Antonio. Rather, it’s all about him taking his game to the next level since being the primary focus on offense. With DeMar DeRozan in Chicago, Murray has excelled in a lead role. He’s averaging 20.9 points to go with 8.3 rebounds and 9.3 assists while leading the league in steals at 2 per game. Murray ranks 19th in the NBA in defensive win shares and 10th in value over replacement. He’s a first-time All-Star. You do the math.Coming off a season in which he became the first Charlotte Hornet to win the Rookie of the Year since Emeka Okafor in 2005, Lamelo Ball has not become a victim of the sophomore slump so far. He is averaging 19.8 points, 7.3 assists and 6.8 rebounds. We’re talking about a first-time All-Star who is still only 20 years old. There’s a ton of untapped potential here.While Khris Middleton gets a bad reputation for being inconsistent, he is arguably one of the most underrated players in the NBA. After an eight-game absence due to health and safety protocols, Middleton has finally started to find his footing for the Bucks this season. For the season, he is averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists. Though, Middleton’s shooting numbers are down from the previous six seasons. That has to be seen as concerning.An amazing defensive player, the “Stifle Tower” has shown that he can stop almost anyone at the rim. Gobert’s offense needs work if he is to stay on the court against smaller, faster teams. But as long as he plays his role, he’ll be fine. After a second straight playoff loss with the Utah Jazz, there’s some concern over Gobert’s relationship with star teammate Donovan Mitchell. It will be interesting to watch if Utah is booted from the postseason prematurely once again.Acquired by Sacramento in the blockbuster Tyrese Haliburton trade, Sabonis remains one of the most-skilled bigs in the game. The two-time All-Star is averaging 19.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists since the start of the 2019-20 campaign. Unfortunately, issues on defense keep Sabonis limited on our list of best NBA players right now.Probably the best ball-handler of all-time, Kyrie Irving’s mastery with a basketball is undeniable. He can score 50 on any given night and drop any defender that’s in front of him. He’ll be able to resume playing home games soon with New York’s COVID-19 mandates changing but has only suited up in 20 outings this season. When Irving is dialed in, he’s as dominant as they come.The 28-year-old Anthony Davis has been a two-way presence since being the first pick back in 2012. Davis has been criticized for not living up to expectations of being one of the top-10 players in the NBA. While his numbers don’t look bad on the surface averaging 23.1 points on 53.7% shooting, he’s now an injury-plagued enigma and has struggled to remain healthy consistently.Jaylen Brown has teamed up with Jayson Tatum to form an elite young wing duo in Boston. The former No. 3 pick has proven former GM Danny Ainge right in refusing to include him in trades for the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the past. After some struggles earlier this season, Brown has picked it up recently. He’s averaging 23.2 points and 6.0 rebounds on 46.6% shooting. Brown also remains a legitimate two-way threat, as his defense continues to improve on an annual basis.No longer just a dunker, LaVine has improved in almost every other facet of his game from his shooting averages to his per-game totals. Only 26, LaVine has a lot of time to improve other facets of his game to become one of the better all-around players in the NBA. In a year that could see him make the playoffs for the first time in his eight-year career, Lavine is flourishing averaging 24.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists.Related: Ranking 2021-22 NBA defensesSpeaking of max contract extensions, Bam Adebayo re-upped with the Heat as his talents continue to flourish in South Beach. Coming off a season in which the Miami Heat being bounced in the first round of the playoffs, they could be primed for a second NBA Finals in three years with a now revamped roster. Despite missing games to injury earlier this season, Bam has returned to be his dominant self.Since coming into the league in 2017, Mitchell has proven to be a fast-rising star in the NBA. The 25-year-old is a nightly 20-4-4 threat and even as the focal point in the offense, his percentages have stayed consistent in his three years in the league. If he’s able to keep producing, it’s not out of the equation that Mitchell will become a top-10 player.Maybe one of the best offensive players in NBA history, Harden has shown that he can lead a team as the No. 1 option on that end of the court. However, the aforementioned rule changes for “foul hunting” seem to have affected his performance. Now that Harden has joined Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, the hope is that he’s going to return to form. Time will tell on that front, but he looked sharp in his debut.Each year, Jayson Tatum continues to get better and better the more he plays the role of the number one option on offense for the Boston Celtics. The competition in the Eastern Conference is thicker than it’s been in a long time. Tatum is doing his very best to put Boston in strong playoff standing, averaging 27 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists.No doubt one of the best clutch shot makers in recent history, the 31-year-old Damian Lillard definitely knows what time it is when it comes to the game clock. It’s “Dame Time.” Sadly, Lillard is likely lost for the remainder of the season to injury and saw his production decrease before being sidelined. He was averaging six-year lows in PPG, RPG and APG while shooting just 32% from distance. At 31, have we seen the best from Dame already?Even without a three-point shot, the 32-year-old Demar DeRozan has found a way to stay effective. An excellent mid-range shooter, he improved his rebounding and passing pretty much every season. Now a member of the Chicago Bulls after a blockbuster sign-and-trade, DeRozan has played a major role in the team being a contender in the Eastern Conference going forward currently leading the team in scoring with 27.6 points on 50.5% shooting. He also ranks 10th in win shares and seventh in offensive win shares. That’s enough for DeRozan to jump way up the board in our most-recent best NBA players list.After leading the Memphis Grizzlies to their first postseason since 2017, Ja Morant looks to take his team to the next level with a fantastic effort again this season. He is averaging 27.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists. He also has Memphis with the second-best record in the Association at 50-23.One of the few truly elite two-way players in the league, George is a terror on both ends of the court. He can drop 20-25 points on a nightly basis while also shutting down the opposing team’s best player. George earned a lot of people’s respect in the playoffs last season nearly leading the Clippers to the NBA Finals despite being without Kawhi Leonard for a large majority of Los Angeles’. Unfortunately, George currently joins Leonard in being sidelined to injury.The 32-year-old Butler seems to have finally found a home in Miami. Butler has embraced the Heat’s winning culture with great success thus far and that could lead be amplified this year as the Heat have a new and improved team thanks to a wealth of new additions. Butler has helped his team remain a top threat, posting 21.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.7 steals with the Heat in sole possession of first place in the East.Arguably the most surprising team to start the season has been the Washington Wizards opening up the year with a 5-1 record. A huge reason for the teams’ success was the play of their dynamic guard Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, Beal is now lost for the remainder of the season with his future in D.C. firmly up in the air.Stardom. That’s what we saw from the 24-year-old Devin Booker during Phoenix’s shocking run to the NBA Finals last season. Booker is looking to build on what was a spectacular postseason with the difference this year being he will be the hunted not the hunter. Thus far for the star two-guard and Co., that has been the case. Booker has led this squad to an NBA-best 59-14 record. He’s also averaging north of 25 points per game while shooting 37.5% from distance.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA power rankings Chris Paul demonstrated that he still has gas left in the tank during an absolutely brilliant 2020-21 regular season for the Phoenix Suns. Paul is one of the best leaders the NBA has today and that was on full display during the Suns’ playoff run last season. As his career winds down, Paul will look to get Phoenix back to the promised land capturing the NBA championship that has eluded him. He has been a huge catalyst for the Suns success this season, ranking ninth in the NBA in win shares and sixth in defensive plus-minus.As we saw in the playoffs last year, Trae Young is shaping up to be the next shooter with limitless range. Trae is making a name for himself as not only a great shooter but one of the brightest stars in the league today. Not only that, but he is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast that allow him to flex his amazing playmaking skills. While things have not gone the best for the Hawks this season, Young’s earned another All-Star appearance and is a legit star out there.At only 22, Doncic is doing things for the Dallas Mavericks that haven’t been done since LeBron James. Since the start of his sophomore campaign, Doncic is averaging 28.2 points, 8.8 rebounds and 8.7 assists. He’s earned three consecutive All-Star appearances and is a downright dominant force on offense. This dude has Hall of Fame written all over him.Last season, Kawhi Leonard was a huge catalyst in the Los Angeles Clippers reaching their first Conference Finals in franchise history during last season’s playoffs.  Unfortunately, he was unable to reap the benefits of all his hard work as he was injured during the semifinal round forced to miss the rest of the playoffs due to a partially torn ACL. That news is bad enough but it could be even worse as it could force him to miss the entire 2021-2022 season. Hopefully this is not the case and we are able to see him back on the court prior to the start of the 2022 playoffs.Despite the Nets also having stars such as Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons, Kevin Durant proves he is among the best of the best every time he steps out on the court. Sadly, his season has been derailed by a sprained MCL in his knee that has caused the future Hall of Famer to miss 27 games. How important is KD to the Nets? They are 8-19 in those 27 games. Brooklyn is 30-16 when Durant plays.LeBron James has been accused of being selfish because he has clearly found the fountain of youth but will not let his peers know where it is. He is now 37 years old and continues to show he has many, many years left in his career. LBJ has two 50-point games in his last nine contests in which he’s averaged 35.6 PPG and is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.The often-injured Joel Embiid is now among the best NBA players in the game right now. That’s not hyperbole. We’re talking about the most-dominant big man since Dwight Howard was in his prime. Embiid has 25 30-point games since mid-December.Last season, Stephen Curry put up what might have been the best individual season of his career but it was not enough to lift the Golden State Warriors into the playoffs. This year, the Warriors have returned Klay Thompson from injury and continue to give Steph a strong supporting cast. Despite some recent struggles, the two-time NBA MVP is still averaging 25.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 6.3 assists on 38% shooting from distance. He’s also improved a whole heck of a lot on defense.A good argument could be made that reigning MVP Nikola Jokic has solidified himself as the best big man in the NBA today. The three-time All-Star is only 27 but is already making a name for himself as the most dynamic center the NBA has ever seen. He can easily put up 20-10 with seven assists as the focal point of the Nuggets’ offense. Jokic’s production has not stopped as he is averaging some ridiculous numbers in 2021-22 (26.2 PPG, 13.6 RPG, 8.0 APG).After an incredible performance in the 2021 NBA Finals, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to their first championship in 50 years, Giannis Antetokounmpo has shown no signs of letting off the gas during the 2021-2022 NBA season. He’s just as consistent and dominating as they come. Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, he’s averaging 28.3 points, 11.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists on 55% shooting. Yes, he’s the top NBA player right now and is still just 27 years old. Let that sink in.Share:  \n",

      "Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2020-21 season?\n",
      "A new season means new player rankings.As always, this is a collaborative effort, with eight members of our NBA.com Global Staff submitting their list of who they believe are the 30-best players heading into the 2020-21 season. We then used a point system to come up with the following list.The last time we did this was after the Los Angeles Lakers were crowned champions of the 2019-20 season. Not much has changed since then thanks to a shorter-than-normal offseason, but that doesn't mean our ranking isn't different, because we've included Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving this time, three top-30 players who didn't crack our last list due to season-ending injuries.The only notable player not included this time: Klay Thompson, who is expected to miss the entire 2020-21 season with a torn Achilles.With all that in mind, onto the list. \n",
      "Coming up with a top-30 is harder than you'd think.Here are some notable players who just missed the cut:Of those players, Westbrook, Middleton, Ingram, Porzingis, Fox and Russell were the only ones to receive votes from our NBA.com Staff heading into 2020-21.Additionally, Middleton, Westbrook and McCollum made our last top-30 list. Middleton ranked 21st, Westbrook ranked 22nd and McCollum ranked 28th. \n",
      "Highest rank: 8Lowest rank: 10Lillard put the NBA on notice in the season restart, carrying the Blazers to the playoffs with averages of 37.6 points and 9.6 assists on .497/.436/.888 shooting splits over their eight seeding games, earning him Bubble MVP.With a better supporting cast this season, Lillard could work his way into the MVP discussion if the Blazers sneak their way into the top four of the Western Conference this season. \n",
      "Highest rank: 7Lowest rank: 10Arguably the best offensive player in the NBA, Harden has led the league in scoring in three consecutive seasons, peaking in 2018-19 with 36.1 points per game. Say what you want about his postseason history, but the Rockets have made the playoffs eight straight seasons with Harden at the helm, giving them the longest active streak in the NBA. \n",
      "Highest rank: 7Lowest rank: 10The way Jokic ended last season sure made everyone forget how he started it. He took his game to another level in the playoffs yet again, leading the Nuggets to the Western Conference Finals with 24.4 points, 9.8 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game.Is there any question as to who the best centre in the league is anymore? \n",
      "Highest rank: 6Lowest rank: 11A six-time All-Star, three-time champion, two-time MVP and one-time scoring champion ... Curry's resume speaks for itself. The question with him is health. After missing all but five games last season with a broken hand, Golden State's hope of returning to the playoffs this season in a crowded Western Conference hinges on Curry staying on the court. \n",
      "Highest rank: 6Lowest rank: 11In his sophomore season, Doncic posted 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists per game. According to Stathead, only two players in NBA history have ever posted those numbers before.Those players? Russell Westbrook and Oscar Robertson.Doncic followed that up by breaking a number of records in his first taste of postseason basketball.Luka Doncic in his first playoff run:- 31.0 points per game- 9.8 rebounds per game- 8.7 assists per game - Most points in a playoff debut- 2 triple-doubles- 40/15/10 game (3rd ever)- 1 walk-off game winner- Youngest player with a playoff game-winnerHe's 21 years old. pic.twitter.com/tlzhZfhWeQHe's only 21, but Doncic is well on his way towards being an all-time great. \n",
      "Highest rank: 4Lowest rank: 5The last time we saw Durant, he was arguably the best player in the NBA. Even if he's 90 percent of the player he was prior to tearing his Achilles, he'll likely be worthy of this spot.You have to take everything that happens in preseason with a grain of salt, but Durant's debut with the Nets sure was promising.The comeback is on. 🎥 15 points in the preseason debut for @KDTrey5 🎥 pic.twitter.com/tPywmhuTIN \n",
      "Highest rank: 2Lowest rank: 5Coming off of one of the greatest individual postseason runs in NBA history, we had Leonard as the best player in the league heading into the 2019-20 season. He put together a career year with the Clippers in averaging 27.1 points, 7.1 rebounds and 4.9 rebounds per game, but it all came crumbling down in the playoffs, blowing a 3-1 lead to the Nuggets in the second round.That might've cost Leonard a few spots on this list, but he's still arguably the best two-way player in the league. \n",
      "Highest rank: 2Lowest rank: 4Davis didn't disappoint in his first playoff run with the Lakers. The biggest surprise? His jump shot. After making 34.9 percent of his field goal attempts from midrange during the regular season, Davis shot 49.6 percent from that distance in the playoffs. Davis also improved his 3-point percentage, from 33.0 percent in the regular season to 38.3 percent in the playoffs. If that's a sign of what's to come ... uh oh. \n",
      "Highest rank: 1Lowest rank: 3Not only did Antetokounmpo win his second MVP award last season, he became the third player in NBA history to be named the league's MVP and DPOY in the same season, joining two legends in Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon.Regular season Giannis is arguably the best player in the league, but it's hard to see him taking the top spot until he has more success in the playoffs.  \n",
      "Highest rank: 1Lowest rank: 4Who else were you expecting?We didn't have James as the No. 1 player in the league entering the 2019-20 season, but he proved us and everyone else who doubted him in any way, shape or form wrong last season in leading the Lakers to the championship with averages of 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game in the Finals.James enters his age 36 season ranked ninth all-time in regular season minutes and first all-time in postseason minutes. Father Time should've caught up to him at this point, but he hasn't shown any signs of slowing down.* Not ranked due to injuries.The views on this page do not necessarily represent the views of the NBA or its clubs.\n",

      "The 25 NBA teams with most fansBasketball is one of the most popular sports in the United States, that's why we decided to make a ranking of the NBA teams with most fans. Who's in first place?By Agustin StellaDecember 16, 2020 03:27PM EDT December 16, 2020 03:27PM EDTBy Agustin StellaThe National Basketball Association features only the best teams on earth, filled with world-class players and competitiveness. But what also makes this sport so popular are the diehard and loyal fans, those who stay with their franchises through thick and thin.Needless to say, some teams are easier to root for than others, as they've been used to performing at a high level and dominating the rest of the league. That's why today, based on the numbers shown on Facebook, we made this ranking of the 25 teams with most fans in the NBA.Fans: 1.8 million City: Detroit, MI Championships: 3 Founded: 1941 (as Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons)The Pistons were not always located in Detroit. In fact, the team was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne (Zollner) Pistons, in Indiana.

      "Lakers, LeBron James Lead Lids‘s Jersey Sales for 2021–22 SeasonFan apparel company Lids released its top jerseys sales so far during the 2021–22 NBA season based on each state, and the map was heavily purple and gold for the Lakers and LeBron James.Los Angeles led in jersey sales in 30 states. The Bulls led in the second-most states with eight.There were only seven current NBA players who led jersey sales in a state: James, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young and Jayson Tatum.But some of states that don‘t house a pro basketball franchise purchased some very random jerseys this season.Yao Ming led sales in Montana, far from Houston, where he spent the entirety of his NBA career. Additionally, the Charlotte Hornets then led Montana for team jersey sales. One of the weirdest jersey sale leaders, though, is Mike Bibby in Alabama. Bibby played for six different squads and retired in 2011. So it’s unclear why are Alabamans purchasing his jersey at such a high rate.Surprisingly, the only state that the late Kobe Bryant led for jersey sales was Alaska. Otherwise, retired players led in 14 states. Michael Jordan led in three states (Illinois, Delaware and South Dakota) to be the retired player with the most jersey states led.More NBA Coverage: GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five? By not changing anything at all. With a berth in Qatar on the line in a place the U.S. has never won, it’s all business.The Bucks forward’s block came in a critical moment in the fourth quarter to solidify a 118-116 win.\n",

It is based on the jersey sales on NBAStore.com between March 11th and July 13th, 2021.While we saw basketball at the NBA's biggest stage, several fans donned the Phoenix Suns and Milwaukee Bucks' jerseys. Both finalists finished top five in team merchandise sold. However, the biggest takeaway from the list was the absence of the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic from the top 15.So without further ado, let's look at the ten best-selling NBA jerseys in 2021 so far.Damian Lillard is in tenth spot in the 2021 jersey sales so far. He was eighth this time last year, but was 14th in 2018.Players like Kristaps Porzingis, Lonzo Ball and Klay Thompson fell out of the top-selling jerseys, and Lillard climbed a few spots.

He made an appearance in the exclusive 50-40-90 club, and he did so while averaging 26.9 points per game.Irving is just one of four players in NBA history to average 25+ points and shoot 50-40-90. Irving has seen a climb in his jersey sale numbers, which were 12th in the NBA in the last two seasons.Stephen Curry saw a dip in his jersey sales despite the phenomenal season he just had.Curry has been either first or in the top 3 in jersey sales since 2015, and the Golden State Warriors have been top ten in team merchandise sales because of him. He was ranked third in the 2019-20 NBA season before the pandemic, but after he got injured and the NBA action resumed in Orlando, he slipped down to sixth.Steph Curry's jersey sales are up almost 600% since the first two weeks of last season https://t.co/W9tN1VLq9f pic.twitter.com/xXsr8lFbiFDevin Booker is a superstar in the making.

The state of Texas recognizes that because of him, hundreds of people around the world will wear the word 'Dallas' on their chest. He was ranked second in jersey sales after the bubble restart.Kevin Durant's jersey has been one of the highest-selling jerseys in the NBA for years, no matter which team he plays for.He was ranked seventh in the 2019-20 NBA season.

Be it Kobe Bryant, Durant, Antetokounmpo or Curry, James is always on the podium.

      "Best Marvel Comics of 2019Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansDecember 10, 2019 by Dave 2 Comments 2019 feels like the first year in the last four when Marvel wasn’t still mired in a post-Secret Wars (2015) malaise. While it’s far from a slam dunk, 2018’s “Fresh Start” helped Marvel feel less aimless and more consistent. Plus, the 2019 event initiatives are genuinely exciting, whether it’s War of the Realms, Jonathan Hickmen’s X-Men, or Absolute Carnage.Below you’ll find my favorite Marvel Comics of 2019!Marvel Fresh StartAge of X-ManWar of the RealmsComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!House of X / Hickman’s X-MenAbsolute CarnageIt took three issues for me to become a believer, but the moment Nnedi Okorafor and Leanordo Romero strapped Shuri in to pilot Groot I knew the series was willing to tap into the sci-fi oddities that would set it above the rest.Post MCU Black Panther Shuri is destined for greatness, so here’s hoping Marvel Comics can lead the charge rather than follow the MCU’s lead again.I am deeply skeptical of writers and artists touching the character of Thanos unless they’re named (creator) Jim Starlin. This irrational stance has become less tenable over the past three years as the likes of Jeff Lemire, Mike Deodato, Donny Cates, Geoff Shaw, and now Tini Howard and Ariel Olivetti all clearly displayed skill and promise with the mad titan.“Zero Sanctuary” had the potential for a particularly egregious 2019 Avengers: Endgame tie-in, but instead flashes back to Thanos finding Gamora and bringing her aboard his pirate ship of mercenary and Black Order. It’s an intriguing look at the early days of these characters that are so well-established in the Marvel Universe today, and connects effortlessly to Starlin’s own stories from the cosmic glory days of the mid 1970’s.I’m consistently more into the Ta-Nehisi Coates era of Black Panther than many comics critics, and many of the same critiques can be levied against Coates early run on Captain America. Coates likes to take his time and build not only worlds but philosophies and themes. This can lead to books that feel like they progress too slowly or aren’t going anywhere, but more often than not – for me at least – it adds though-provoking layers of conversation between the respite of Captain America v Taskmaster.Since launch as part of “Fresh Start,” Cap by Coates and Leinil Francis Yu feels back, clearly paying tribute to the work of Brubaker and Epting while responding in earnest to the controversial events of Secret Empire. It’s this last piece that I particularly respect, as Coates is truly engaged with unpacking the all too pertinent metaphor behind the debasement of the American dream. Blended together with Yu’s consistent status as one of the best Marvel artists for over a decade, and Captain America is one of 2019’s best.As a huge fan of Jason Aaron’s extended Thor run, I’ve wanted to meet War of the Realms with more rapturous excitement, but instead find it merely “good.” Like a lot of The Mighty Thor, the art team of Russell Dautermann and Matt Wilson frequently transform the mundane into the transcendent, and elevate this event to an easy “best since Secret Wars” pedestal.The Donny Cates written Venom would likely have shot further up my top 10 but for the notable descent into War of the Realms tie-in purgatory. It’s like considering Kawhai Leonard for MVP – maybe he’d have gotten votes without the commitment to managing his minutes you know? (And to extend the parallel it follows that Absolute Carnage won the NBA Finals of event opening issues as a result.)Venom has been building to the events of Absolute Carnage since launch alongside Marvel Fresh Start in May 2018, and the payoff is generally worth it. Ryan Stegman and JP Mayer deliver some of the absolute best work in their careers in the main event issues, particularly the oversized issue one which is seriously one of the best event openers I’ve read across either of the Big 2.Absolute Carnage actually helped Venom course correct as well, setting the stage for a big 2020 for everyone in the book, from Eddie Brock to his son Dylan to The Maker!While it will go down as the weird Marvel event that bridged the gap between X-Men before and after Jonathan Hickman, Age of X-Man has been consistently interesting. The event commits with admirable audacity to really exploring the concepts of Utopia and isolation, with the “Xtremists” five issue miniseries finding the most fertile ground for extended metaphor.This is my first time reading an extended stretch of comics by writer Leah Williams, and her work developing a forbidden romance between The Blob and Psylocke is genuinely remarkable. If you’re going to explore any of the Age of X-Man miniseries, the Xtremists is my favorite by far.Marvel’s Dawn of X is a fascinating new era for the X-Men, and Gerry Duggan and Matteo Lolli’s Marauders is my favorite early series in this World of X.Ask me what happened in Silver Surfer Black and off hand I’ll likely mutter something even less intelligible than usual about Knull vs the Silver Surfer and the birth of Galactus. Ask what I think of the 5 issue miniseries, though, and I’ll just start screaming “TRADD MOORE” until you politely tell the authorities “No, I don’t know him.”Silver Surfer Black is an astonishingly gorgeous work with Moore dreaming up cosmic realms without boundaries, and a liquid streak of Norrin Radd like I haven’t enjoyed him since Slott and Allred wrapped up their run. This is a roadmap for the ambition artists should strive towards on any true Marvel Cosmic work.If you had told me at the start of 2019 that an Invaders comic would be among my favorite Marvel books of the year, I’d have spit on your crocs. Harsh but true, as I’ve never had much affinity for Marvel’s WWII relics (unless told via flashback during the Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting Captain America days).Chip Zdarsky and Butch Guice change that with an Invaders story centered around the recent heel turn of Namor the Sub-Mariner. This is without question my favorite use of Namor since the Hickman Avengers days, and the book does excellent work blending Marvel history with present day threats without swelling up and rotting on the shore.Given how good it’s been since launch, I find myself taking Runaways for granted far too often. Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka have recaptured all the magic of the Brian K. Vaughn and Adrian Alphona creation, really without any missteps along the way.Amazingly, Runaways is also the longest running series on my favorites of 2019 list, which probably says more about Marvel’s constant refreshes than anything, but still, consistency by a creative team!The premise for Spider-Man Life Story is familiar territory (works like George R.R. Martin’s Tom Tudbury stories in Wild Cards are my favorite example of a “realistically” aging Peter Parker), which makes it all the more important that Chip Zdarsky and company execute near perfectly. Each issue of “Life Story” condenses the history of Spider-Man one decade at a time, but in a universe where Peter’s actually in his 50’s by the time the 2000’s roll around.“Life Story” is particularly compelling if you’re familiar with Spidey’s deep comic book history (perhaps through a chronological reading club like My Marvelous Year), but this story will stand on its own for new readers for a good long while.Meet the Skrulls desperately wants to be Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta’s Vision, which can work as either a cruel critique, or a celebration of ambition. I chose to embrace the ambition, and love the sinister spy family tones of the Robbie Williams written five issue miniseries. Meet the Skrulls is particularly impressive given the launch in line with the MCU’s Captain Marvel, and the fact that the entire project could have easily fallen into the trappings of movie tie-in mundanity.The debut of the Skrulls in the MCU has meant a corresponding resurgence in the pages of Marvel Comics, most consistently reflecting Secret Invasion fallout (over a decade after the event concluded!). Meet the Skrulls taps into this idea of leftover agents of the infiltration living out the American dream, like The Americans with funnier chins. Much like Vision, though, Meet the Skrulls is a book about family before it’s a book about superheroes and villains, and it’s this heart that brings it to higher levels.I’ve been a fan of Chip Zdarsky since reading his pitch-perfect plan for Watchmen 2, but it’s still been amazing to watch his rise from hilarious Sex Criminals co-creator to top 5 Marvel Universe storyteller.Daredevil cements the fact that Zdarsky’s not a joke writer, he’s just a writer. The opening arc connects heavily (and new reader friendly-ery… speaking of writers…) to themes from Netflix’s Daredevil season three, and leans into Matt Murdock’s struggles with faith. It also features one of the best Daredevil and Punisher moments in memory!Amazingly, this is only the beginning. Zdarksy and collaborators like the amazing Marco Checchetto are finding new lanes for the Daredevil mythos, playing in the same ballpark as Miller, Nocenti, and Bendis while finding something new to say. This is a classic in the making and a book Marvel fans should not be sleeping on.Immortal Hulk achieves the rarefied status of a consensus MVP in the Marvel lineup, and somehow feels like new issues are *always* being released. It’s prolific efficiency at its finest, in the way that only the best superhero runs ever nail. Al Ewing and Joe Bennett’s imaginative distillation of the “horror Hulk” is an instant classic in the history of Marvel, the best the Hulk’s been in over a decade, and oh so nearly my favorite Marvel comic book of 2019.It’s important to me to sell two things here: 1) House of X and Powers of X is the most exciting Marvel moment of the year and 2) Immortal Hulk is *still* insanely close to matching the book’s excellence!The House of X experience is arguably my favorite comic of 2019 from any publisher, and also the one that got me Youtubin’ weekly like a common media mogul. Nothing in comics matches the thrill of 12 straight weeks of mind-blowing X-Men comics spread across two titles.

      "The Best 100 DC Comics Since Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985)!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansAugust 22, 2020 by Comic Book Herald Staff 7 Comments In April 1985, DC Comics kicked off the most momentous event in their shared universe’s modern history. Comics superstars Marv Wolfman and George Perez’s Crisis on Infinite Earths delivered cosmic ramifications that rippled across DC’s Multiverse and remain to this day. By the time the twelfth issue concluded the event in March 1986, DC Comics was irrevocably split into a history pre and post-Crisis.For best of DC Comics list-making purposes, this is both essential to acknowledge, and frankly a relief! While Comic Book Herald has guides covering DC’s earlier years starting with Action Comics #1, it’s useful to focus in on the “Post-Crisis” landscape of the modern DC Universe.A few caveats about the list:Otherwise, I think “the best DC Comics of the modern era!” is pretty self-explanatory.

In the hands of Moore and artists like John Totleben and Stephen Bissette, with editor Karen Berger protecting their vision and in the process defanging the Comics Code Authority and paving the way for Vertigo Comics, Swamp Thing became fertile ground for Moore’s imagination. From the groundbreaking, redefining “Anatomy Lesson” to the interspecies love of “Rite of Spring” to the psychedelic space journey of its final issues, Moore’s time on Swamp Thing is remarkable for the amount of depth it gave to its characters and massive variety of themes it explored.It also dared to publish stories that made mainstream readers look at DC Comics in a new light through its heavily philosophical approach and grotesque body horror. It’s no small exaggeration to say that Moore’s Swamp Thing became a foundational text for generations to follow. And it shows just how much could be done with an unloved character when a creator has a passion for comics and a willingness to explore both heady and difficult themes through their work. — Matt DraperCreators: Frank Miller, David MazzuchelliIssues: Batman #404-407Every legend has to start somewhere, even the Batman. However, Batman: Year One acts as not only an insight to Batman’s first year, but for Detective Jim Gordon as well. The now inescapable storyline chronicles the ups and downs of learning to work in Gotham City. For Bruce Wayne, it’s trying to understand how best to go about his mission. Applying theatricality and understanding the tools necessary to strike fear in the hearts of the wicked. While from Gordon’s point of view, his first year revolves around navigating the crooked underbelly of the Gotham Police Department. The pair mirror each other well in a fantastic tale that is certainly worth its legacy. — Mikayla LairdCreators: John Byrne, Dick GiordanoIssues: Man of Steel #1 to #6Man of Steel is perhaps Superman in his purest form. Stripping Superman of some of the more outlandish powers of the Silver Age, and reinventing the character, in a simpler, modern era, Man of Steel sees Clark Kent taken back to his roots, learning his place in his world. We see Clark gaining his costume, particularly as a tribute to both sets of parents, moving to Metropolis and meeting Batman. Man of Steel is arguably the quintessential Superman origin story, and the reinvention of the world around him, especially in the form of Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. For modern day Superman fans, this is your point of origin. — Mikayla LairdCreators: George PerezIssues: Wonder Woman #1 to #62, War of the GodsGeorge Perez’s reboot of Wonder Woman does something all-too-rare in superhero comics: uses the actions of its characters and worldbuilding to express and explore powerful themes, rather than simply wallpapering a stock superhero story with ultimately hollow thematic signifiers. Diana is explicitly made a feminist, and feminine, rebuttal to the “standard” archetype of superheroics (read: masculine), with love and mercy wielded alongside strength and pragmatism. But this complexity of character doesn’t weigh down a book this well-plotted and paced (not to mention gorgeously pencilled by Perez), which re-establishes Diana’s core connection to Greek mythology while deftly moving us through a riveting reboot of her origin.Compare the first seven issue arc, “Gods & Mortals,” with the 2017 film and see how Perez’s ending profoundly honors Diana as a character more than any “climactic” fistfight ever could. — Zack DeaneCreators: Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Lynn VarleyIssues: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1 to #4As the car goes racing across the track, about to speed out of control, Bruce thinks to himself, “This would be a good death.” It’s been many years since The Batman retired, he’s been gone for long enough that the younger generation believe he’s nothing but a myth. Bruce Wayne continues to live his life, but is still upset with the state of the world. One night, he finds himself back in the Batcave and decides to put the costume on again. However, the return of the Batman also brings with it the return of villains, as well as an untrusting world that isn’t too sure whether or not to trust him again, or even if this is the same person Gotham once knew. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John HigginsIssues: Watchmen #1 to #12Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins’ classic masterpiece. Often mischaracterized as deconstructionist, ‘realistic’, or ‘cynical’, Watchmen is so, so much more. It’s a trailblazer for how superhero stories could be told, what was actually possible with them, and how they could be utilized to pose and explore powerful questions. Watchmen is a guidebook on how to use formalism to enhance your story, and to tell stories in fresh new ways, whether it be through prose backmatter, the 9-panel grid, or cutting across genres, and coloring.It’s a book about humanity, and how we are all we have, and how even in the face of absolute Armageddon, we can be kind and decent to one another. We’re all we have, so we have to watch out for one another, eh? That’s Watchmen. So read, and watch, for there are masters at work here. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Tom ZiukoIssues: Superman Annual #11 (1985)While this list is predominantly full of full graphic novels and lengthy runs, I have to acknowledge some of Moore’s smaller work across the DC Universe, and there aren’t many that stick with me more than “For the Man Who Has Everything.” Alongside Watchmen collaborator Dave Gibbons, Moore and team weave a perfect one and done story about Mongul invading the Fortress of Solitude and using the “Black Mercy” to make Superman think he has everything he ever wanted back home on Krypton. The issue was later translated in the 2000’s animated Justice League Unlimited and feels as timeless as ever.  — DaveCreators: JM Dematteis, Keith Giffen, Kevin MaGuireIssues: Justice League #1 to #6, Justice League International #7 to #25, Justice League America #26 to #30, Justice League Europe #1 to #6DeMatteis, Giffen and MaGuire’s post-Crisis Justice League remains a breath of fresh air, a gorgeous influx of cartoon whimsy in the heart of “Comics aren’t just for kids anymore!” fever. It’s also a miracle this book even happened, with an approach to Justice League so tonally inconsistent with historic expectations the series was retitled to Justice League International (and the eventual spinoff Justice League Europe) within six issues. It’s easy to reduce the run to the comedic tenor and “One Punch!” but JLI is also the series that made Booster Gold, Blue Beetle, Fire, Ice, Guy Gardner, Captain Atom and a host of others (including the rejuvenation of Scott Free and Big Barda!) forever matter to DC fans. — DaveCreators: Jim Starlin, Mike Mignola, Carlos Garzon, Steve OliffIssues: Cosmic Odyssey #1 to #4Independently, Jim Starlin and Mike Mignola are some of my favorite comic book creators of all time, with Starlin’s Marvel Cosmic work of the 70’s and early 90’s perfecting the framework that gave the world Thanos, and Mignola’s Hellboy universe standing out as one of the best achievements in comics. Before Hellboy and Infinity Gauntlet, the creators teamed up for 1988’s Cosmic Odyssey, a miniseries/event that finds Darkseid seeking the aid of Earth’s heroes and New Genesis. Whereas Legends worked to re-establish the presence of Kirby’s Darkseid as a post-Crisis DCU big bad, Cosmic Odyssey actually delivers a 4th World crossover worthy of the legacy. — DaveCreators: Denny O’Neil, Denys Cowan, Rick MagyarIssues: The Question #1 to #36This masterpiece of a series resurrects the faceless vigilante and sets him in search of himself. But that’s not its only fantastic metaphor, as the book nakedly captured famous Bat-Editor Denny O’Neil’s own recovery from drugs and alcohol in real-time. This lends it both sympathy and power as both Sage and O’Neil search for “the wisdom to tell the difference” in a world of things they cannot change. O’Neil and The Question rewrite concepts like justice, fairness, drive, and survival, all of which become big influences on Miller’s Batman, Brubaker’s Cap/Winter Soldier, and arguably Moore’s Watchmen. And Cowan’s pencils and Magyar’s inks are superb; part film, part fashion shoot (the panels! the poses!), influencing everyone from Miller to Liefeld to Mack. — John GalatiCreators: John Ostrander, Luke McDonnell, Kim YaleIssues: Suicide Squad #1 to #66Trying to imagine the DC Universe without the Suicide Squad is nearly impossible, but pre-Crisis Task Force X was a forgotten concept, until John Ostrander, Luke McDonnell and Kim Yale launched this modern version that resonates today. Suicide Squad is easily one of the best superhero concepts to arise from this era of DC Comics, putting assorted imprisoned DC supervillains to use as a Black Ops arm of the US government (Yep, it’s The Dirty Dozen for capes). In Squad, Amanda Waller, Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), Boomerang and many more became unforgettable central pillars of the DC Universe at large. As a whole, the series is remarkably effective at exploring the psychology of the squad, while simultaneously throwing them into political/global turmoil that frequently results in failed missions and “terminated” members. It’s a testament to the work of everyone involved that the killer concept has never been this good since. — DaveCreators: John Ostrander, Kim Yale, Luke McDonnellIssues: Deadshot #1 to #4The Suicide Squad, well, squad (#squadsquad) double down on their efforts to make Floyd Lawton the most complex psyche in the series (at least this side of Amanda Waller), in a solo story with some truly surprising twists. In theory, you could easily lump this in with the larger Suicide Squad run and the late 80’s exploration of the underbelly of crime in the DC Universe. These four issues stand out on their own, though, both as essential facets to making Deadshot an interesting villain/anti-hero, and frankly as a testament to just how bleak late 80’s DC could get. — DaveCreators: Mike GrellIssues: Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters #1 to #3While the transformation begins with Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams Green Lantern/Green Arrow in the early 70’s, the post-Crisis maturation of Oliver Queen is all Mike Grell, starting with the 3 issue Longbow Hunters miniseries and on into the long running ongoing series that began in 1988. It’s an oversimplification, but Grell’s Green Arrow is closer to Marvel’s Punisher with a bow and arrow than the legacy of trick arrows and that Robin Hood get-up would ever have you believe. Much like The Killing Joke, critical re-examination of the work rightly addresses the handling of sexual violence and gender dynamics, so it’s also worth acknowledging the deep flaws at the root of the reinvention as you explore. — DaveCreators: Alan Moore, Brian BollandIssues: OGNOne bad day can change the course of your life. This is the philosophy of The Joker, once again anointed here as Batman’s greatest enemy. It’s a philosophy that both Batman and The Joker can connect to, as The Killing Joke explores brilliantly. After escaping Arkham Asylum, the Joker plans to put his theory into action, shooting Barbara Gordon through the spine, and kidnapping Commissioner Gordon. Interspliced with perhaps Joker’s most well-known origin story, Gordon is brutally tortured by the Joker’s henchmen, while Batman races against time to save him. The stunning art and strong writing make for a tale that stays with the reader long after the final page. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Tim TrumanIssues: Hawkworld #1 to #3There’s old comics you read, which feel dated. They’re a struggle, they’re a chore. Then you read old comics that feel like they could be published tomorrow. They’re works that last and work so well, even decades later. Tim Truman’s seminal Hawkworld mini-series is that brand of storytelling. It’s the rare Post-TDKR and Watchmen text that actually understands the lessons of those works. It’s the reboot of Hawkman that feels like a prestige HBO series, and it’s a big, political story about a man of privilege, a conservative cop, who realizes how broken the system he’s a part of is, and must cope with the horror of that.Fiercely contemporary, absolutely unyielding, and devastatingly honest in its observations, it’s a work that skewers the imperialism of Thanagar, which serves as a mirror for examinations of US imperialism. The Hawkworld? It isn’t in space, it’s down here on earth, everywhere around us. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Keith Giffen, Mary Bierbaum, Tom Bierbaum, Al GordonIssues: Adventures of Superman #478, Legion of Super-Heroes (1989) #1-39, Who’s Who #1-11, #13, #14, #16, Timber Wolf #1-5, and Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #1-3At this point, there are few things in Big 2 comics that quite get my attention like massive fan-favorite runs that somehow fall outside the collective consensus canon. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about comics, but I live for those moments when somebody says “Have you read 5YL?” and I have no idea what they’re talking about!This was absolutely the case with the Keith Giffen written and plotted 1989 Legion of Super-Heroes relaunch, the divisive “Five Years Later” timeline. Conceptually, 5YL is brilliant, throwing readers into the deep end of Legion lore, five years (sing it with me David Bowie style, “FIVE YEARS!!!”) after the end of the “Magic Wars,” and with the perpetually teenage Legion suddenly grown up and often struggling. It’s not the Legion your pops grew up with in the Silver Age, and it’s not even the celebrated Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen Legion from a few years prior. Ultimately, that’s the point.– DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Dave McKeanIssues: OGNEven with Morrison’s full script and numerous rereads, Arkham Asylum is borderline incomprehensible. Jungian psychology overlaid on geometric symbolism underlined with the jumbled and dark art of Dave McKean makes “A Serious House on Serious Earth” a challenging read for anyone. Combine that with a Batman who feels completely weak and ineffectual and it becomes obvious from the start that Morrison is more interested in Batman’s mental state than his actions. Arkham Asylum came out in the wake of the trail-blazing “The Dark Knight Returns” and “The Killing Joke,” which paved the wave for new takes on Batman. But Morrison’s work is the rejection of those stories and their imitators’ focus on realism in favor of maddening symbolism. And its success rocketed Morrison to superstardom.It’s a disturbing piece of symbolic existential horror that terrifies the reader by letting our imaginations run wild as we probe the terrors lurking within the subconscious mind. Morrison would go on to write more literal, action-oriented Batman stories that probe the The Dark Knight’s ego, but Arkham Asylum feels like Morrison grabbing a live wire and channeling that energy right into the reader. You can’t help but feel both empowered and repulsed by it. — Matt DraperCreators: JM Dematteis, Shawn McManus, Mark McKennaIssues: Doctor Fate #1 to #24The Dematteis, MacManus, McKenna era of the new Doctor Fate is easily among the most underrated selections on this entire list, and for my money the most underrated. None of these comics are even collected by DC! It’s far from a perfect run, but following DeMatteis and Keith Giffen’s Doctor Fate miniseries resolving the fate of Kent Nelson (well, sorta), Fate becomes a supernatural hero inhabited by two distinct personalities, one male and childlike, and one female. The series quickly explores the Lords of Chaos and Order, interjecting I, Vampire into the proceedings, and maintaining a madcap sense of humor throughout it all. — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Richard CaseIssues: Doom Patrol #19 to #63The World’s Strangest Heroes. They’re a lively bunch, and a wonderful concept, but after their initial Silver Age run ended, The Doom Patrol spent an absurd amount of time not being what their motto promised. They were fairly standard superheroes, in a book that reflected that.Enter: Grant Morrison, Richard Case, and John Workman. The now legendary creative team reshaped that entire world, pushing the central concept to its absolute limits, and taking it to realms it had never been. A spiritual successor to Gerber’s Defenders, in a Claremont X-world, Morrison’s vision was a hurricane of neverending big ideas, influenced by everything from Dadaism to experimental European filmmaking. By the time it was over, one thing was clear: This was the defining run, now and forever. As the concept’s creator Arnold Drake put it, this is the one run that understood the concept and fulfilled its intentions best, even better than its own creator. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Grant Morrison, Chas Truog, Tom GrummettIssues: Animal Man #1 to #26Grant Morrison has made an entire career out of doing the impossible. In this case, starting with a 60s c-list superhero who borrows “powers” from animals (?!). A character that Carmine Infantino probably banged out before lunch. Morrison dusts him off, gives him a modern family and a very modern cause. And he makes them live on the lid of a jack-in-the-box. The story is covered by a goofy Saturday morning cartoon. But inside of that is a warhead of philosophy and emotion, just waiting for its musical queue. That’s impressive all by itself. But the fact the book respects its audience enough to ask them to not only think but search inside themselves? Like I said, impossible. — John GalatiCreators: Ron Marz, Darryl BanksIssues: Green Lantern (Vol 3) #48 to #55When Superman “died,” Hal Jordan took on his cosmic foes. But when Superman returned, the threat to Jordan remained. This is the story of how Jordan failed to save his home, Coast City, and how Superman and the universe failed Jordan again and again.  Marz, Willingham, Haynes, and co, do an astounding job of capturing the grief and terror of a Green Lantern in mourning. But they also capture something else: the ending, where only a single Guardian is left alive with a single ring. The ring sets out to find the last champion left in the universe: a bust-out artist who would become the most powerful Lantern of all. That arc from tragedy to comedy is difficult but rewarding, some middle part from the Zero Hour editorial debacle! — John GalatiCreators: Mark Waid, Greg LarocqueIssues: The Flash #62 to #128There’s normal runs, and then there’s Chase-The-Dragon runs. Runs so definitive and defining, they overshadow, subsume and become almost the entirety of a franchise, with almost everything after being in response, or in pursuit of it. There is almost no way to separate the work from the fabric of the fiction, it’s seeped in deep and far too ingrained now. That’s Mark Waid’s Flash. From Speed Forces, Flash Families, Reverse Flashes to legendary legacies, this run is what made the character for not just a generation, but every generation after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waid took John Broome and Carmine Infantino’s vibrant creation, who’d rusted to become a dull conservative, and put new life, and genuine heart into him. A whole slew of disparate characters found thematic unity under his pen, with legacy and family being essential. Waid did the impossible in Big Two comics: He made the successor surpass the mentor. Wally West with The Flash Family, was The Flash. — Ritesh BabuCreators: James Robinson, Paul SmithIssues: The Golden Age #1 to #4In truth, I’ve never understood JSA-heads. Unless you’re literally my dad (in which case, thanks for everything pops!) the thrills of the Golden Age generation are a wonderful concept and legacy in the DC Universe that I only occasionally want to focus on directly. Perhaps that’s why the Watchmen’s Minutemen meets Wild Cards Book One approach of Robinson and Smith’s JSA: The Golden Age resonates most. In this alternate post World War II America, the Justice Society of America has largely hung up the tights just in time for McCarthyism and the House of Unamerican Activities Committee. For his part, Robinson would go on to greater heights exploring legacy in the DC Universe in the pages of Starman, but “The Golden Age” is a notable progression getting there. — DaveCreators: Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, Alan GrantIssues: Batman: Vengeance of Bane Special #1, Batman #491-500, Detective Comics #659-666, Showcase ’93 #7-8 and Batman: Shadow of the Bat #16-18The all-star talent behind this had insanely ambitious goals. “The Jailbreak at Arkham” act is a perfect (re)introduction to the title, yet the full arc concludes six years of a “breaking the Bat” narrative that stretches from Death in the Family to Death of Superman. (In fact, Knightfall improves/fixes the year-old DoS story concept itself.) But most shocking of all: it’s a major bat-event with very little Joker. Instead, Knightfall takes Bane—then the newest bat-villain—to the top slot, making him Kraven to Batman’s Spider-Man; a multi-threat, multi-avenue predator who can shake their foe to the absolute core. You can hear echoes of Knightfall in everything from Hush to Winter Soldier. Now if we could just undo Schumacher’s Trenchcoat Bane… — John GalatiCreators: Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson, Roger Stern, John Bogdanove, Tom Grummett, Jackson Guice, moreIssues: Superman: The Man of Steel #18-19, Justice League America #69, Superman #74-75, Adventures of Superman #497, and Action Comics #684The event that shocked the world, can the Man of Steel ever truly be killed in battle? The year long event saw not only the death of Superman at the hands of Doomsday, but the mystery of the 4 new Supermen. Each claiming to be the successor to the Superman title. Each of the four Supermen, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman and the Eradicator, highlight an aspect of Superman, but as the story goes on, it’s clear that there is no true replacement for Superman. The question now becomes, how do you resurrect the man who shouldn’t have died in the first place? — Mikayla LairdCreators: Jeph Loeb, Tim SaleIssues: The Long Halloween #0 to #13, Dark Victory #0 to #13The creative team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale have basically crafted a masterpiece every time they’ve worked together, but they may be most directly tied to their two titanic Batman miniseries. “The Long Halloween” serves as a replacement Year Two for The Dark Knight, tying up loose ends from Frank Miller’s “Year One” while transitioning Gotham from a gangster’s paradise to a freakish playground. “Dark Victory” wraps up the lingering ideas of “Halloween” while reversing that first story’s bleak musings on Batman by providing a new origin for Dick Grayson’s Robin. Each works as a compelling, cartoonishly gothic mystery that mentally and emotionally challenges Batman while also working as a far-better blockbuster comic than Loeb’s later, also villain-stuffed, “Hush.”Best of all, both of these stories serve as compelling narratives for Harvey Dent, both before and after his transformation into Two-Face. When done right, Dent is a tragic figure that reflects Bruce Wayne’s darkest impulses. By affording Dent with nearly as much narrative real estate as his title hero, the duality of Two-Face makes both “Long Halloween” and “Dark Victory” into stories that can be read for their sheer thrills as well as their ruminations on human psychology. — Matt DraperCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: Flex Mentallo: Man of Muscle Mystery #1 to #4The character of Flex Mentallo, Hero of the Beach, is one of many reasons Morrison’s time writing Doom Patrol is among my top 10 favorite comics of all time. There’s something so impossibly comical and powerful about muscle mystery, the ode to Silver Age comic book advertisements, and the ability to flex the Pentagon into a circle. Morrison returned to Flex in 1996 with artist Frank Quitely (in what would become one of comics most celebrated collaborations), and a challenging, meta-fictional and deeply fascinating four issue miniseries. Flex breaks the mold of superhero comics tropes even moreso than Doom Patrol, while simultaneously laying down the philosophy of a unified superhero landscape, with Morrison really leaning into the one million ideas a minute approach to comics that has defined so much of his work since.Quitely is absolutely a breath of fresh air in the ’96 artistic canon, and all in all Flex Mentallo is a fascinating book for readers well-versed in Morrison-ology. Perhaps the work says it best: “I just wanted to talk about the comics, see? All those sh***y, amazing comics…” — DaveCreators: Garth Ennis, Jamie Delano, Sean Phillips, Steve Hugh, Dave McKeanIssues: Hellblazer #34 to #46John Constantine is a great conman and an almost respectable magician. But his real superpower is his ability to go it completely alone. Seeing him grinding out every day, knowing that he’s learned to not even need Superman’s help, that makes audiences believe he can take on both Heaven and Hell. And Garth Ennis turned that strength into a mortal weakness. Seeing Constantine, wearing a teal hospital gown, yellow sodium light, with no one beside him as he looks at an x-ray seems to cut the strings off him. Then again, it also makes him his most dangerous. — John GalatiCreators: James Robinson, Tony Harris, Peter Snejbjerg, Wade Von GrawbadgerIssues: Starman #1 to #81DC Comics of the 1990’s are uniquely positioned to create, establish and respond to the idea of legacy in an eternal shared story. Throughout the decade we see Kyle Rayner come into his own as Green Lantern, Wally West really become The Flash, Tim Drake become Robin, and as we can all agree, Cyborg Superman and Jean-Paul Valley cementing their claims as World’s Finest (ok, not all legacies are built equally).My favorite saga of legacy, though, comes from a lesser known franchise, with Starman and The Knight family taking center stage in James Robinson and Tony Harris’ long-running series. The path of Starman taps into so much of what makes the DC Universe a thrilling space, fleshing out the mythical Opal City, seamlessly connecting the tapestry of DC’s history from Justice Society to present day, and making everyone from The Shade to Mist some of the coolest supporting characters in the world. This is Robinson at his absolute best, and Tony Harris’ work is simply some of the finest in contemporary superhero comics.  — DaveCreators: Garth Ennis, John McCreaIssues: Hitman #1 to #60Tommy Monaghan is to the Punisher as John Constantine is to Doctor Strange. He’s a smart-mouthed working man, always hard on his luck, trying to figure out how to operate a work/life balance and failing. It’s a fantastic test bed for Ennis’s violent humor. For many, the series apexes with issue 34, Of Thee I Sing (often called “the best Superman story ever.”) And while Ennis does a masterful job of revealing the Man of Steel to be just as unsure and vulnerable as the rest of us, the issue works because of how strong a character Monaghan becomes. The crux of the issue is that when Monaghan tells Superman he’s wrong, we all believe Tommy. — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Howard PorterIssues: JLA #1 to #41As much as I love Justice League International, and all its many quirks, JLA by Morrison and Porter is the book that demands DC’s Justice League reflects the absolute core of the universe, with a central lineup revolving around Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and Martian Manhunter. The quirks will certainly come (the comedic relief of Plastic Man, the surprise inclusion of Huntress), but this is a foundation built to matter. It’s an all time great run, zipping between Martian invasions, Apokoliptan futures, World War III, and everything in between. If you haven’t read a Justice League comic that really worked for you before, it might just mean you haven’t read JLA. — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Drew Geraci, variousIssues: Event/CrossoversThe Justice League are certainly a staple in the DC universe, but it’s hard to believe that any of its members would expect the League to still exist in the 853rd century. As they are visited by their future counterparts, the Justice League are invited to the future in order to attend a ceremony marking the return of Superman. However, not all is as it seems, as the Justice League are separated across the solar system, as a conspiracy theory begins to unfold. Beyond its primary story, DC One Million also finds itself with a multitude of tie-in stories, fleshing out the future of the DC Universe.  — Mikayla LairdCreators: Mark Waid, Alex RossIssues: OGNDon’t let the wanton destruction and copious deaths fool you, Mark Waid and Alex Ross’ “Kingdom Come” is actually a bold strike against the grim and gritty ‘90s. In this dystopian future, the classic heroes of DC Comics have grown old and out of fashion, replaced with lethal vigilantes. But when a retired Superman returns, the clash between young and old may destroy the world. Ross’s hyper realistic paintings are on full display here with bold hero shots and scenes of titanic battles, but it’s Waid’s juxtaposition of the Book of Revelation and meta commentary on the comic book industry of the ‘90s that adds greater weight to a story of idealistic heroes changing and being tempted to fall. Seeing figures like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman come as close as possible to failing the morals that have shaped them for generations and then reembracing the hope that defines them ultimately makes Kingdom Come an inspirational story because of its edge of cynicism.More than 20 years later, it still feels like DC Comics is living in the future shadow of Kingdom Come, guiding its way and standing as a bold critique against the publisher’s tendency to make its heroes and readers suffer. — Matt DraperCreators: Paul Dini, Bruce TimmIssues: Batman Adventures Annual #1-2, Batman Adventures Holiday Special, Adventures In The Dc Universe #3 And Batman Black And White #1The origin from one of Batman the Animated Series most celebrated episodes, Mad Love shows a dark and disturbing side to the relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Harley is desperate to help the Joker and see him smile, but every time she tries to help, he ends up pushing her away, usually out of a window. The relationship between Harley and Joker is front and centre as the story also acts as an origin story for Harley, reliving the events that put her in this situation. Mad Love is definitive in how it set the tone for Harley and Joker stories moving forward, especially when it comes to Harley’s reimagining within DC Comics. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Jeph Loeb, Tim SaleIssues: Superman For All Seasons #1-4One of the most important elements to a Superman origin story is how the world reacts to him. In For All Seasons, we see four phases of Superman’s early development, mirroring the four seasons of a year. Each season is narrated by someone close to Clark and provides unique perspectives on his life. The story primarily spans from the time Clark leaves Smallville, to establishing himself in Metropolis as a protector. The way the story reflects the changing seasons makes it unique when it comes to early Superman tales. The brilliant team of Loeb and Sale tell a truly beautiful tale, with some amazing stand out moments that really grounds Clark Kent. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Walt SimonsonIssues: Orion #1 to #25The influence of Jack Kirby’s 4th World is emminently clear in post-Crisis DC right out of the gates, with Darkseid taking central roles in the likes of Legends or Cosmic Odyssey (not to mention the previously referenced JLA “Rock of Ages”). Still, there’s not a ton of actual New Gods comics worthy of a best-of conversation (Although let me be among the first to nominate John Byrne’s Genesis for a worst-of conversation) until you get to Kirby acolyte and all-time great Walt Simonson’s run on Orion. While it’s not quite as good or all-encompassing as Simonson’s Thor for Marvel, Orion is a gorgeous work that digs deep into both the life of Darkseid’s son raised on New Genesis, and the mythology of the 4th World. Frankly, a very good “in” to the New Gods for readers newer to DC.– DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: OGNWhat happens when you must revamp classic Gardner Fox Justice League concepts in a Post-Crisis world without a multiverse? Well, this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely’s revival of The Crime Syndicate and Earth-3 is one that splices together Gardner Fox notions with John Broome brilliance, to recreate the realm of Earth-3 in The Anti-Matter Universe. Quitely’s very much in his Post-Flex and Pre-All-Star phase, lending the book an odd visual quality, as it explodes with prime 2000s widescreen cinematic flair. It’s a bit weird, a bit creepy, and all in all, becomes the modern bedrock for interpreting both Earth-3 and Anti-Matter, influencing everything that’d come after, whether it be Dwayne McDuffie movies or New 52 reboots.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is very much the Star Trek Mirror Universe episode of the Morrison Justice League saga. The dark doppelgangers emerge from the Reversoverse, and the stage is set for a classical JL epic spanning a whole host of characters and various realities. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Mark Waid, Leinil Francis YuIssues: Superman: Birthright #1-12The origin of Superman, as told by Mark Waid and Leinil Yu. If All-Star Superman is the revered ideal 12-part conclusion and endpoint for the character, Birthright is the ideal 12-part beginning. It spans everything from his time in Smallville to his establishment of Superman, and just what that actually means. It’s the Post-Byrne rehabilitation of the character which displaces shame for what before with an earnest sincerity that works. It goes so far that it reworks the classic Silver Age Superboy-Lex Luthor friendship and hair loss story into a touching, sweet tale of youth, companionship, and separation.Whether it be playing Krypton with a grandeur and majesty rarely seen, or centering more on Lara and Ma Kent than the men as most do, Birthright is an emotionally honest, touching update to The Man Of Tomorrow. All that and maybe the best single splash image to sum up who Superman is, ever. It’s all in there. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Scott Beatty, , Marcos Martin, Javier Pulido, Robert Campanella, Alvaro Lopez, Chuck DixonIssues: Robin: Year One #1 to #4, Batgirl: Year One #1 to #9One of the absolute coolest things about this “Year One” combo platter is the powerhouse artistic might of Javier Pulido on “Robin” and Marcos Martin on “Batgirl.” These are fantastic looking origin flashbacks, in the vein of Miller/Mazzuchelli on Batman: Year One but of course never trying too desperately to emulate those impossible standards. With years of Nightwing under our belt as seasoned DC readers, it’s also fascinating and refreshing to reflect back on Dick Grayson’s earliest days as Batman’s boy wonder, and just what exactly drove him to play the part. Batgirl experty treads similar ground for Barbara Gordon, already in her Oracle role in continuity as the flashbacks were coming out. There’s more of a tragedy at the heart of Batgirl’s “Year One,” knowing what Killing Joke has in wait, but it’s still glorious to watch Marcos Martin and Alvaro Lopez deliver a kick from Babs right into the face of Killer Moth. — DaveCreators: Kyle BakerIssues: Plastic Man #1 to #20Incredibly gifted cartoonist Kyle Baker takes the Golden Age comedy ethos of Plastic Man and transports it into a run unlike anything else DC Comics was producing (or honestly, is producing today!). Plastic Man is Baker’s vision of Eel O’Brien reconciling his past as a criminal, but through the lens of Looney Toons, newspaper strips, and Roger Rabbit. If you’re looking for capital “S” serious comics, keep on skimming, but for pure lighthearted storytelling bliss, check out Plastic Man.  — DaveCreators: Mark Weid, Barry Kitson, Tom PeyerIssues: Flash & Green Lantern #1 to #6Few writers have mined DC’s past to the extent Mark Waid has. Even fewer still have his wild encyclopedic understanding of that world. So fitting then that he tackles the two vital silver age icons handled and established as friends by John Broome in the 60s. A pseudo-successor to his and Kitson’s JLA: Year One, Brave and the Bold goes through the wild, weird history of The Flash and Green Lantern, Barry Allen and Hal Jordan, and mines for the heart amidst all the strange trappings of The Silver Age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accessible to newcomers, but reverent towards the old in a way that is pleasing for older readers, the book is, in essence, Waid’s platonic ideal of superhero comics. Fun, quick, earnest and rooted in their history. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Mark Waid, Howard Porter, variousIssues: JLA #43 to #46The absolute unbeatable machismo of the man dressed like a bit took on new life with Morrison and Porter’s first arc on JLA, where Bruce Wayne stands alone against the White Martian threat and keeps the League together. Writer Mark Waid doubles down on that ethos in “Tower of Babel,” extending the thinking that the man who plans for every contingency would have all manner of weapons and plots at his disposal to keep the Justice League in check just in case. In Bruce’s defense, heroes tend to get mindcontrolled or zombiefied every other story arc, so you can at least see where he’s coming from. Obviously, Batman’s anti-League protocols fall into the wrong hands (in this case, the Al Ghuls) and the relationship between Batman and the League takes a notable turn, playing through DC Comics for the remainder of the 2000’s. — DaveCreators: Andy Diggle, JockIssues: Green Arrow Year One #1 to #8For anyone who hasn’t seen LOST, the success of CW’s “Arrow” (and the verse it spawned) can all be traced back to Green Arrow: Year One.  Andy Diggle and the artistic might of Jock combine to solidify Oliver Queen’s modern island origins. For me, this was an incredible introduction to the work of Jock who has since gone on to incredible heights in collaborations with Scott Snyder (for example, Batman: The Black Mirror, or Wytches). Incredibly, you can hand this ‘Year One’ story to just about anybody interested in the legacy of Oliver Queen, and watch them come away a newfound comic book fan. — DaveCreators: Kevin Smith, Phil HesterIssues: Green Arrow #1 to #10Speaking of the Emerald Archer, heading into the 2000’s, Oliver Queen was dead (literally) and directionless (editorially). Enter filmmaker Kevin Smith and artist Phil Hester, who put Ollie back on the map with an in-continuity revival that helps explain Green Arrow’s place in the DC Universe through the ages, and sets the stage for the role the character can play in the new millennium. Smith’s DC Comics writing definitely peaked with this story, but he gets a lot right introducing the Green Arrow to a new generation of readers.  — DaveCreators: Gail Simone, Ed BenesIssues: Birds of Prey #56 to #108Writer Gail Simone and frequent artistic collaborator Ed Benes didn’t create the Birds of Prey, but ask any fan of the comic about the team and series, and they’ll really without fail refer to the Simone era. This is where Barbara Gordon (Oracle), Dinah Lance (Black Canary), Helena Bertinelli (Huntress), and a rotating cast of interesting heroes, antiheroes and villains all truly come into their own as a unit. I don’t know that I can overstate the importance of making an all woman superhero squad this damn cool, when even attempting such a thing was (and remains!) a rarity in the DC Universe. Whether you’re a fan of the movie, or just looking for good comics, this run on Birds of Prey is a must. — DaveCreators: Greg Rucka, Drew Johnson, James RaizIssues: Wonder Woman #206 to #213Greg Rucka is commonly known and understood to be the definitive modern writer for Diana, and this first run, which is what leads to his eventual second run, is a good showcase for why. His interpretation of Diana as a political figure, icon, and writer, surrounded by Kythotaur (no, not Minotaur) chefs who cook only delicious vegetarian food and Supermen who edit her manuscript, is one that strikes a chord and feels at once classical yet fresh, particularly for its period. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s less of a straight forward superhero comic and more a thriller that’s heavily political, with conservatives who lose their mind at Diana’s progressivism to news show debates. It’s a run that’s messy, but yet also resonant in its messiness. You can’t not love Diana, our Wonder Woman, coming out of this. Rucka understood the very essence, the soul of the character. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Jeph Loeb, Jim LeeIssues: Batman #609 to #619Spend enough years reading too many comics and you’ll find an encroaching realization that plenty of immensely popular works that you loved on your journey to getting into comics aren’t particularly cool among the critically acclaimed and respected crowd. Hush by Loeb and Jim Lee is definitely one of those works. While ultimately it doesn’t matter what other people suggest you should think about a comic (says the guy compiling a list of the 100 best!), I’m certain I couldn’t read Hush now without sucumbing to the criticisms I’ve seen about the recycled “parade of villains” approach Loeb took from “The Long Halloween,” or about the absolute inanity of the titular Hush as a Batman villain anyone should pretend to care about.But when I read Hush in a library with as many comics as I could carry sitting in a stack next to me, voraciously reading one after the other as I rediscovered the joys of superhero stories? Oh yeah, Hush hit the damn spot. This is my favorite Jim Lee work of the 2000’s, as he makes the entire Batman Universe completely his own, and it’s the kind of story you can hand to anyone kinda interested in reading comics and hook them on the medium. That’s tremendously valuable, critics be gosh darned! — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: All-Star Superman #1 to #12There’s a fine line that separates the tender humanity of Superman with the character’s super-sized mythology. And while the scope and scale of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely’s standalone miniseries “All-Star Superman” plays into The Man of Steel’s mythological trappings, with the 12 labors of Hercules informing its structure, it’s the humanity of the character that gives this story its emotional heft.The death of Morrison’s father a year prior served as the inspiration behind the central premise of “What if Superman had cancer?” But rather than falling into a fatalistic, disillusioned take on heroism, “All-Star” is all about one man making the most of every second of every day he has left. Of course, this being Morrison, there are plenty of metafictional moments centered on the nature of Superman as a timeless character and the structure of time, but it’s the moments where Superman speaks to the human strength of the people around him, such as a now-iconic suicide prevention or a trip to a child’s cancer ward, that makes All-Star a comic that understands all sides of its hero. In the end, Superman as a fictional creation is designed to inspire us to be better because, to quote Lex Luthor’s humanist revelation at the end of Morrison’s story, “It’s all just us, in here, together. And we’re all we’ve got.” — Matt DraperCreators: Ed Brubaker, Greg Rucka, Michael LarkIssues: Gotham Central #1 to #40What do Gotham Police do when Batman’s not around?That’s the central premise of “Gotham Central,” a police procedural by Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with art by Michael Lark and a rotating stable of artists. With Brubaker and Rucka alternating on short arcs, Gotham Central is able to shift its focus to quite a few different characters, each with their own investigative cases and character arcs. This is grounded, gritty storytelling in Gotham at its best because the characters, storylines, and genre necessitate it. And when larger than life figures like Batman or any number of his villains suddenly show up, they feel larger than life and justifiably terrifying.While Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen are the breakout stars of the title, with the Montoya-centric arc “Half a Life” earning acclaim and awards, a major part of the appeal of “Gotham Central” is its constant unexpected shifts from story to story. Brubaker and Rucka would both go on to further noir acclaim with “Criminal” and “Stumptown,” but their passion for the genre is what gives “Gotham Central” its spark. Life on the Gotham beat is dark, unsettling, and unpredictable, but seeing its toll on the men and women trying to save the city stays compelling even when there’s no bat in sight. — Matt DraperCreators: Marc Andreyko, Javier Pina, Jesus Saiz, Michael Gaydos, variousIssues: Manhunter #1 to #38While longtime DC fans may know Manhunter as Paul Kirk, perhaps from the fantastic 70’s stories by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson, the 2000’s set up Kate Spencer, district attorney and costumed street vigilante. Sure, it’s very much DC’s “Daredevil,” but Kate is a very welcome addition to the universe, with Marc Andreyko, Jesus Saiz and collaborators crafting a deeply underrated run during the era of Identity Crisis. They certainly have their differences, but I definitely think of Kate Spencer along the same tier as Renee Montoya for additions of women characters in the 2000’s that made the entire universe stronger, yet still find themselves not fully integrated in the year 2020. This run is a roadmap for how to make it happen. — DaveCreators: Darwyn Cooke, Ed Brubaker, Paul Gulacy, Jimmy PalmiottiIssues: Catwoman #1 to #37Darwyn Cooke and Ed Brubaker are absolute legends in the world of comics at this point (this list will certainly solidify that as we progress!), and their early 2000’s work on Selina Kyle and Catwoman is some of the best I’ve ever seen with the character. For my money, it’s actually the Catwoman story that very little has been able to capture since. Catwoman fits beautifully into the noir-crime world Cooke and Brubaker are so adept at bringing to life, making this a must-read for fans of either creator. — DaveCreators: Brad Meltzer, Rags MoralesIssues: Identity Crisis #1 to #7Let’s make one thing clear: Identity Crisis is one of the clearest examples of “fridging,” a storytelling cliche in which injury or death falls upon the hero’s loved one, spurring the heroes to action. It commits the age-old sin of framing the punishment of a woman around the anguish of the men who love her, rather than focusing on the women’s experience itself. Identity Crisis also exemplifies the worst impulses of comic writers: equating the inclusion of topics like murder and sexual assault with mature storytelling. However, for my money, this comic is one of the strongest stand-alone entry points into early 2000s DC Comics. Love it or hate it, this dark, brutal tone is here to stay for a time, and Identity Crisis ushers the reader through a compelling mystery that touches on most corners of the DC Universe with relentless energy and confidence. If you want to sum up the state of mid-2000s DC in one tight package, Identity Crisis is your comic.— Zack DeaneCreators: Judd Winick, Doug MahnkeIssues: Batman #635-641, #645-50 and Batman Annual #25First off, if you don’t know anything about Red Hood in the DC Universe, skip this blurb and read, baby, read. Red Hood has become an undeniable fixture since this story, so I tend to assume most DC fans with a casual knowledge of the universe who hides behind the hood. That said, Batman’s second Robin, Jason Todd, was killed (after a preposterous, wait-that-really-happened? fan vote) in 1988. 15+ years later creators Judd Winick and Dough Mahnke returned to Todd in “Under the Red Hood,” exploring what would happen if he came back, and had a serious axe to grind with Batman for letting his murderer, the Joker, run loose all these years. It’s far from the best Batman story ever told, but it explores a pretty common question in the world of Gotham (why does Batman let Joker live?) and is capital I important.  — DaveCreators: Judd Winick, Joshua MiddletonIssues: Superman/Shazam #1-4The Man of Steel meets Earth’s Mightiest Mortal! Quite literally, as this acts as a first meeting between both Superman and Captain Marvel (Shazam) as well as Clark Kent and Billy Batson. It’s clear that this takes place very early in Billy Batson’s outings as Captain Marvel, he’s very unsure of himself as a person, but strives to be like his heroes, rushing into battle as though he’s been through this a million times. First Thunder sees Billy teaming up with Superman for the first time and really learning from him, while trying his hardest not to reveal his true identity, and importantly his age. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Gail Simone, Dale Eaglesham, Brad WalkerIssues: Secret Six #1 to #36Don’t tell anyone, but I actually like Secret Six more than Suicide Squad. Spinning out of the “Villains United” Infinite Crisis tie-in, Secret Six follows the likes of Catman, Deadshot, Bane, Ragdoll, Knockout and Scandal Savage as various jobs take them across the vastness of the DC Universe. Simone, Eaglesham and collaborators craft a sleek, smart, funny story of espionage and antihero-y tendencies that centers perfectly throughout 2000’s era DC Comics. Sometimes the villains of DC are more fun in theory than in story, but in Secret Six they’re all the absolute most fun they can be on the page. This book will make you like Catman and get genuinely offended by the assumptions that he’s a joke!  — DaveCreators: Christopher MoellerIssues: OGNChristopher Muller writes and illustrates a gorgeous graphic novel in which Wonder Woman learns the Justice League is going to die to death at the hands of a Dragon, and then decides she has to defeat the entire league by herself to ultimately save their lives. And before fighting the Dragon by herself with her bare ass hands. It’s absolutely the kind of gloriously dumb concepts that can work in the right creator’s hands, and Moeller pulls it off. Plus, we get to see Batman take down the whole League every other Wednesday, which makes it all the more essential to see Diana operate on that same level, with that same strategy, and with even more power. — DaveCreators: Kurt Busiek, Stuart ImmonenIssues: Superman Secret Identity #1 to #4Part of DC’s Elseworlds imprint, what if you were named after the world’s most famous comic book Superhero? What if you also had to live in middle America, being constantly compared to said Superhero? Clark Kent puts up with this every day, though the constant mocking from his classmates don’t exactly make life any easier. However, when camping alone one night, Clark finds himself flying up in the air. His strength has increased, and he finds himself with abilities straight out of the comic books. While this could very well be a blessing, it brings with it paranoia, confusion, and worry. Superman: Secret Identity follows the young Clark Kent as he tries to live his life and understand the reasons behind his strange abilities. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Darwyn CookeIssues: The New Frontier #1-6Darwyn Cooke’s 2004 limited series is designed to place the old school heroism of DC heroes within the historical context that gave birth to them in the first place through a story that wonders what the world would be like if heroes such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern actually came into the world in the year of their comic book debut. By being primarily set in the ‘50s, Cooke’s art is perfectly complemented by period-accurate mid-century design and fashion while his story of the Silver Age of heroes reckons with the hope of John F. Kennedy’s “New Frontier” speech and the horror of racial injustice.“The New Frontier” encompasses a wide cast of characters, with each hero or team either being met with daring victories or tragic deaths as the United States tries to reckon with the Cold War abroad and injustices at home. What’s incredible about Cooke’s masterpiece is that it works just as well as an encapsulation of everything that makes DC Comics special as it does as one man’s attempt to grapple with everything that makes a nation both great and tragically flawed. Plus, there’s a giant floating alien dinosaur alien that gets blown up by The Flash running real fast. — Matt DraperCreators: Mark Millar, Dave Johnson, Killian PlunkettIssues: Superman: Red Son #1 to #3My literal favorite part about “Red Son” is Batman hopping around in his cute Russian winter hat, but admittedly the “What if Superman landed in Cold War Russia?” concept is a pretty strong hook too. “Red Son” definitely feels like Millar at his most restrained, channeling the energies of “Whatever Happened to The Man of Tomorrow?” rather than his darker trips into cynical depravity. It’s been long enough since I read it that I don’t know that this messaging holds up, but the general idea of Superman’s “American-ness” and the flukyness of that when you consider he crashed in a rocket on our planet is a really great entrypoint into understanding global humanity. The high concept is gorgeous if you let it be.  — DaveCreators: Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Dave Gibbons, Phil Jimenez, George Perez, variousIssues: Full Event/CrossoversI don’t necessarily love Infinite Crisis as a standalone seven issue event book, but when taken in tandem with the excellent over-sized “Countdown” and the various “Countdown” tie-ins that set the stage for things like Secret Six, Checkmate, and a whole bunch of 52, the holistic event is actually quite memorable. So when I say Infinite Crisis belongs on a list like this, I’m talking Omnibus sized, back breaking, can’t read this damn thing anywhere whole Infinite Crisis. Plus, you’ll never punch the mirrors of reality the same way again after reading this beast.– DaveCreators: Greg Rucka, Jesus SaizIssues: Checkmate #1 to #12After Infinite Crisis, the world turned against heroes, which perfectly set the stage for the super-secret spy agency Checkmate to return and pick up where teams like JLA fell. That political tension makes the book a taut thriller, almost like JLA’s own version of Gotham Central, except half “war on terror,” half “cold war.” By keeping fights to just the meaningful ones and cutting out other distractions, the book became more about characters outmaneuvering one another. The stakes aren’t just high, they’re argued until we understand all sides. And with that knowledge, the danger seems far more real than another monster or time-quake. Also, respect for basically reintroducing Alan Scott and Mr. Terrific. — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Keith Giffen, VariousIssues: 52 #1 to #52A weekly comic book bouncing around all corners of the DC Universe, from the minds of four celebrated writers at the peak of their powers, with Keith Giffen’s artistic vision centering everything…. there’s no way that would work, right? Against all odds, 52 tells a wide variety of compelling stories, from the Mad Scientist Island to Renee Montoya and Vic Sage’s journey to Booster Gold trying to figure out broken timelines. 52 is a remarkable follow up to Infinite Crisis, the rare moment in superhero comics where the fallout of an event actually gets dealt with in all kinds of meaningful ways instead of just moving on to the “next crisis.” Likewise, it’s thrilling to find a book at the center of DC that so expressly and purposefully pulls the familiar Justice League faces from the story’s center. The rest of the world gets to shine, and serves as a reminder why we fell for this universe in the first place. — DaveCreators: Geoff Johns, Black Lives Matter, Ivan Reis, Carlos Pacheco, VariousIssues: Green Lantern Rebirth #1-6, Green Lantern Corps Recharge #1-5, Green Lantern #1-25, Green Lantern Corps #14-18, Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1, Green Lantern Secret Files 2005 #1, Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman Prime #1 and Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files #12020 me realizes it sure as hell isn’t “cool” for Hal Jordan to be your favorite Green Lantern, but getting into DC Comics for the first time and watching Hal conquer fear with nothing but a Han Solo attitude and willpower sure left a mark. I have an increasingly difficult time enjoying the work of Geoff Johns, but perhaps so much of it is I’m chasing the highs of Green Lantern and just know I won’t reasonably ever get back there. From the course correction of 90’s era Hal into a modern rejuvenation of the corps to the build-up of the Sinestro Corps War and the Yellow Lantern leader finally feeling like a DC supervillain worthy of a spot on the Legion of Doom, this era of Green Lantern became the center of the DC Universe until the New 52.  — DaveCreators: Keith Giffen, Cully HammerIssues: Blue Beetle #1 to #122000’s era DC Comics definitely becomes more resistant to legacy characters, which is unfortunate because it’s consistently one of the shared universe’s biggest advantages.

      "The proto-Multiversity, and the prelude to Final Crisis, Seven Soldiers is Morrison’s triumphant DC return, with him at his most experimental and bold, let loose from tradition to pursue and revamp a diverse array of ideas and characters in radically distinct comics.

Circling the space between Birds of Prey and Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey, “Sirens” is a team-up book between Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn. It’s a perfect and needed tonal interjection into the dour heart of Gotham, sexy, funny and unpredictable. I don’t know that it starts here, but the rise of Harley Quinn as a cultural force certainly has strong roots in this work, expanded upon in everything from the Birds of Prey movie to the absolutely excellent Harley Quinn animated series.  — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Andy Kubert, JH Williams III, Frank Quitely, JG Jones, VariousIssues: See the reading order!What happens when you give the keys to the Batman kingdom to famed Scottish writer, Grant Morrison? A man who tends to focus heavily on the metaphysical and the idea of the metanarrative. You get DCs Silver Age reborn in the 2000s. The Morrison era of Batman begins with the introduction of Damian Wayne, Batman’s estranged son, before jumping headfirst down a rabbit whole involving The Batman of Zurr-En-Arh, and a journey through time, post Final Crisis. Morrison’s run on Batman truly challenges what it means to be Batman or a member of the Batman Family. Roles change hands when needed, as characters define what it means to live up to expectations, and take on the responsibility of the Bat to the world. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Bryan Miller, Lee GarbettIssues: Batgirl #1 to #24Ask comic book fans to name members of the Bat family and you’ll get a wide variety of answers, but it’s certainly going to be a shock when the few, the proud, the Miller/Garbett Batgirl fans drop Stephanie Brown into the conversation.  — DaveCreators: Scott Snyder, Jock, Francesco FrancavillaIssues: Detective Comics #871-881Lovecraft’s Arkham was home to the disfigured, the cruel, the obscenely rich, and other forms of the criminally insane. It’s inspiration is clear on Gotham, which could easily be described as an open-air asylum. Or a psychologist’s maze. Black Mirror uses a city without Bruce Wayne to give fresh evidence of this. Dick Grayson takes on the mantle, leaving Jim Gordon to be the old soldier creating a split story. We feel Grayson’s vertigo from seeing how Gotham reveals its true nature only to Batman. And we dread beside Gordon as he waits, never knowing when the next tragedy will drop but certain that, whatever comes, it will target his cursed family. And when the streets run red, both men must learn a single lesson: the worst fear is not the unknown, but the intimately familiar revealed as a lie.  — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Yannick Paquette, Chris BurnhamIssues: Batman Incorporated #1-8 & Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes! #1“Batman, Inc.” serves as the third act of Grant Morrison’s time on Batman that spanned from 2006 through 2013 and by taking place after the author had established his larger-than-life Bat-God take on the character, it has the opportunity to be larger and more outlandish than ever. Here, after returning from a purgatorial trip through time and space (just go with it), Bruce Wayne decides that the only way to change the world is to go international and team up with the many heroes inspired by him over the years. While volume 1 acts as a series of mini-arcs that push Batman into new territories, volume 2 serves as the tragic culmination of everything that came before.Morrison is an expert when it comes to playing with a character that will ultimately have to go on after he’s done on the title. And here, the author, teamed with the meaty, bone-breaking art of Chris Burnham, uses the inherent necessity of putting Batman back in the toybox for the next writer as a source of tragedy. Batman is eternal, the ouroboros forever eating its own tail in pursuit of justice that can never be fully attained because this character needs to keep fighting to sell comic books. That can be a source of inspiration for readers, but what does it mean for a son who is suddenly far more mortal than his godlike father? These questions make “Batman, Inc.” into an exploration of both the unlimited potential and tragic limitations of The Dark Knight. — Matt DraperCreators: Greg Rucka, JH Williams IIIIssues: Detective Comics #854-860Yes, the Grant Morrison written era of Batman (and related titles) was thrilling for a wide, wide variety of reasons, but one of the biggest hooks was how it opened doors across the whole line, such as creating a space for Kate Kane, the new Batwoman, to take over Detective Comics in the hands of Greg Rucka and JH Williams III. Rucka is obviously a formidable talent in comics, one of the most consistent creators in the medium, but JH Williams III’s stunning layout after layout is what makes “Elegy” stand tall with the all time greats. Factor in Kate Kane’s queer sexual orientation, an absolute rarity in the DC Universe, and this salvo in Batwoman is absolutely essential to the history of comics. — DaveCreators: Jeff Lemire, Travel Foreman, Steve PughIssues: Animal Man #1 to #29Creators: Scott Snyder, Yanick PaquetteIssues: Swamp Thing #1 to #18Over at Marvel, they have established a unique aesthetic that’s come to be known as Cosmic Marvel, collecting a group of characters and concepts under something of a unified banner. I propose DC has done something similarly unique with the work of Scott Snyder and Jeff Lemire on Swamp Thing and Animal Man, respectively. Building on the work of the Alan Moore written run of Swamp Thing, they have made concrete the building blocks of life with The Green and The Red: real, physical spaces governing the push and pull of natural forces (along with The Rot, always a danger but a necessary evil). These two series weave together the rich histories of the characters of Alec Holland and Buddy Baker into something vibrant and fresh, a mythology that is singular to DC. And while Snyder and Lemire are masterful storytellers, these worlds would not linger in the mind without the horrifying, gruesome art by Travel Foreman and Yanick Pasquette (for Swamp Thing and Animal Man, respectively). I can’t imagine using the description “beautiful body horror” before seeing Foreman’s creations, but his visceral (and I mean that literally) vision of The Rot has to be seen to be believed. — Zack DeaneCreators: Brian Azzarello, Cliff ChiangIssues: Wonder Woman #1 to #36Coming into ongoing DC Comics fresh as a daisy with DC’s New 52, Wonder Woman by Azzarello and Chiang was exactly what I needed to sell me on the character. Or perhaps more accurately, to sell me on the world of the character. In particular, Chiang’s designs of old fashioned Greek mythology inside the superhero landscape of the DC Universe was thrilling, whether talking about the dripping candle wax of Hades’ head or the Donkey Kong 64 water level boss proportions of Poseidon. In retrospect I don’t know how much this era of Wonder Woman really does for Diana (certain elements, like her true father, leave an increasingly sour taste), but it certainly sold me on a style I wasn’t finding almost anywhere else in the New 52. — DaveCreators: Scott Snyder, Greg CapulloIssues: Batman #1 to #52It may be lost to history, but when the New 52 started, it was Detective Comics – not Batman – that made all the headlines. That’s the book that gave up the longest running serialized issue count, and to top that, featured the Joker cutting off his own face in the first issue (which, lol)! Of course by the time Court of Owls was over, it was quickly evident that not only was Batman the superior book, but the creative team-up of Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo was going to turn some damn heads.   — DaveCreators: Peter Tomasi, Patrick Gleason, Andy KubertIssues: Batman and Robin #1 to #40, AnnualsBatman has had several partners in his journey to fight crime, however the challenge of working\n",

Splice together Morrison Batman and Ellisian espionage of the Wildstorm world, and you get this beautiful, charming spy book. From Midnighters to Maxwell Lords to Katherine Kanes, there was no corner Grayson wasn’t willing to touch.It posited the bold question: What if Dick Grayson wasn’t a lesser Batman in a lesser Gotham, but was instead a big, bold, narratively important figure in the DCU that was genuinely his own man? It pit the man known for his openness and lack of secrecy in circumstances that demanded he act against those instincts. From character conflict, turmoil, twists, sprawling mythology and big ideas, this was an ambitious, forward-facing title that had it all. Yes, even Dick Grayson’s butt, as The Midnighter notes with a sly grin. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Becky Cloonan, Branden Fletcher, Karl Kerschl, variousIssues: Gotham Academy #1 to #17What happens when you mix together Harry Potter and Slice Of Manga and set it in the context of a grand superheroic shared universe? That’s the crux of this wonderful title by Cloonan, Fletcher, brought to life by the terrific talents of Karl Kerschl. What is it like to be a student in Gotham, where Batmen, Clayfaces, and Robins are all real? What ancient horrors and mysteries lurk in the shadows? Is that professor just weird or is it a supervillain in disguise? Oh no, does that guy I like hate me?! Gotham Academy was very much an accessible, lovely entrypoint not only into the DCU, but superhero comics at large, catering to a YA crowd, and offering a diversification of the work seen in Big Two.It ended, but its spirit endures. It was warm, smart, emotional, and full of joy. It’s a book you can share with everyone. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Steve Orlando, ACO, Stephen Mooney, Alec MorganIssues: Midnighter #1 to #12While DC’s New 52 era Wildstorm Universe integration is generally an all-caps BAD IDEA, the fact that it spawned the incredible Midnighter solo series written by Steve Orlando honestly kind of saves the whole thing (as does the Midnighter and Apollo mini that followed!). Midnighter can get cynically and incorrectly reduced to “Gay Batman,” so Orlando and team are committed to fully fleshing out the hyper-violent, hyper-powerful vigilante, with as much insight into his love life, home life, and personality as his missions that lead to him punching out his own eardrums to avoid sonic hypnosis. Orlando’s a master at crafting extremely masculine queer characters who defy lingering stereotypes, and Midnighter is a fantastic fit among his work on the subject.  — DaveCreators: Tom King, Barnaby BagendaIssues: Omega Men #1 to #12Post-9/11 Star Wars. That’s it. That’s pretty much all you really need to know about this book, apart from the fact that it’s actually good, and not messy like The Prequels. Playing Kyle Rayner as the American Interventionist, in the Space Middle East that is The Vega System, the entire text is informed by writer Tom King’s own experiences in Iraq, and ends up a critique of US Interventionism, the messiness of war, the cyclical nature of violence. Rooted in King’s fascination with Alan Moore and Watchmen, the work is a 9-panel grid text, mimicking many of the storytelling techniques, right down to the end quotes.A formalist revamp of The Omega Men, it works as both the first and last story of the team, boasting propaganda poster-esque covers to Encyclopedia Galactica entries. This is proper DC Cosmic, it’s hard sci-fi, it’s about what war really is and does. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Mark Russell, Ben CaldwellIssues: Prez #1 to #6Have you ever read satire so real and biting, you almost watched it come true just months later, almost akin to prophecy? That was Prez. Mark Russell is a well known name now, having risen up with Flintstones, which everyone’s aware of. But the reason Flintstones exists is because of this book. Prez was a reboot of an old Joe Simon (Captain America co-creator) concept, about a kid president. It was meant to be a 12-part serialized satire. It unfortunately died at 6. This led to Russell opting for a strict one-and-done condensed storytelling approach, given his work could die fast like this one, leading to Flintstones.But despite its fate, it remains a terribly funny, haunting, and alarmingly accurate look at an America controlled by cruel corporate overlords and murderous politicians with no values, as conservativism and idiocy reign about, and so much feels lost. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Grant Morrison, VariousIssues: The Multiversity #1 And 2, The Multiversity Guidebook #1 And Multiversity Issues: The Society Of Super-Heroes #1, The Just #1, Pax Americana #1, Thunderworld #1, Mastermen #1 And Ultra Comics #1Grant Morrison’s epic, high concept, cosmic finale at DC Comics. Brewing for over half a decade, The Multiversity hit like a thundering revelation. If the prior Final Crisis drew up the myth of a Fifth World, this book delivered. It’s him in full Kirby mode. It’s the man in his 50s, much like The King in the ’70s, having done it all, returning with one big, final maelstrom of ideas, one giant monument of additive mythology. This is The Fifth World, and the ultimate cap-stone to everything he’s done at DC, and in Big Two comics, with a murderous row of top talent.It spans DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Astro Cities, and every superhero world ever made, and goes on further to make some more, and pits them against the ultimate eternal threat. A tremendous display of his range as a writer, able to pull off everything from Wagernian tragedy to Watchmen formalism, it’s a multiversal trip you’re likely to remember. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Peter Tomasi, Patrick GleasonIssues: Superman #1 to #45Superman is often referred to as ‘your dad’s superhero’. He is a hero that stands for truth and justice and is genuinely a strong role model in any young readers life. Superman as written by Tomasi and Gleason makes this abundantly clear by seeing Clark Kent as a father, committed to his family with Lois Lane, and their 10-year-old son, Jon Kent. The series explores the idea of both what it means to be Superman, and what young superpowered Jon must keep in mind growing up. The stories ranged from small adventures of Jon learning to use his abilities, mixed in with grand epic scale Superman stories of old. — Mikayla LairdCreators: James Tynion IV, Eddy Barrows, Alvoaro MartinezIssues: Detective Comics #934 to #981One of the most stale Batman stories for me is exploring the loss of Bruce Wayne’s humanity as his hyper-fixation on his crusade against crime increases. We get it, Bruce, you’re more bat than man, it truly is the dark knight of your soul, blah blah blah. That is why James Tynion IV’s Detective Comics is such a breath of fresh air; it’s about more than just dealing with Batman’s past moral compromises and the chipping away of his soul, it’s about how a new generation of heroes build upon his legacy to surpass him. Batwoman, Red Robin, and Clayface (in an enthralling new role as a hero) grapple with respecting the man who became Gotham’s greatest hero while still realizing Gotham deserves better. Neither hagiography nor damnation of the Dark Knight, Tynion’s Detective Comics feels clear-eyed and bold in its appraisal of Batman. — Zack DeaneCreators: Christopher Priest, Carlo Pagulayan, Ed Benes, VariousIssues: Deathstroke #1 to #50As one of the very few DC Rebirth launches that actually stuck with a consistent creative team for the first four years of the era, Deathstroke has gone from “Best Book of the Year” praise to forgotten old favorite over the years. It was only three years ago that comics critics were hailing the incredible “Chicago” issue for its approach to tackling inner city gun violence. Did Deathstroke drop off that much in quality as it kept going, or did we all just take it for granted? — DaveCreators: Gene Luen Yang, Viktor Bogdanovic, Billy TanIssues: New Super-Man #1 to #19Gene Yang is brilliant. We know this. Gene Yang was screwed over badly on Superman by Eddie Berganza. We also know this. Thrown into terrible mandated crossovers on his first foray into corporate capes, Yang was given a raw deal. But then something happened. Jim Lee proposed he do a Chinese Superman. Not Chinese-American, but Chinese. Yang didn’t want to. He hated the idea. But then he thought about it.And then he did what Yang does: Make a brilliant comic. What you have is a devilishly clever, curious work that’s about cultural conversations, how one culture informs another, how superheroes and politics intersect, and where the Superman falls into it all. But even as it is all that, while being an accessible exploration of the central DC ideas in a Chinese context, it’s also one that mines deep continuity to take a look at yellow peril and other ugly parts of the publisher’s past, going right back to Detective Comics #1. It’s fun, it’s honest, it’s fresh, it’s insightful, it’s what Gene Yang does best. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Peter Tomasi, Jorge JimenezIssues: Super Sons #1 to #16What happens when you put Damian Wayne, the 13-year-old assassin son of Batman, with Jonathan Kent, the half-Kryptonian 10-year-old son of Superman? Super Sons teams up the kids of two of DCs greatest superheroes in adventures that are fun, energetic and embraces the youthful spirit of both characters. Missions often find the serious and commanding Damian frustrated by Jon’s happy demeanor, and superpowered approach to the problem. Super Sons was short lived, but extremely entertaining and one that brings a smile to the face of its readers. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Marguerite Bennett, Marguerite SauvageIssues: Bombshells #1 to #33Anyone who reads Big Two comics is familiar with the excitement of picking up a series with a compelling premise only to realize that the intriguing concept is the only noteworthy thing going for it, with no follow-through that takes the idea someplace great. Well, if you like the idea of reimagining the women of DC as 1940’s American propaganda posters (think Rosie the Riveter as a superhero), I’m pleased to say that DC Comics: Bombshells, written by Marguerite Bennett, takes that fun concept and spins it into a unique and riveting Elseworlds story. In this WWII yarn, Kate Kane is a League-Of-Their-Own style major league baseball star (Batwoman as Bat Woman, get it?), Catwoman is a femme fatale straight out of a spy noir film, and Supergirl is the Soviets’ secret weapon. With the right balance of winking fun and grounded storytelling, Bombshells is the promise of a great concept fulfilled.– Zack DeaneCreators: Gerard Way, Nick DeringtonIssues: Doom Patrol #1 to #12Creators: Cecil Castellucci, Marley ZarconeIssues: Shade the Change Girl #1 to #12For its all too brief lifespan, DC’s Young Animal imprint, curated by longtime My Chemical Romance frontman, the leader the Black Parade himself, Gerard Way, was an injection of weird, inventive, and stylish fresh air. Clearly inspired by Grant Morrison and turn of the 90’s Vertigo Comics, Young Animal got to make the DC Universe weird again, and more often than not it succeeded. My two favorite successes from the era find Way and the incredible Nick Derington doing Morrison’s Doom Patrol justice (and then some), building off the inspirations to modernize and celebrate the wonderful legacy of the team. Cecil Castellucci and Marley Zarcone have more challenging hills to climb, recontextualizing the Shade the Changing Man franchise from Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo. Shade the Changing Girl becomes a fever dream meta exploration of everything from bullying to mental health. Rest in Power Young Animal.  — DaveCreators: Tom Taylor, Bruno Redondo, Mike Miller, VariousIssues: Injustice Gods Among Us Year One – Year FiveListen, not every comic can be as formally creative as Watchmen or thematically dense as Mister Miracle. And not every comic has to be! Sometimes there’s a simple joy in reading about a simple Elseworlds story done well, like“What if the Justice League was set in feudal Japan?” or “What if Batman teamed up with Houdini to fight vampires?”. Injustice: Gods Among Us asks the simple question, “If Superman was going to turn bad and conquer the Earth, how would that happen?” and follows through with that idea to its natural conclusions. Tom Taylor, tasked with the unenviable job of writing a digital comic based off of a Mortal Kombat style fighting game, crafted something vital enough that, 7 years later, I suspect the legacy of Injustice will be in the (still-ongoing) comic adaptation and not the games. — Zack DeaneCreators: Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, VariousIssues: Full Event/CrossoversOne of my 3 favorite Big 2 comic book events, definitely behind 2015’s Secret Wars, but giving my Age of Apocalypse nostalgia everything it can handle. Snyder and Capullo’s Metal (originally supposed to be called ‘Dark Crisis,’ and make no mistake, it fits well within DC’s Crisis narrative) is a victory lap following their celebrated New 52 Batman run. The event is equal parts dense (a degree in Morrison-ology and the Hawkman mythos are among the DC comics knowledge base that go a long way!), and chalk full of “ROCK ON” action that any comic reader can fist pump about (*ahem* Joker Dragons *ahem*). Plus, the full event reading order is way tighter than most sprawling crossovers! — DaveCreators: Tom King, Mitch GeradsIssues: Mister Miracle #1 to #12A stone cold classic from top to bottom. A comic that deserves, in 20 years time, to be so ubiquitously considered a masterpiece that jaded comic fans will roll their eyes at how obvious a choice it is for their favorite comic blog’s “Top Five Superhero Comics” list (realheads know this hidden gem called Watchmen is where it’s really at). Tom King and Mitch Gerads effortlessly weave a tale that encapsulates PTSD and depression, the banality and horrors of war, and the simple, everyday beauty of marriage. Rooted in the New Gods mythos Jack Kirby built in the 70s, Mister Miracle simultaneously taps into the legacy of the medium of comic books (my god, the nine panel grid usage here!) while still always showcasing King and Gerards’ singular style. This is a comic that demands to be read carefully, then read again, and then again. — Zack DeaneCreators: Grant Morrison, Liam Sharpe, Tom OrzechowskiIssues: The Green Lantern #1 to #12, Blackstars #1 to #3, The Green Lantern Season Two #1 to #12I’ve cooled a bit on season two, but season one sure got John and I excited!— DaveCreators: Gene Luen Yang, GurihiruIssues: Superman Smashes the Klan #1 to #3A story dating back to the 1940s but retold and strengthened as its message radiates just as much now as it did then. Superman is pitted against the Klan of the Fiery Cross, as a Chinese American family move to Metropolis and find themselves the subjects of racial attacks. The children of the family find themselves the most heavily effected, and work with Superman to begin to understand the reasoning behind the attacks, and possibly save another child from falling into that mindset. The story ties the ideas of alienation to both the children, as well as Clark’s own feelings about himself. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Kurt Busiek, John Paul LeonIssues: Batman: Creature of the Night #1 to #4Young Bruce Wainwright is obsessed with Batman, especially due to the similarity to his own name. Bruce begins to find as many connections he can, even taking joy in the fact that he has an Uncle Alfred. It’s all fun and games, until his parents are murdered in a robbery gone wrong. Now young Bruce is on his own in the world, granted, he is supported by his reasonably large inheritance. But he can’t shake the feeling that it’s all part of a conspiracy, which is only strengthened when a Bat like creature begins to appear to Bruce. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Brian Michael Bendis, Nick DeringtonIssues: Batman: Universe #1 to #6What do you get when you force Brian Michael Bendis to ditch his decompression and force him to compress story into 12-pagers? Some of the best, most tight work of his career that boasts everything you love about the iconic writer. With artist extraordinaire Nick Derington as his partner, Bendis builds his own, personal vision of Batman, which disposes of dull attempts at ‘realism’ and ‘seriousness’, and instead opts for a high-energy operatic adventure, a Brave and the Bold-style voyage across the great canvas of the DC Universe.It’s accessible, it’s fun, it’s filled to the brim with everything you love about superhero universes and comics, from gimmicky-criminals, western gunslingers to crazy cosmic beings. A travelogue that lets Derington cut loose and put together the tapestry of the DCU for both old readers and new alike, it’s a trip that’s more about the journey than the destination. It’s not about plot, but it is about great moments. — Ritesh BabuCreators: NK Jemesin, Jamal CampbellIssues: Far Sector #1 to #12If you told me in early 2019 that DC was going to introduce another Green Lantern in their own solo book (and not only another Green Lantern, another human Green Lantern), I can’t imagine being less curious. But when it was revealed that three-time Hugo award winning sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin was writing this new 12 issue maxi-series for DC’s Young Animal imprint, my ears perked up. And the series did not disappoint. A self-contained story of murder and social upheaval on a faraway world, Far Sector allows Jemisin to flex her worldbuilding muscles. With Jamal Campbell’s stunning art, The City Enduring is quickly established as a fascinating locale, both familiar and alien in its intricacies. And by the time you get a few issues into this series, the bold new Green Lantern, Sojourner “Jo” Mullein, might just have you saying “Hal who?” — Zack DeaneFiled Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:00 amFirst off, I want ot say I love your page. Your reading orders have been essential for me since getting back to reading comics a couple of years back, after an absence of over 20 years! I’m glad to say i’ve read the vast majority of these comics, and agree they are fantastic comics. There are, however, some big omissions, namely, most of al, The Sandman.\n",
      "Its as influential and fantastic as a comic can be. If Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits makes the cut, despite being a Vertigo title, then so should Sandman. Books of Magic as well, while we are at it.Sandman is very explicitly within the larger super-hero DC universe, as Mr. Miracle, Dr. Destiny, The Scarecrow, Martian Manhunter feature on it, and even Batman appears in one panel, for example. Places like Arham Asylium are also featured in the series. My suggestion? Lump Batman Inc with Morrison’s Batman run (it belongs there anyway, as its a direct continuation of his previous Bartman work). This way, you have a empty spot to put The Sandman in. Come on, you know it deserves to be in this list.\n",
      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:33 amOh, and I’d lump The Black Mirror with Batman by Scott Snyder, and replace it with Paul Dini’s Detective Comics and Streets of Gotham run, and call it Batman, by Paul Dini.\n",
      "Paul says March 24, 2021 at 2:11 amI think Greg Rucka’s Wonder Woman run is issues #195-226 if I’m not mistaken.\n",
      "Cyril says October 31, 2020 at 10:06 pmSeeing Mad Love in the list I can’t help to suggest Harleen by Stjepan Sejic. Aside from the godlike art, it elevates Mad Love to a psyche study of Harleen Quinzel. Did I mention the awesome art?\n",
      "Ryan says September 3, 2020 at 1:49 amA really fantastic list that I have only one problem with: There’s a few stories on this list that could have been listed together in order to free up an extra spot.  I’m thinking Batman Inc. could have been added to Morrison’s Batman and The Black Mirror could have gone with Batman by Snyder. I’d have to go through the list again but I think there is at least one other instance of something like this.  Now I have no idea what you would add instead though.  Anyways, this list is going to be great to go through. Its been about 5 years since you did the Marvel one so I’d love to see an update.  Also, I’d love to see another company or imprint as well.  Thank you!\n",
      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:04 amAgree with that notion. Batan Inc could be included in the Morrison run, and Black Mirror on Snyder’s.I’d replace the Batman Inc spot with The Sandman, and the Black Mirror spot with either The Books of Magic, Hellblazer: All His Engines or Family Man, or Tynion’s Justice League Dark myself.Your email address will not be published.

It also touches on numerous issues like religion, class, and race.The storyline illustrates the conflict between the JL and Legion of Doom in regaining control in the world.

Each of them would be perfectly suited to a different comic book genre.The comic industry operates on a number of different genres in order to keep the stories feeling varied. Often characters can be defined by certain genres, with their books normally reflecting the sort of tone and atmosphere associated with the comic category.RELATED: 10 Young Avengers Ranked By How Good They Would Be As Leader Of The AvengersThe Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, reflect a whole range of comic genres therefore. Not only are they one of the greatest assembly of superheros, but they also bring together completely different categories for writers to explore. Here is some of the most prominent Avengers matched up to the genres that they are associated with.The web-slinger is known for a very specific thing. While his scientific mind and his heroic heart are both admirable, it's his sense of humor that has brought in the most fans.Spider-Man is quick witted and usually sarcastic. His comics are often associated with science fiction and fantasy, with some adventure elements. The common theme in every single one though is comedy. Spider-Man is one of the funniest Marvel characters.The war genre isn't as common within comics as it is within the movies. While the cinema will often showcase famous historical battles, comics don't tend to revisit past conflicts too often.Due to his origin, the nature of the enemies he fights and even his costume design, Captain America fits into the war genre perfectly. The inspirational leader is used to leading troops into battle, based on his ideological principles.She-Hulk has become famous for many things over the years. She may have broken the fourth wall and have been one of the strongest female Avengers to ever grace the ranks of the team.RELATED: 5 Reasons Why The Avengers' Trinity Could Beat The Justice League's (& 5 Why They Can't)But first and foremost she is a talented lawyer. The courtroom is often where she wages war, turning many of her comics into legal dramas, something that could be carried over to the future Disney+ show.Mythology, magical, monsters and different dimensions, everything about the Thor franchise links back to fantasy in some way. This has extended to other characters with the likes of Hercules and Doctor Strange following suit.The genre is a huge part of the Marvel Universe and Thor and his supporting cast really reflect that. With Jane Foster now taking on the title, the future of the fantasy genre is in capable hands.While teams like the Guardians of the Galaxy are usually responsible for what is beyond the Avengers' protection, Captain Marvel is the Avenger who defies this idea.Everywhere is under the protection of Carol Danvers, who completely embodies science fiction. The genre is more than just aliens and spaceships, it usually reflects a number of cultural and societal issues often faced closer to home.The noir genre is dark and gritty, bringing in crime and detective elements alongside deep emotional issues. Jessica Jones is a great demonstration of this category.RELATED: Marvel: 10 Moments That Changed The Comic Universe's History ForeverHer Alias arc really took on this tone and she is one of the best detectives in the Marvel Universe. Her own grit and determination takes the genre into new territory.The martial arts genre is one that is difficult to convey in comic form. There's a few characters that manage to embody the spirit and the essence of the category, asides from just the physical aspects.Iron Fist and Colleen Wing come to mind, but none more so than Shang-Chi who is often described as the master of the martial arts. The strength of his bravery is shown by the way he steps into battle every time, with nothing more than his fists.Adventure is about new discoveries, creative problem solving and dynamic action. There's a certain tone that's usually difficult to his but both Ant-Man and the Wasp convey the right atmosphere.While it is cheating to include both heroes, it's difficult to talk about one without the other. The genre really works when they are together and can use their powers in unique ways in order to continue on their adventure.Ghost Rider has served on a couple of variations of the Avengers but isn't often known for working with others. Despite this, he is a valuable teammate and one of the few Marvel characters that brings horror elements with him.His link to hell and dark magic allows him to stand out and become useful when facing equally terrifying threats. The design of the character alone is perfect for the stories told with him.Espionage and spies are a huge part of many action comics now. It's almost becoming a lost genre but Black Widow manages to keep the tone of this category alive.Espionage comics and even films play on the thriller vibe of a few other genres, while also linking the intelligent thought processes sometimes associated with the crime genre.NEXT: 10 Comic Genres Matched With Members Of The Justice LeaguePolitics graduate, freelance writer and all around film geek.

      "The Best Marvel Comics of 2017 (So Far)Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJuly 2, 2017 by Dave 4 Comments There’s a prevailing theme in comics coverage this year that Marvel Comics are in a state of unrelenting disaster. Marvel has done little to assuage these fears, with PR disaster after PR disaster, and an uncanny mutant ability to stick a foot directly in a mouth.In truth, it’s been a startling fall from grace for Marvel since the conclusion of 2015’s Secret Wars – actually since October 2016, when Marvel bewilderingly decided to release the start of All-New All-Different Marvel 3 MONTHS before Secret War had even ended. After spending the vast majority of the 2010’s in control of the Big 2 power rankings, and watching DC Comics bumble through (an increasingly underrated) New 52, Marvel found themselves directionless and without a map in 2016.As I wrote in last year’s year-end “best of,” there were plenty of good Marvel Comics throughout 2016 if you knew where to look. Time after time, though, these books were not the tried and true staples of Marvel past, with an absence of Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Avengers, or X-Men anywhere on my 2016 best-of list.2017 continues this trend, with Marvel still fumbling around in the dark before their Legacy initiative attempts to right the ship. Nonetheless, there ARE good Marvel Comics out there, sometimes on the fringes, and sometimes right up in the center of the Marvel Universe.These are my favorite Marvel Comics of 2017 (so far).Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!Issues out: 4Collected: Royals Vol. 1: Beyond InhumanCreative team: Al Ewing, Jonboy MeyersI had minimal expectations for a new comic starring the royal family of Marvel’s Inhumans. Issue #1 sets a great tone, though, with series writer Al Ewing launching the Inhumans into space (always a good start – just ask Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye) and revealing Black Bolt isn’t who we think he is (unless you already think he’s who we aren’t supposed to think he is, in which case, you thought right).Honestly, this is the most invested I’ve been in post Secret Wars Inhumans, despite Marvel’s many efforts to place the longtime Fantastic Four cameos front and center in the universe. Ewing has a great track record with his Marvel work on the Ultimates, and the recent appearance of Ronan the Accuser in Royals #4 suggests this could be the next great Ewing cosmic comic.Issues out: 5Collected: The Unworthy ThorCreative team: Jason Aaron, Oliver CoipelI did not expect Unworthy Thor to stand out as much as it did, but the miniseries addressing the Odinson’s fall from Mjolnir’s graces really delivered. This is especially true if you’ve been keeping up with Jason Aaron’s run on Thor since God of Thunder in 2012. Unworthy Thor finally explains what happened in 2014’s Original Sin, and how it lead to the Odinson’s standing as unworthy. While years long secrets are an exceedingly overexploited trick in comics, Aaron actually pulls off the reveal with a clear connection to the themes of his now 5 year run on the lords of Asgard.Coipel’s art is great throughout, with surprising cosmic elements and appearances from Beta Ray Bill, the Collector, and several others I won’t spoil.Issues out: 5Collected: Secret EmpireCreative team: Nick Spencer, Andrea Sorrentino,Well. Hello there. Any chance you have an opinion on Secret Empire? I thought as much.I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a superhero comic book event create as much of a firestorm as Secret Empire, beginning all the way back in April 2016 with Captain America: Steve Rogers #1. If the reveal that Captain America is an agent of Hydra, and Marvel’s disturbingly confrontational approach to criticism, is several steps too far for you to even consider reading, I respect that. Secret Empire has offended a lot of Captain America fans and comic book readers, and that’s a reality requiring reconciliation.Looking at this as another in a long line of comic book events, Secret Empire is genuinely quite good, and miles better than Civil War 2 (sure, that’s a bar set in the dirt, but it’s a bar nonetheless). I loved Spencer’s work on Morning Glories and Superior Foes of Spider-Man, liked his work on Ant-Man, and have been consistently disappointed by his runs on both Sam Cap and Cap Steve. Secret Empire is a step up from the Cap runs, and makes effective use of the Marvel Universe and present day political fears permeating America. You’ll never convince me Secret Empire wouldn’t have been more effective as the Marvel alternate-reality version of DC’s Injustice, but as it stands it’s an event that I consistently want to know more about.Issues out: 21Collected: Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol. 6Creative team: Ryan North, Erica HendersonUnbeatable Squirrel Girl is absolutely delightful, and remains the pinnacle of Marvel’s whimsical fare like Gwenpool or the Unstoppable Wasp. At this point, if you’ve given Unbeatable Squirrel Girl a chance and found it’s not serious enough for you, nothing here will change your mind. BUT, if you’ve been holding off on Squirrel Girl because… Squirrel Girl? For real? Yes, Doreen Green’s for real, and no series in Marvel kicks as many butts or eats as many nuts.Issues out: 15Collected: Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet Vol. 3Creative team: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian StelfreezeThe one consistent complaint I’ve seen against Black Panther is that the book is straight up boring. Frequently this criticism comes from long time superhero readers who have a certain expectation for Marvel comics.Personally, I’m willing to play the long game with Black Panther and Ta-Nehisi Coates, and see what Coates can do with the full benefit of an extended run. Black Panther wears its Jonathan Hickman influences on its sleeve – going so far as to spiral out of Hickman’s established character continuity – and the book reminds me most of works like New Avengers or East of West. Character’s spout impossibly well articulated philosophies in the midst of heated debate, and it’s highbrow, intellectual candy all the way through.Issues out: 2Collected: Black BoltCreative team: Saladin Ahmed, Christian WardDespite his power levels and prominence as Marvel’s Midnight King, Black Bolt’s inability to, you know, *speak* has prevented him from his own solo series until now. The vow of silence creates unique creative challenges, the sort you’ll see brilliantly handled in Jeff Loveness’ 2015 Groot solo series or in the “deaf” Hawkeye issues by Matt Fraction and David Aja.So far, the Black Bolt creative team hs circumvented these challenges exquisitely, with a visually addictive narrative about Blackagar Boltagon trapped in the prison designated for his brother, Maximums the Mad. It’s early in the run, and we’ll see how much power Black Bolt truly has in store, but to date, there’s a lyrical quality to Black Bolt not found in many other Marvel Comics and it’s well worth the price of admission.Issues out: 8Collected: Ultimates 2 Vol. 1: TroubleshootersCreative team: Al Ewing, Travel ForemanAl Ewing and Kenneth Rocafort’s Ultimates was my single favorite Marvel comic of 2016, and has proven its worth as the best Marvel cosmic comic in the post Secret Wars era. After a Civil War 2 tie-in, and a series relaunch, Ultimates has lost some steam, but Al Ewing and new series artist Travel Foreman still have some great ideas up their sleeve.This was most clear during the series latest release, when Galactus took on Ego the Living Planet in a completely new and fascinating manner. As any long time Thor reader knows, Galactus vs. Ego battles are nothing new, but Ewing puts a completely different spin on the seemingly predictable outcome (Galactus attaching a giant rocket to Ego with the aid of Thor and launching him into space).I’m optimistic that given room to grow (it won’t get it, but hey, dreams) Ultimates could have gone down alongside the Abnett and Lanning era of Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy.Issues out: 14Collected: Moon Knight Vol. 3: Birth and DeathCreative team: Jeff Lemire, Greg SmallwoodMoon Knight has been riding a comic series high since Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey redefined Mr. Knight. Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood have taken the comic series to even more experimental heights with an untraceable blend of fact and fiction. Moon Knight’s multiple personalities have always made him an unreliable narrator, but placed in the confines of a mental institute, it’s even murkier how much of Moon Knight’s “truth” is a real part of his hero’s journey.Most important of all, Lemire and Smallwood are making one of the least conventional superhero comics out there, proving that a medium defined more by consistency than experimentation still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve.Issues out: 9Collected: Infamous Iron Man Vol. 2: The Absolution of DoomCreative team: Brian Michael Bendis, Alex MaleevYou won’t find many comic book sites celebrating the work of Bendis and Maleev harder than Comic Book Herald. Their early 2000’s Daredevil was one of my first favorite Marvel Unlimited loves, and I even enjoyed the heck out of their Spider-Woman and split personality Moon Knight vs. Ultron head twelve issues.Infamous Iron Man is a… tougher conceptual sell. With Tony Stark sidelined by his Civil War 2 coma, Victor Von Doom, the most notorious and greatest villain in comics, has taken up the mantle of the Infamous Iron Man (although I’m fairly certain he leaves the ‘infamous’ part out on his business cards).Issues out: 8Collected: Thanos Vol. 1: Thanos ReturnsCreative team: Jeff Lemire, Mike DeodatoWhen it comes to Thanos, I’m a bit protective. In general, I’ve maintained that very few creators should even attempt to touch the Mad Titan, aside from our cosmic overmind Jim Starlin. Over the past 20 years, the only creator who managed to tell a Thanos story that passed this test was Jonathan Hickman, aka the writer responsible for the best author-verse in Marvel since Chris Claremont.Jeff Lemire and Mike Deodato have astonishingly already proved up to the challenge with their launch of a solo Thanos series. Simply put, Thanos is excellent, likely even better than Starlin’s own take on a Thanos solo series in 2003 to 2004. If you like Marvel cosmic, or series starring “villains,” Thanos is a can’t miss.Note for new readers, that Thanos is very much reliant on your familiarity with the past 5 or so years of continuity, including Hickman’s generals of Thanos as well as Thane, son of Thanos. The series also occurs in the wake of Secret Wars, with a notably weakened Thanos attempting to take back his rightful position as a galactic nightmare.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured If you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "My Favorite DC Comics of 2017!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansDecember 18, 2017 by Dave 6 Comments In terms of what’s on the actual comic book page (and not who’s working in the actual comic book office), DC Comics had a terrific 2017. The earned respect and praise of DC Rebirth carried through much of a year that saw the best event in superhero comics (Metal) and easily the year’s most respected “superhero” title in Mister Miracle.Simply put, there are a number of worthy options for a top 5 DC Comics of the year list, and it’s a testament to the continued success of the line. Marvel may play the numbers game well enough to stave off financial ruin, but ask any Wednesday warrior who’s winning the Big 2 battle right now, and it’s DC.Below you’ll find my favorite DC Comics of 2017. Each of these series continues into 2018, meaning there’s still time to add it to your pull list.In most cases, you can find DC Rebirth or Young Animal trades also available on Hoopla. I highly recommend giving the service a look if you’re interested in catching up on any of the select titles.There isn’t a single Young Animal title that isn’t at least interesting (you’ll find plenty of fans upset this slot didn’t go to Shade, The Changing Girl), but it’s so easy to imagine a parallel universe where Doom Patrol went horribly wrong. After all, a famous rock star trying to capture the idiosyncrasies and madcap vision of Grant Morrison on DC’s weirdest team? This could have gotten ugly quickly.Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!Instead, Doom Patrol is endlessly entertaining, and it’s first arc contains the best running gag in perhaps a decade of comics (“What’s Up With Niles Caulder”). I’m deliriously excited for the Doom Patrol / Justice League crossover “Milk Wars” in early 2018, and you can too! I’ve loved every minute of DC’s Kamandi Challenge, and honestly, prior to this I hadn’t read a page of Jack Kirby’s Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth in my life.To celebrate what would have been the King’s 100th birthday, DC announced a twelve issue limited series, with a variety of renowned creators taking the “Kamandi Challenge.” Essentially each creative team writes a Kamandi story, then leaves an impossible cliffhanger for the next creative team to try and solve. It’s a really fun process and look inside the craft of excellent writers and artists like Neal Adams, Walt Simonson, and Marguerite Bennett (among many others).It would seem like a no-brainer to include Superman on a year-end DC Comics list, but it’s actually been a long time coming since the Man of Steel could reasonably be placed among the DC Universe’s best. The reintroduction of Superman’s family with DC Rebirth has immensely helped the character, and Clark, Lois, and son Jon form one of the most compelling families in comics.Likewise, Superman has finally been restored to one of the titles in the driver’s seat of the DC Universe, with stories like “Superman: Reborn” driving the entire DCU straight to Doomsday Clock.Superhero comics are so chalk full of events now (thanks Marvel!) you’d be forgiven if yet another escaped your interest. In the case of Dark Nights: Metal, you’d be missing out on the best Crisis-level event of the decade. The New 52 Batman creative team of Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo is back together for their most cosmic, adrenaline-infused Batman story yet, a Bat-centric event with the entire multiverse at stake.Perhaps the best aspect of Metal is that it’s a tightly crafted story with only limited tie-ins. Better, most of the tie-ins are one-shots unique to the story, and don’t interrupt previous ongoings. The titles that are interrupted for Metal flow organically, and only for a single issue at a time.I’m not exaggerating when I say Metal is the most passionate I’ve been about a comic book series since Secret Wars (2015). This isn’t quite that good (yet) but I’m filled with joy every time a new issue hits the stands.This is intentional hyperbole: Tom King is fast reaching Alan Moore status. King brings a level of sophistication and brilliance to each and every comic book series he writes that is typically unheard of in comics. Through works such as Vision, Sheriff of Babylon, and Omega Men, King has established himself as a can’t miss comic book author.Even though King is writing DC’s Batman (a series that has reached new highs toward the close of 2017), it’s his twelve issue limited series, Mister Miracle, with artist Mitch Gerads that is defying all expectations of what a superhero comic book can and should be. Mister Miracle is the kind of comic that makes you want to read, make, and talk about comics in a crazed rush of ambition to make everything this damn good.Mister Miracle won’t be for every reader. It’s a strange book, without any sort of traditional superhero structure, and I’d argue a love of Jack Kirby’s New Gods is largely essential for enjoyment. Nonetheless, this isn’t just my favorite DC comic of 2017, it’s my pick for comic of the year.Doomsday ClockBatman White KnightDeathstrokeBug!The Wildstorm What do you think?

      "Kyle says December 21, 2017 at 10:59 pmI very much respect your opinion and will be checking out a few of these. However, after feeling swamped by marvel and not connecting to where a lot of my favorite characters are going I (gasp) picked up a DC Rebirth trade Batman(Tom King). It has been fantastic and brought back my excitement with comics. This coming from a mainly Marvel fan boy. I can attest to Tom Kings Batman and really want to check out some of his other stuff. I have branched out quite a lot into DC Rebirth but have kinda side stepped Superman. Are all of the titles that good? Or, is it just the main book?\n",
      "Dave says December 22, 2017 at 10:27 amHonestly, if I had made this list a week later, Batman would be right at the top. I’m generally positive about the run, but the last three issues have been extraordinary. Batman Annual #2 is one of my favorite single comics of the year (and of the past several years). It’s fantastic 🙂I like Superman and Action Comics. I am not caught up on Super Sons or New Superman. Rebirth has had a very high level of consistency across the board, so I recommend checking out as much as you can and sticking with what works.\n",
      "Taylor Carr says December 24, 2017 at 8:12 pmI agree that DC Rebirth is excellent overall and way ahead of Marvel right now. I started off with comics by reading Marvel (thanks to help from your guide, starting at ANAD Marvel). The Marvel is 90+% mediocre to me, even as such a new reader. I’ve dropped the majority of the series I’ve started from them in the past few years. I still enjoy the Star Wars comics and try the 1st issue of all their new series, but I really wish it would get better. I’m cautiously optimistic for when Legacy comes to Marvel Unlimited.DC Rebirth is a different story. I am voraciously obsessed with getting into this universe. I’ve read all completed events besides Superman Reborn and Titans Lazarus Contract. I’m also trying to read the first volume of every series and only have a few left. DC Metal looks amazing and I can’t wait to start that.Anyway, happy holidays to you and thanks for everything you do on this site! Most of what I know about comics now is thanks to you!\n",

      "So Captain America and Iron Man walk into a bar: Who gets served first?Let’s just see.With the success of Black Panther so far this year and the release of Avengers: Infinity War coming Friday, April 27, we wondered: Which Marvel movie characters are the most popular? We couldn’t resist a deep data dive. See below for our findings.But first, how is popularity determined?  Among 30 characters who received first, second, or third billing in the Marvel movies released so far, it’s no small feat for Ant-Man to start our list off at #10. Paul Rudd’s role was worth an estimated $4.8M in his 2015 eponymous film’s opening weekend.Actress Gwenyth Paltrow received second billing in both Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3, making her portrayal worth an estimated average of $5.2M. Now that’s gotta cover all the damage Tony has wreaked upon their home.Black Panther’s opening weekend was so big that even its second-billed role — that of villain Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan — was worth $6.9M. Don’t go spending that all on one big piece of vibranium, OK, Erik?Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange is valued at an estimated $7.2M to place him at No. 7. Hopefully, he has zippers on those pockets so that when he turns the world sideways, all that money doesn’t fall out.The only “alien” on our list is none other than Asgard’s own Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth. At this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor has starred in three of his own movies, and also received second billing in Avengers: Age of Ultron, worth an estimated average of $7.4M.While an estimated $8.9M won’t turn back time for Chris Evans’ Captain America, it does place him halfway down our list. He’s also starred in three of his own movies, but apparently, resonates a bit more with moviegoers than the hammer-wielding god just above.Now what can a high schooler like Peter Parker — played by Tom Holland — do with an estimated $9.8M? Certainly that should mean he no longer has to sell photos of his superhero self to the newspaper, right? Oh man, oh man. Just think of how many vintage mixtapes $10.1M can get Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord. That’s how much opening-weekend money we estimated two starring roles in Guardians of the Galaxy movies have earned him.Now we’re getting to the big leagues. Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man is the original Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero, and has received top billing in seven out of the 18 movies released so far. That’s earned him an averaged value of $10.7M.So you can believe the hype. The opening weekend of Black Panther brought in $201.8M, which puts its titular role, played by Chadwick Boseman, in first place here, worth an estimated $17M all by himself. Wakanda superhero can match that? None.\n",

      "screenrant.comThe 10 Best Marvel Comic Books Of 2021Marvel Comics had a great year in 2021, and its best books include stories from popular heroes like the Guardians of the Galaxy and Daredevil.There were a lot of great comics released in 2021 and Marvel had a big year itself. The company continued to tell the tales of the mutants changing lives in Krakoa while also delivering big stories with the introduction of a new Phoenix on Earth and the return of a classic Thor character that turned his life upside down.RELATED: 10 Unpopular Opinions About X-Men Comics, According To RedditEven with all those stories, they didn't rank among the best of the year for Marvel Comics. Marvel's best comics of 2021 featured long-form storytelling, a mishmash of genres, science fiction adventures, political intrigue, and one of the most horrific superhero stories Marvel has told in years.If there was one comic book that had a little bit of everything in 2021, it was Captain Marvel. Kelly Thompson threw everything but the kitchen sink at Carol Danvers, and it all seemed to stick. This all really started with Carol being thrown into a post-apocalyptic future with Namor's son in control.That led to Carol returning to her time and trying to gain magical powers, despite Doctor Strange trying to stop her. It all came to a head with Captain Marvel in an all-out battle with Vox Supreme, and through it all, Captain Marvel was one of the most consistently entertaining Marvel Comics of 2021.Iron Man took a dark turn in 2021. In his new solo title by Christopher Cantwell and Cafu, things got off to an intriguing start as the general public was turning on Iron Man. He tried to respond by becoming more relatable, but that made even more people hate him. He then got dumped by Wasp and ended up almost killing himself multiple times in battles with villains.It took another broken soul in Hellcat to show him what he was doing to himself. That new romance was a great addition to the comics, but then things really exploded when Iron Man had to battle a returning Korvac and took a team of misfits with him into outer space to stop the would-be-god. Between Tony's self-destructive behavior and the fun new team, Iron Man was one of the best reads of 2021.With Moon Knight coming to Disney+, Marvel began working him back into a more prominent role in the comics. It all started with Moon Knight battling the Avengers with Mephisto and Khonshu at war. However, when that ended, Jed McKay and Alessandro Cappuccio started the Moon Knight solo comic and it was brilliant.RELATED: The Coolest Storylines Marvel's Moon Knight Could Adapt from The ComicsMoon Knight now worked as a protector on the streets, almost like a priest who ensured that everyone, even vampires, could live in peace without people trying to kill them. Add in his required therapy sessions and a new disciple of Khonshu wanting to take over, and this was a book that was as bizarre and captivating as Moon Knight fans could ever want.Guardians of the Galaxy has been changing a lot over the last couple of years. The creative duo of Al Ewing and Juann Cabal has taken the superhero team, which looks completely dissimilar to what fans are used to, and told some of the best stories in Marvel Comics in 2021.Star-Lord is very different since he died and returned with the actual powers of a star, now one of the Guardians of the Galaxy's most powerful members. Hercules was a fantastic addition and the diversity he and Moondragon bring to the book helps it stand out. While the Doctor Doom story was a little off, that was just a blip in an otherwise fantastic 2021 for the Marvel Cosmic team.There were a lot of big stories in the world of mutants in 2021. From The Trial of Magneto to the Hellfire Gala to the great stories in The New Mutants and The X-Men returning to the United States, there was a lot going on in Krakoa. However, the best comic from the world of mutants was Hellions.This book took some of the most bizarre mutants in Krakoa and put them together on a team that made X-Force look tame in comparison. With Psylocke and Havok leading the way, under the command of Mister Sinister, this book ended up being the Marvel equivalent to the Suicide Squad, and was in turns hilarious and exciting, bringing the best out of the mutant's books.Chip Zdarsky and Marco Checceto created one of the best Daredevil stories told in years. In this series, Daredevil accidentally killed a man and refused to let it go. Instead, he agreed to serve time in prison for the murder, only to find everyone there wanted him dead.Matt Murdock's guilt is old news by now, but this series brought something fresh, with its side stories. Elektra took on the role of Daredevil to protect Hell's Kitchen, Bullseye was resurrected, and Kingpin and Typhoid Mary had a shocking relationship build throughout the story. This was Daredevil the way he was meant to be written.Nick Spencer finished his run on Amazing Spider-Man with a massive sprawling story that tied everything he had built together for an explosive climax. Kindred showed up a few years back and tormented Spider-Man and Norman Osborn.By the end of 2021, Kindred's identity was revealed and Spider-Man battled almost all his greatest villains. However, 2021 saw Spencer take the notorious One More Day and fix the problems it caused in a fantastic manner. By the end, he had changed the heroes and some of the villains in ways that should pay off in the years to come.Marvel has tried to have Black Cat comics in the past, but when Jed MacKay and CF Villa took over with her 2021 series, something finally clicked. Black Cat ended up in several big crossover events and proved to be more than capable of holding her own.RELATED: Spider-Man: No Way Home's Main Characters, Ranked By IntelligenceThe Black Cat series helped tie into some of the events, including her role with Spider-Man in his battle with Kindred and Felicia playing a very important role in the King in Black storyline. When the comic scaled back and let her deal with her battle with the Thieves Guild, things really heated up.Al Ewing wrapped up his run on Immortal Hulk, which ended up as the best Hulk series in a very long time. With the series ending in 2021, all the mysteries that Ewing introduced, from the One Below to the Green Door were finally revealed and Hulk and his allies were able to finally move on.This was the most horrific series that Marvel produced when it came to the main comic lines, with Hulk dying more than once. He morphed and changed, with the entire world seeming against him while he just tried to survive. Next to Peter David's Hulk run, Immortal Hulk is the best of the best.Ta-Nehisi Coates turned in one of the most groundbreaking runs on Black Panther in the character's history. After that, he started his run on Captain America and presented a story that was as topical as it was exciting. Coates dared to take the Red Skull and make him an internet sensation with Americans wanting to follow him over the more stoic Captain America.With the idea of Americans following a fascist villain, and believing he is the better option, this might be a hard read for some fans. However, the story was well written, both sides were given depth, and this saw Captain America and his allies have to question how they could deal with a country that was turning on itself.NEXT: The 10 Best Sam Wilson Stories In The Comic BooksShawn S.

      "The Best Marvel Comics of 2016 (That You Can Binge on Marvel Unlimited Right Now!)Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansNovember 16, 2016 by Dave 6 Comments We’re approaching the end of 2016, which means it’s time to evaluate the best reads from this year to keep you current with Marvel. The vast majority of these picks have been running long enough that you can read at least the first volume or story arc in full on Marvel Unlimited (there are notable exceptions).For the most part, you’ll notice that the best of 2016 largely steers clear of traditional big name books like Avengers, Spider-Man, or X-Men. Likewise, Marvel’s Civil War 2 has featured some compelling ideas, but has been tedious to actually follow in full, never actualizing like some of Marvel’s best events.But we aren’t here to talk about what went wrong – it’s time for the best Marvel comics of the year!Creators: Greg Pak, Frank ChoFirst Issue Published: December 2, 2015Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

It’s an appropriate last chance to celebrate the definitive Frank Castle artist of the 2000’s then, and Becky Cloonan’s story matches the energy you’d expect for the Punisher.Creators: G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, Takeshi MiyazawaFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: You will 100% enjoy this more if you’ve read Ms. Marvel’s debut during Marvel Now! (see also: the first four volumes).Collected: Ms. Marvel Vol. 5: Super FamousAt this point, Ms. Marvel suffers for simply being very good as opposed to dizzyingly great. 2016 has been a very interesting year for Ms. Marvel, as she’s fully transitioned from charming outsider to full-fledged All-New Avenger. The transition has been far from seamless, and if you think Avenger status feels like too much, too soon, those are themes Ms. Marvel’s creators are wrestling with as well.I expect we still have plenty of great Ms. Marvel yet to come from this creative lineup, as G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, and Takeshi Miyazawa have even pulled surprisingly inventive storytelling techniques out of Civil War 2, drawing from real life civil war and immigration where other books have passively taken the conflict at face value.Creators: Charles Soule, Ron GarneyFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: Two approaches here – Either catch up with the Mark Waid era of Daredevil during Marvel NOW!, or completely ignore all recent history and just accept that Daredevil’s basically back to status quo we know and love from, say, Daredevil Netflix (sort of).Collected: Daredevil: Back in Black Vol. 1: ChinatownSoule and Garney get a ton of credit for raising Daredevil to above average quality after the excellent Waid era didn’t leave a lot of room to run.It’s not a game-changer, but Daredevil taking a protege (he turns invisible; of course he turns invisible) opens up some new dimensions for the hero of Hell’s Kitchen. Simply put, it’s what you want out of reading Daredevil comics.Creators: Jason Aaron, Russell DautermanFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: This story-line all begins with Thor Vol. 1: The Goddess of ThunderCollected: Mighty Thor Vol. 1: Thunder in Her VeinsNow that Jason Aaron’s Thor: God of Thunder transition has gotten out of the beleaguered and unfortunate “Who is the Red Hulk?!” phase, we’re starting to see again what made Aaron, here with art from Russell Dauterman, such a master of the Asgardian realm. Creators: Jason Aaron, Chris BachaloFirst Issue Published: October 7, 2015Continuity Connections?: References Doctor Strange’s continuity throughout the 2000’s, so either read the Comic Book Herald Marvel Reading Order, or just pick up from here and enjoy.Collected: Doctor Strange Vol. 1: The Way of the WeirdJason Aaron has a track record for some of my favorite comics (Scalped, Southern Bastards) as well as some of my favorite Marvel Comics (Wolverine & the X-Men, Thor: God of Thunder), so I may have built up unrealistic expectations for his run on Doctor Strange with the colorfully Lovecraftian art of Chris Bachalo.While Doctor Strange hasn’t blown me away like I hoped it would, I have been happy with just how weird Aaron and Bachalo let the comic get, taking the magic of the Marvel universe in recently unexplored directions. More than anything, Doctor Strange is a beautiful glimpse of where a post-origins MCU Doctor Strange can go, mystical battleaxe and Tardis-like Sanctum Sanctorum on full display at all times.Creators: Joe Kelly, Ed McGuinnessFirst Issue Published: January 6, 2016Continuity Connections?:Reasonably self-contained, but makes reference to recent events from Uncanny Avengers #1. Additionally, you’ll want to be familiar with current issues of Amazing Spider-Man and Deadpool.Collected: Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol.1: Isn’t it BromanticJoe Kelly and Ed McGuiness produced one of my favorite Deadpool runs of all time in the late 90’s, and the two haven’t lost a step with the comical Spider-Man team-up book. For my money, it’s the best Deadpool book on the stands in a 2016 crowded with Deadpool.Creators: Kate Leth, Brittney L. WilliamsFirst Issue Published: December 23, 2015Continuity Connections?: Everything you need is contained in the story.Collected: Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat! Vol. 1: Hooked On A FelineWonderfully positive, upbeat all-ages from a writer with unimpeachable credentials (I heard her name a few times on Welcome to Nightvale!). Patsy Walker definitely skews younger, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say the book is purely for kids by any measure. If anything, I weigh Patsy Walker higher simply because true all ages comics are so difficult to come by from either Big 2 comic book publisher. Creators: Jeff Lemire, Andrea SorrentinoFirst Issue Published: January 27, 2016Continuity Connections?: Previously outside Marvel Earth-616 continuity, but you’ll want to read Mark Millar and Steve McNiven’s original Old Man Logan, as well as the Secret Wars tie-in.Collected: Wolverine: Old Man Logan Vol. 1: BerzerkerIf you read the Old Man Logan Secret Wars tie-in, you already know that Andrea Sorrentino’s art is going to carry an Old Man Logan ongoing to new heights. Couple that with the perpetually inventive Jeff Lemire, and this alternate reality curiosity suddenly finds life as a suitable Wolverine replacement in the Marvel Universe.Creators: Dennis Hopeless, Javier RodriguezFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: May not make a lick of sense if you haven’t read Hopeless’ run on Spider-Woman leading up to this as part of Marvel Now reading order.Collected: Spider-Woman: Shifting Gears Vol. 1: Baby TalkJavier Rodriguez’s art sends Spider-Woman soaring past all expectations. This is a gorgeous book, with a concept (pregnant, single-mom heroine) I’ve not seen in a Marvel book before. Creators: Tom Taylor, David LopezFirst Issue Published: November 11, 2015Continuity Connections?: It will certainly help to have read the Death of Wolverine event.Collected: All-New Wolverine Vol.1: The Four SistersTom Taylor’s work on Injustice for DC proved that even mired in the darkest timeline, Taylor had the awareness and presence to pace HIS version of Batman v Superman with a laugh-out-loud funny Harley Quinn and Green Arrow interlude.Taylor brings the same blend of focus to All-New Wolverine, mixing the violence and adrenaline of X-23 with a surprisingly charming newfound family life. Any replacement of a beloved character can easily fall flat, but All-New Wolverine has been a success through and through.Creators: Jason Latour, Robbi RodriguezFirst Issue Published: October 14, 2015Continuity Connections?: Spider-Gwen’s origins come out of Marvel’s Spider-Verse, but otherwise if you know the core history of Spider-Man, you’re basically ready to roll.Collected: Spider-Gwen Vol.1: Greater PowerAdmittedly, Spider-Gwen stands a leg above much of its competition purely based on concept. It’s a brilliant alternate reality, and Robbi Rodriguez’s art looks unlike anything else in the Marvel Universe.It’s the little things that set Spider-Gwen apart, though, like its commitment to the punk rock of the Mary Janes, or its alternate timeline inversions of Marvel staples like Matt Murdock or Ben Grimm.Creators: Jeff Lemire, Greg SmallwoodFirst Issue Published: April 13, 2016Continuity Connections?: Frequent references to the history of Moon Knight as a character, but otherwise, you can easily pick this up and read without context in the Marvel Universe at large.Collected: Moon Knight Vol. 1: LunaticMoon Knight is instantly captivating, stylistically unique, and constantly challenging your sense of reality and what’s safe. Topping the Marvel Now Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey Moon Knight six issue opening arc was going to be no small feat, but Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood are attempting to do so with much larger aims. Where Ellis and Shalvey composed glorious punk rock anthems, Lemire and Smallwood strive for the long game, with a labyrinthine insane asylum that quests towards the center of the true Moon Knight – whoever that may be.Creators: Warren Ellis, Gerardo ZaffinoFirst Issue Published: October 21, 2015Continuity Connections?: Definitely helps to have read Infinity and Inhumanity to see how we got here.Collected: Karnak Vol. 1: The Flaw in All ThingsNot to typecast, but aligning comics legend Warren Ellis with the new crankiest character in the entire Marvel Universe was an absolute stroke of genius.Karnak could easily be an investigative science-spy mystery outside the Marvel Universe, except it includes SHIELD hellicarriers and the best Phil Coulson and Simmons appearances in all of Marvel Comics. Karnak has made some great appearances throughout 2016, including the Ulysses infinite comic as part of Civil War 2, but the Ellis and Zaffino (and now Roland Boschi) ongoing is well worth a read.Creators: Chelsea Cain, Kate NiemczykFirst Issue Published: March 09, 2016Continuity Connections?: Light, if any.Collected: Mockingbird Vol. 1: I Can ExplainMockingbird comes storming out of the gates with one of the most interesting first issues in Marvel Comics of 2016, quickly proclaiming that Chelsea Cain and Kate Niemczyk aren’t content with standard by-the-numbers fare for Bobbi Morse.Creators: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian StelfreezeFirst Issue Published: April 6, 2016Continuity Connections?: Very much follows in the wake of Avengers vs. X-Men, and Jonathan Hickman’s time on New Avengers building up to Secret Wars.Collected: Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet Book 1Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze’s Black Panther dives headfirst into Wakandan politics and it’s hard not to see immediate and prescient parallels to real-world government and society. This is the most heavily absorbed into Wakanda a comic has been since the wonderful Panther’s Rage by Don McGregor, and it’s off to a promising and hopefully lengthy run.Creators: Ryan North, Erica HendersonFirst Issue Published: October 28, 2015Continuity Connections?: I’d recommend starting with the first volume of Unbeatable Squirrel Girl during Marvel Now, as that will explain all the supporting characters and tone of the series.Collected: The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol. 3: Squirrel, You Really Got Me NowIt’s probably safe to say that if you don’t like The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, you REALLY don’t like the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. No Marvel comic has quite mirrored pure unfiltered McSweeney’s humor like Ryan North and Erica Henderson’s Squirrel Girl. It’s fun, it’s positive, it’s upbeat, and it’s exactly that way ALL THE TIME!!!Lost in some of the silliness, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is breaking comic book storytelling conventions like they ever even mattered, from self-referential author insertion in the gutters of every page (#I’mNotScottMcCloud) to a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure issue that is likely my favorite single issue of any comic book in 2016.Creators: Tom King, Gabriel Hernandez WaltaFirst Issue Published: November 4, 2015Continuity Connections?: One of the best “just jump in read” Marvel comics since Hawkeye. Part of what makes Vision so great for comic book fans is the series is not particularly reliant on ongoing Marvel continuity. There are brief references to All-New All-Different Avengers, and definitely plenty of callbacks to the long history of Vision in the Marvel Universe. If you don’t have an encyclopedic knowledge of Vision’s history with the Avengers, and can’t necessarily list the 37 times the Vision saved the planet, you can still read Vision and enjoy it.Collected: Vision Vol. 1: Little Worse Than A ManVision isn’t my number one favorite Marvel comic of 2016, but only barely. That said, Vision is the Marvel Comic I’d be most likely to hand to a new comic book reader, or a friend who might otherwise assume a lower level of intellect from the medium. Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta have crafted a stunningly cohesive treatise on trying to achieve normalcy in suburban America, even when you’re a family of Visions and were perhaps doomed from the start.Vision is not at all what you’d expect from a comic book staring everyone’s favorite Android Avenger, and Marvel is far better for it.Creators: Al Ewing, Kenneth RocafortFirst Issue Published: November 11, 2015Continuity Connections?: Ultimates is one of the rare Marvel comics that actually explains some of the Secret Wars fallout, making it pretty heavily integrated into ongoing Marvel continuity. If that wasn’t enough, Ultimates dives head first into Civil War 2 tie-ins mid-year 2016. Not a book you easily read removed from the Marvel Universe at large.Collected: Ultimates: Omniversal Vol. 1: Start With the ImpossibleMarvel’s relaunched Ultimates, expanding on the legacy of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch’s Ultimate Universe linchpin, is simultaneously the best team book, best post Secret Wars book, and best cosmic book in the Marvel universe.The team of Blue Marvel, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, America Chavez, and Monica Rambeau take on the proactive, transparent opposite of Marvel’s Illuminati, and aim no lower in their first arc than solving Galactus. It’s glorious Marvel space science, and even through the potential tedium of Civil War 2 tie-ins, Kenneth Rocafort’s untouchable page-breaking layouts continue to bring plenty of cosmic, including Thanos unlike we’ve ever seen him.Simply put, if you liked Secret Wars, Abnett & Lanning Marvel Cosmic, and Jim “Cosmic King” Starlin comics, Ultimates will be the most refreshing Marvel comic you read in 2016. There you have it – the best 20 Marvel comics of 2016.

      "Tyler says January 19, 2017 at 8:55 pmI think the only other book I’d put on the list would be Bunn’s Uncanny. The character callbacks, developments, and tone of the book blew me away. It’s biggest downfall is Land’s art, which can pretty much ruin a book, but Bunn’s storytelling in Uncanny has proved to be some of the best X-Men content in the last few years.\n",

      "screenrant.com10 Best DC Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerDC Comics has a vast pantheon of iconic superheroes, and these are the top 10 voted characters at Ranker.Being one of the big two comic book publishers, DC Comics has established a vast and varied pantheon of superheroes over the decades. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman have long since been their flagship heroes known as \"The Trinity,\" but others have made their way into the mainstream to become favorites in their own right.RELATED: 10 Best Monsters In DC Comics, RankedComic books and comic book-based media have skyrocketed in popularity in more recent years, which, in large part, helped these characters gain bigger exposure and fan bases. The voting community of Ranker compiled a list of their 10 most popular heroes made up of long-time favorites and underdog characters.DC's Shazam has gradually been gaining traction in the mainstream thanks to the Shazam! movie, where costume designers created one of the DCEU's best suits. His alter ego Billy Batson is a child, but gains the ability to turn into the superhero Shazam as a grown metahuman. The superhero is a testament to what simpler, more lighthearted characters and stories can bring to the table in a resonant way.Shazam's premise is a refreshing change of pace from the dark and gritty, giving a cheerful and interesting dynamic of a \"Superman\" that's ultimately still going through the literal growing pains of a kid. All the while he's still handling the responsibilities and level of power on a similar scale to Superman.The early goings of the Arrow TV series helped bolster Green Arrow's popularity, but he's been respectably well-known in DC's comics. Similar to Bruce Wayne, Oliver Queen is a rich philanthropist who used his identity to masquerade the Robin Hood-like persona of Green Arrow.But he grew to be a compelling character in his own right away from being an alternate Batman character. One of his most iconic comic book arcs is as a duo with Green Lantern. The premise of the story, and the background of the two superheroes' respective worldviews, made for thought-provoking social commentary.Undeservedly so, Aquaman was often on the wrong side of many jokes within superhero fanbases. The misconceptions didn't do the hero justice in making people realize how valuable he is to the Justice League.RELATED: 10 Best Friendships In DC ComicsMore modern-age comics started fixing the misunderstandings surrounding the character, telling interesting stories displaying Aquaman's true power and tackling issues like finding a sense of belonging. He's a perfect character for the latter basis, as he's someone caught between two different worlds and communities while feeling responsibility toward both.One of DC's dark-horse superheroes that deserves more recognition is Martian Manhunter. The underrated powerhouse character started getting more attention partly thanks to the excellent Justice League and Justice League Unlimited DCAU animated shows.The shape-shifting martian serves as a compassionate intergalactic crime fighter and is often depicted as the Justice League's empathetic heart and soul. In terms of live-action, the most fans have gotten was the tease in Zack Snyder's Justice League. With the potential the character has, many fans undoubtedly hope that he makes a return to add to the DCEU's diverse cast of heroes.The Hal Jordan iteration is arguably the most conventionally used version by DC Comics. He's one of the three most iconic incarnations of Green Lantern alongside Alan Scott and John Stewart. One of the narrative benefits of the Green Lantern persona is how varied different versions can be, as the Green Lantern Corp. is an intergalactic peacekeeping force filled with them.RELATED: 10 DC Comics Events, Ranked By ImportanceIt makes the possibilities endless on what kinds of characters to explore. Hal Jordan has provided some memorable stories, though, with his aforementioned ideological character study with Green Arrow as a highlight.  The perspectives the two gain make for one of DC's hallmark friendships.One of the most iconic superheroes in general, Wonder Woman earns her title as one of \"The Trinity.\" Along with Superman and Batman, the Princess of Themyscira is one of the core pillars and founding members of the Justice League. Wonder Woman's demonstrated incredible feats of power, devotion to her convictions, but also shows human compassion.The superhero is also partly responsible for breaking tired genre tropes of the \"damsel in distress,\" while bringing to life colorful, sweeping stories involving Greek mythology and the different eras of humanity. The latter of which in part told through her involvement with the Justice Society.Barry Allen is the most synonymous character to the Flash persona and is also a mainstay in the DC Universe's most important events. The Flash is often the superhero first to come into fans' minds when thinking of superspeed. He was even one of the main superhero characters responsible for DC's successful revitalization of the genre, taking it into the Silver Age of comics.The \"Fastest Man Alive\" is a great and pivotal character for exploring the multiverse concept. Undoubtedly the most noteworthy story arc of the Flash is his Flashpoint crossover that presented wide-spreading ramifications for DC's multiverse.Dick Grayson established the Dynamic Duo with Bruce Wayne's Batman and has proven to be one of the most beloved and important Bat-family characters. After falling and growing out of being a sidekick superhero, Dick stretched out and made an identity of his own in the form of Nightwing.RELATED: 10 Most Iconic Harley Quinn Panels In DC ComicsHis charismatic, kindhearted, and empathetic nature made for an excellent emotional anchor for his adoptive father and being a fan-favorite on his own merits. Bruce himself has said that Dick Grayson represents a purer form of Batman is meant to be. Fans generally seem to agree, believing that he's the one person most suitable for inheriting the Batman mantle.The Son of Krypton is one of the most famous characters that's become synonymous with the word \"superhero\" in general. Clark Kent's story as Superman is a timeless one of how good humanity can collectively be. It's also a celebration of embracing people of all walks of life, as despite being a Kryptonian, Superman represents the purest form of what it means to be human as a true \"Man of Tomorrow.\"He's the embodiment of what people should strive to be, while still being a compelling character that suffers and triumphs through his trials and flaws. Superman also completes a great friendship and dynamic with Batman in the comics, which is often the central focus in titles such as World's Finest and events like Kingdom Come.Unsurprisingly, the Dark Knight himself endures as DC's most loved superhero. Batman is second in popularity only to Marvel's Spider-Man, with the former making up some of the comic book medium's most acclaimed comics. His high benchmark of quality ranges from having some of the best rogues galleries of DC villains to gripping psychological and crime-noir stories.In his best arcs, Batman's stories represent exceptional cases of exploring the traumatized flaws of the psyche, as well as how someone can take moments of excruciating emotional pain and forge them into an indomitable force for good and redemption. That even in periods of overbearing darkness, there's always a path back. Redemption is another timeless message because it has to be if humanity is to persevere.NEXT: 10 Most Iconic Batman Comic Panels, RankedGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he now resides in Houston. He is a fan of pretty much anything involving nerd culture. Video games, comics, movies, TV, anime, manga, you name it.

But its earlier publishing years offered a diverse selection of genres to a hungry audience alongside its costumed crimebusters and at times even supplanting them. Marvel’s genre titles maintained their relevance throughout the decades before getting another big shot in the 1970s. Publisher Martin Goodman launched his comic book empire with a bang in 1939, relying on then-editor Joe Simon to hit the ground running with new troops of Super Heroes to not only capitalize on the growing trend, but to pave the way for innovations, too. Legendary artist Jack Kirby joined the Timely Comics team the next year to kick off a new decade that would be overshadowed by war, but also offer hope in the form of such dynamic and patriotic characters as Captain America.In 1942, Timely Super Heroes marched in step with another comic crowd, a growing army of funny animal humor characters. Titles like COMEDY COMICS and KRAZY KOMICS offered the antics of Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal, as well as Powerhouse Pepper and Super Rabbit. Goodman saw his profits rise throughout the dark days of World War II by watching publishing trends, and when mystery men and women began to decline in popularity by the end of the war in 1945, he added more comedic critters to the mix and bolstered their ranks with a new craze: teen humor titles.Patsy Walker, Millie the Model, Nellie the Nurse, and their ilk made their voices known as a sort-of balm to a world weary from war and ready for light-hearted adventures with beautiful boys and girls. By 1947, the teen books exploded in what can only be called a boom as Super Heroes continued to slide into decline. At this point, crime and Western comics also found a welcome niche at Timely, and series like OFFICIAL TRUE CRIME CASES COMICS and KID COLT OUTLAW took over the spotlight, joined by a new genre aimed at a somewhat older, more mature audience.Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created romance comics for another company in an attempt to capture the “true love” magazine crowd, and Martin Goodman, always on the look-out for another avenue of exploration, published his first foray into the genre with MY ROMANCE. It proved to be such a hit with readers that more such love letters followed, cementing the idea within the industry.By the end of the decade, several things occurred at Goodman’s house. As funny animals fell out of favor, he converted his remaining Super Hero books into other themes such as horror, dropped the Timely Comics brand name, and mashed his two popular genres of romance and Westerns up into hybrid titles like COWBOY ROMANCES and RANGELAND LOVE. The for-the-most-part nameless comic book company forged ahead into the 1950s, eager to expand and electrify, little knowing a storm cloud lingered on the horizon in the name of decency and family values.With the war’s paper rationing behind him, Martin Goodman steered his ship into a second decade with full steam ahead and an eye on both increased publishing and profits. The Korean War brought war comics to the front lines in 1951, and under the new moniker of Atlas Comics, Goodman brought out BATTLE, WAR COMICS, SPY FIGHTERS, and his first character-driven war title, COMBAT KELLY. In addition, he poured more resources into the creeping horror genre with such title as MYSTIC, ASTONISHING, and STRANGE TALES, and even transformed an existing Super Hero book, VENUS, into a terror tome. In 1952, Atlas offered an incredible array of series, covering war, horror, crime, Westerns, romance, sports, teen humor, science fiction, and even a nod or two to the then-passé funny animal world. By the next year, Goodman added LORNA THE JUNGLE QUEEN, SPEED CARTER SPACEMAN, and PATSY AND HER PALS into his stable, as well as experimenting with oddball one-offs like BIBLE TALES FOR YOUNG FOLK. The man never knew a genre he wouldn’t exploit.But such popularity also attracted detractors. A crusading psychiatrist named Frederic Wertham seized upon, among other things, the no-rules horror comics of the day and made a public issue out of them, going so far as to encouraging parents to turn upon the comics industry and see it as he saw it – a “seduction of the innocent” that just couldn’t continue. In 1954, after a Senate subcommittee hearing on the topic, Goodman joined with other leaders in the business to create the Comics Code Authority, a self-policing entity that took the teeth out of not only horror books, but just about every other title on the stands.The industry as it stood in 1955 looked different than its earlier existence. Comics still proliferated and in many genres, but as nicer, gentler reading material. Atlas Comics looked for other ways to earn its money, introducing books like BLACK KNIGHT, WYATT EARP, YELLOW CLAW, and SNAFU, but despite the diversity, artists and writers began to abandon the industry for safer, calmer waters. By the end of 1957, Goodman lost much of his distribution and slashed titles left and right. As the end of the decade approached, only 16 books remained of the dozens he once published, a pale shadow of a once mighty machine.The publisher left much of the day-to-day business to editor Stan Lee, who trudged ahead and watched for opportunities to use the talent he had on-hand, namely Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. New trends would arise, informing a bright new universe just over the next hill.Monsters—that’s what Stan Lee produced, and at the newly christened Marvel Comics, that’s what sold as the 1950s transitioned into the 1960s. Books like TALES OF SUSPENSE and TALES TO ASTONISH illustrated multiple invasions of Earth by armies of towering atrocities. In 1960, while other genres still sold, Lee and company pressed hard on the monstrosities allowed by the Code and created a sub-genre all its own.Then, something else happened. The Super Heroes came back to the company in 1961, and with a vengeance. Lee took the idea of the popular monsters he’d been writing about for the last few years and molded them into heroes, and in doing so breathed new blood and life into a theme that had both seen better days and had never, really gone away. The downside of blockbusters like 1961’s FANTASTIC FOUR and 1962’s AMAZING SPIDER-MAN lurked in the fact that as the costumed crimefighters ascended once again, the other genres not only took a backseat, but more accurately crawled into the trunk. As the decade exploded with four-color fantasies, older titles were converted into Super Hero series and themes of horror, science fiction, and the like became submerged in the new trend. Where once they enjoyed their own titles, they now shored up the heroes with jumping-off points and launch pads.By the end of the 1960s and the dawn of the 1970s, Marvel attempted to hang onto its diversity with new publications like MAD ABOUT MILLIE, CHILI, TOWER OF SHADOWS, and MY LOVE, but the writing on the wall spoke of Super Heroes. As time marched along, what was once Timely and Atlas’s bread and butter became Marvel Comics’ dim past, not its shining future.Perhaps flush with its success with Super Heroes in the 1960s, the company tried to look for opportunities to branch out over the 1970s. Black and white magazine-sized books seemed to be just the ticket, and unhampered by the Comics Code and aiming at older audiences, Marvel published SAVAGE TALES #1 in 1971, which introduced the macabre Man-Thing and other dark fancies. A significant alteration to the Code in 1972 allowed for horror creatures again, and Marvel opened up the vaults to unleash such terror titans as Werewolf by Night, Dracula, Ghost Rider, the Frankenstein Monster, and even the Son of Satan himself.Fads of the 1970s translated into new series for the company, like spotlighting martial arts in books such as DEADLY HANDS OF KUNG FU and with characters called Shang-Chi and Iron Fist. Science fiction made a comeback in the form of Killraven, who fought the War of the Worlds in AMAZING ADVENTURES in 1973, and the cyborg Deathlok in ASTONISHING TALES in 1974. Even offbeat ideas like COMIX BOOK, an “underground”-style magazine, and funny animals with a twist, like HOWARD THE DUCK, gained a small foothold in the experimental ‘70s.It seemed like a brave new world, but by the decade’s midpoint, the Super Heroes asserted themselves again, and all the other genres were quietly folded into the costumed characters’ universe. Media tie-ins like STAR WARS, TARZAN, and JOHN CARTER WARLORD OF MARS in 1977 were the last hurrah of diversity, and by 1980, Marvel was poised to take the crown for most-popular Super Hero publisher.Super Heroes still dominate to this day, though inquiring minds will always find the echoes of comics history by simply looking back and marveling at the long and winding road of the House of Ideas’ path.

      "The ten best Marvel Comics stories from the House of IdeasNewsarama's list of the best Marvel Comics stories will have a new addition if the publisher has anything to say about it.Marvel has been setting up Judgment Day as its next big event story, which will apparently put the X-Men and Eternals in a standoff with the Avengers caught in the middle - which sounds like the recipe for a knockdown-dragout battle for the ages.And Marvel has plenty of experience with telling epic tales that stand the test of time - with stories like Civil War and Infinity Gauntlet working their way into the public consciousness as classic stories above and beyond the comic book medium.But what are the best Marvel Comics stories ever? Though that may seem like a daunting question, Newsarama has prepared a list of the best Marvel Comics stories of all time!The original X-Men story 'Days of Future Past ' was simply two issues of the main ongoing series, Uncanny X-Men #141 and #142 (Take that, 200+ issue events of today!) In a dystopian future, mutants have been rounded up into concentration camps; that is, the ones who haven't been slaughtered. Adult Kitty Pryde's consciousness travels back in time to stop the assassination of a prominent government figure (in the story, Senator Robert Kelly) by Mystique and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.While she succeeds, and the world is avoided (at least in one timeline), there are some lasting effects. Rachel Summers, a prominent character in today's X-Men titles, came from that alternate future. So did the hyper-advanced Nimrod Sentinel, which has been a key antagonist in the current X-Men era.The storyline was adapted into the 2014 feature film, one of the most highly-regarded of the Fox X-Men franchise. Buy: AmazonIn 2006, Marvel Comics decided they were going to ignite the cosmic corner of the Marvel Universe. Writer Keith Giffen was tapped to conceive a limited series and a set of tie-ins titled Annihilation, intended to establish characters new and old as major players in the Marvel universe. The story, told entirely apart from the mainstream Marvel Universe without the input of heroes like the Avengers and X-Men, letting the more obscure cosmic heroes take the spotlight - eventually leading to the formation of a new version of the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became the basis for the popular MCU version of the team.Indeed, the Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise literally would not have come to pass without Annihilation having redefined Star-Lord, Groot, and Rocket, and bringing that group of heroes together in the first place.Buy: AmazonLong before anyone could even conceive of carving out a whole corner of the Marvel Universe devoted to cosmic threats, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created what may still be considered the ultimate cosmic threat: Galactus.First appearing in Fantastic Four #48-50, the godlike being from beyond the stars came careening into the solar system and the lives of Marvel's First Family, widening the entire scope of the Marvel Universe in the process.Both the Silver Surfer and The Watcher also made their debuts in 'The Coming of Galactus,' with the latter becoming a burgeoning figure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the recent What If...? animated Disney Plus series.Buy: AmazonThere was a time when Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli could basically do no wrong, and 1986-1987 was simply a magical period for the pair, who essentially reinvented major street-level vigilante heroes for both Marvel and DC in the span of about a year and a half - including, most importantly for this list, Marvel's Daredevil.The pair's arc together on Daredevil #227-231 (with some ancillary work in #232 and #233) has it all: romance, intrigue, religion, and of course tons of action. There’s The Kingpin, Ben Urich, Nuke, and Captain America. This story basically tears Daredevil down to virtually nothing and lets him emerge, 'Born Again,' into a better, stronger hero than ever before.Marvel is even invoking 'Born Again' as a reference point for its upcoming Punisher relaunch, which promises big changes for Frank Castle.Buy: AmazonNo, not 2015-16's Secret Wars - but the original!Back in 1984, Marvel Comics and toy makers Mattel had the big idea to team up for a joint toyline and accompanying comic book series featuring all the biggest heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe in one story, resulting in Secret Wars, the first major Marvel crossover event.Secret Wars set the mold for later Marvel events with its own 12-issue limited series, as well as tie-in stories told through ten other comics. Secret Wars pitted a veritable who's-who of Marvel heroes and villains against each other, with the results being an occasionally goofy but still exciting and even defining story with ramifications that spiraled out across the entire Marvel Universe.Spider-Man's black Symbiote suit (that was really Venom), She-Hulk on the Fantastic Four, the second Spider-Woman Julia Carpenter - they all got their start in Secret Wars, along with even more storylines and character changes that continued to play out in a much less well-received sequel just a few years later.Buy: AmazonIn the late '90s, Marvel proclaimed they were going to cancel the entire X-Men line, then at the height of its immense popularity, and replace it with a whole new slate of titles - and lo they did, reimagining the entire X-line in an alternate reality with a vastly different status quo.The result was four months of alternate-reality comic books titled 'Age of Apocalypse,' which turned the entire X-Men franchise on its head with new roles and new relationships for almost all the line's characters. Set in a timeline where Charles Xavier died before founding the X-Men and Apocalypse is the unquestioned ruler of the world, 'Age of Apocalypse' presented readers with wildly different takes on Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Wolverine, Magneto, Rogue, and many, many more.Though an event as massive as 'Age of Apocalypse' is never without its hiccups, the story took fans by storm - with some of the new versions of the characters even making it into the mainstream Marvel Universe after the story concluded and the classic X-Men timeline was restored.Buy: AmazonThis story beat 'Age of Apocalypse' by one vote in our reader poll. One of the newest stories on our list, Marvel's Civil War asked the question, 'Whose side are you on?'Civil War starts with a bang (so sorry) as the New Warriors, while trying to subdue a B-list villain, are involved in a resulting explosion that kills 600 people (including many children and the New Warriors themselves) at a Stamford, Connecticut elementary school. As a result, the US government fast-tracks legislation called the Superhuman Registration Act, requiring anyone with powers and abilities beyond that of a mortal person to register with the government - thereby revealing their identity, with the caveat that they must train with government-approved heroes if they want to keep using their powers.(The concept of the SHRA was somewhat adapted into the MCU as the Sokovia Accords).Ultimately, this leads to Iron Man leading the pro-registration side and Captain America leading the anti-registration folks, with the two sides going all-out in a superhero civil war - a war with real consequences with major deaths.Tony Stark becomes Director of SHIELD, while Captain America is assassinated, leading to a much deeper, longer-term rift between many of Marvel's heroes.Marvel loved this story so much it was adapted to film in the blockbuster Captain America: Civil War and led to a comic book sequel, Civil War II. Buy: AmazonOutside of the death of Uncle Ben, it's quite possible that Amazing Spider-Man #121-122 are the most important issues in the entire life of Peter Parker. The story said it right there in the title. They spoiled the outcome. They told the truth. This would be 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died.'Norman Osborn, back as the Green Goblin, takes Gwen Stacy - Pete's girlfriend at the time - and throws her off a bridge. Just when it looks like Spider-Man successfully saves her, his webbing catches her ankle ... but the sudden stop snaps her neck.Gwen's death was utterly tragic, and a true surprise - devastating Peter Parker (and many readers) like almost nothing before or since. It's heartbreaking and shocking, and in 1973, it was something that made people look at comic books, especially superhero comic books, in a very different way.Buy: Amazon'The Dark Phoenix Saga ,' to this day, is the story that all other X-Men stories are held up to. The first seeds of the tale began way back in 1976 when Jean Grey first came into contact with the Phoenix Force in X-Men #101-108. Then the 'Dark' part hit four years later in #129-138, as Jean comes under the influence of the Hellfire Club.A masterpiece of a story by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, this epic holds some truly marquee moments for the team both as a whole and as individual members. Cyclops battles Mastermind on the psychic plane. Wolverine takes on a seemingly endless stream of Hellfire Club soldiers. Oh, and Jean Grey, as the Dark Phoenix, goes berzerk, eats a sun (killing an orbiting planet's entire population), and goes on trial for genocide. When Jean manages to gain control of herself for one short moment, she sacrifices herself to end the Dark Phoenix, dying in Cyclops' arms.Over the course of the next few years (and several retcons), some of the pivotal moments would later be backtracked to bring back Jean and the Phoenix Force, but none of it has managed to cheapen or take away from the original classic.Buy: AmazonAt this point, if you don't know about Infinity Gauntlet - the seminal Marvel Comics event that took the lead on our poll of the best Marvel stories by a wide margin - you simply haven't been paying attention.Bringing together basically all of Marvel's heroes at the time to take on the existential threat of Thanos the Mad Titan and his quest for the Infinity Stones, which hold the power to remake reality itself, Infinity Gauntlet tells the story of what happens when the heroes actually fail - a somewhat unprecedented story at the time.Of course, the heroes manage to overcome their defeat and win the day, restoring the universal destruction caused by Thanos, but not before the entire landscape of the Marvel Universe is changed by the experience - and not entirely for the better.Infinity Gauntlet has it all - an unbeatable foe, an incredible creative team in Jim Starlin, George Perez, and Ron Lim, and a conglomeration of the world's greatest heroes involved in cosmic action with the highest stakes possible.Even if you haven't read Infinity Gauntlet (and you should!), you probably know some of the story's broad strokes from its two-part MCU adaptation as Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.Buy: AmazonLove comics but don't know where to start?

      "Top 100 NBA Players of 2019The Crossover is proud to offer our list of the Top 100 NBA players of 2019, an exhaustive exercise that seeks to define who will be the league's best players in the 2018-19 season.Given the wide variety of candidates involved and the deep analytical resources available, no single, definitive criterion was used to form this list. Instead, rankings were assigned based on a fluid combination of subjective assessment and objective data. This list is an attempt to evaluate each player in a vacuum, independent of his current team context as much as possible. A player's prospects beyond the 2018-19 season did not play a part in the ranking process.Injuries and injury risks are an inevitable component of this judgment. Past performance (postseason included) weighed heavily in our assessment, with a skew toward the recent. First-year players were not included. A predictive element also came into play with the anticipated improvement of certain younger players, as well as the possible decline of aging veterans. Salary was not taken into consideration. Otherwise, players were ordered based on their complete games. You can read more here on the limitations of this kind of ranking. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year, click here.Please feel free to look back to SI.com’s Top 100 Players of 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. A special thanks, as always, to those resources that make researching a list like this possible: Basketball-Reference, NBA.com, ESPN.com, Cleaning the Glass, and Synergy Sports.Ball (10.2 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 7.2 APG) was the league’s easiest target last season: He faced significant pressure as the No. 2 pick, he faced extra scrutiny on a high-profile franchise that had one eye on LeBron James, he faced derision for his unsightly jumper and fading confidence, and he faced second-hand disdain thanks to the ramblings of his infamous father and his immature brother. “Baptism by Fire” would be an appropriate name for a documentary about his first season, which began with Patrick Beverley eating him for dinner and ended with knee problems that ultimately required summer surgery.At his best, the 20-year-old Ball plays a beautiful weirdo brand of hoops that would merit a full chapter if “Free Darko” ever released a sequel. His passing and vision—hailed as elite by pre-draft analysts—lived up to the hype. He proved to be a capable pace-setter and a strong rebounder for his position. Most impressively, he was a plus defender right out of the gate thanks to his good size and instincts. On paper, Ball’s role in James’s new cast is intriguing. A successful blueprint would utilize him as a secondary passer and off-ball cutter, rather than as a full-time lead guard launching misguided threes in volume. Although Ball is hardly a textbook modern backcourt prospect, the dawn of “LeBronzo” promises to carry his distinctive game to new heights. — BGJust because the Lakers had no use for Lopez (13.0 PPG, 4.0 RPG) doesn’t mean the same is true for other teams. It’s not hard to find room for a seven-footer who can score inside and out, and most important: one who doesn’t need much preamble to set up his scoring opportunities. Posting up Lopez is an option, but far from the only one. You could set him up for rolls to the rim or rely on his cuts to complement other offense. Or, if you prefer, you can station him outside to open up the lane. Lopez isn’t a lights-out three-point shooter, though last season he converted the same percentage of his threes (34.5%) as Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, and Blake Griffin—all bigs with some light stretch to their games.All told, Lopez still scored 20 points per 36 minutes for a team that had no incentive to play him or rely on him in any way. That will be different in Milwaukee, as it would be on any number of teams looking to actually win games this season. Lopez’s defense is clearly imperfect, though he at least has the benefit of sheer size; it’s hard to clear the ball over a center with that kind of reach, even if he runs into trouble defending in space. — RMAge may have restricted how and when Gasol can be of help, but coaches tend to find a place for those who understand the symphony of the game. Gasol (10.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 3.1 APG) is more than the collection of his skills and liabilities; his enduring value comes in knowing what opportunities might materialize, and having the presence of mind to assist in their creation. Any offense that moves would benefit from dropping Gasol in the middle of it all, where he presents a scoring threat even as he connects the dots for his teammates.The cost comes in mobility—both in a literal sense and a tactical one. On his best days, the 38-year-old Gasol navigates the floor at a brisk shuffle. Switching isn’t an option. Longer rotations can be a challenge. San Antonio managed a top-five defense in spite of this, but Gasol would present much greater problems for many lesser teams. His, like many in this range, is a borderline case. What value Gasol still has depends on how effectively a team manages the narrowing limits of his game. — RMStan Van Gundy bet the house on Jackson (14.6 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 5.3 APG) and lost. In 2015, the longtime coach targeted the stubborn, capable point guard as the centerpiece of a win-now spending spree aimed at fast-tracking the Pistons back to the postseason. The plan worked momentarily, as Jackson turned in a career year en route to the 2016 playoffs. But Jackson’s spotty health plunged Detroit back into the lottery in 2017 and 2018, and Van Gundy was fired in May. The final stats on the Jackson/Van Gundy marriage: $80 million, one playoff trip, zero playoff wins, two season-altering injuries, numerous post-game rants, and one desperate Blake Griffin trade that will likely clog Detroit’s books for years to come.While Jackson, 28, is a bit of a forgotten man at this point, it’s worth noting that Detroit played at a 49-win place last season with him in the lineup. To piece his reputation back together, Jackson will need to prove that he can still get to the rim consistently, shoot the three far better than he did in 2017-18, and stay healthy for a full season. With Griffin and Andre Drummond now capable of handling some of the playmaking load, Detroit can make the playoffs without Jackson turning back the clock to his 2016 form. Expecting Jackson to be a franchise point guard was always asking too much, but he has enough talent and experience to be recast effectively in a smaller role if he’s willing. — BGTo understand how Nowitzki clings to this list past his 40th birthday, one need only watch how defenses regard him. Every screen he sets has an adhesive effect; those defenders involved know that their first priority is to slow the progress of the ball handler, but to do so requires that they reluctantly peel away from Nowitzki (12.0 PPG, 5.7 RPG). There is more than reputation at work. Just last season, Nowitzki rated as one of the better spot-up shooters in the league, per Synergy Sports—more efficient, shot for shot, than even Klay Thompson and J.J. Redick. Opponents won’t dare leave Dirk because they know just how punishing his open looks can be.Nearly everything else in Nowitzki’s game has faded with time. One can practically hear his creaking joints when he tries to back down some younger, springier center, and there is no disguising his slow-motion coverage of the pick-and-roll. It speaks volumes, however, that a walking—err, lumbering?—target like Nowitzki still works out to be a helpful contributor in so many lineups. There is something to be said for standard bearing and institutional knowledge, but even more when those things come from a low-turnover, sweet-shooting big who is more than willing to accept a lesser role. Dirk’s value to an organization has aged more gracefully than his footspeed. — RMLet’s credit Carroll (13.5 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 2.0 APG) with genuine nobility. Remember, it wasn’t so long ago that the 32-year-old forward was leaving Toronto as a huge disappointment due to an exorbitant four-year, $60 million contract, a debilitating knee injury and a pair of meek postseasons. After he was salary-dumped to the dead-end Nets, Carroll could have counted his money and jogged through a losing campaign. Instead, he responded to the trying circumstances with purposeful 3-and-D play. In addition to posting career-highs in points, rebounds and assists, Carroll regained his footing on the defensive end, ranking No. 64 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus.With better health, Carroll has largely returned to the form he displayed for the 2015 Hawks. On offense, he subsists on catch-and-shoot threes and cuts to the basket. On defense, he rotates through multiple perimeter positions and rates well on hustle stats like deflections and recovered loose balls thanks to his high-activity style. If Carroll can keep things rolling to open 2018-19, he should generate healthy interest from playoff teams at the trade deadline or during buyout season. — BGIt’s no exaggeration to say that VanVleet (8.6 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 3.2 APG) was an impact stats god last year. The 24-year-old Raptors guard, who finished third in 2018 Sixth Man of the Year voting, was off the charts in virtually every lineup configuration. When he played with his fellow young reserves, who led the NBA among bench groups in net rating, Toronto was +17.1. When he joined a veteran-heavy and starters-dominated group as a floor-spacing third guard, Toronto was +24.9. Remarkably, VanVleet ranked No. 28 in the NBA in Real Plus-Minus and in the top 100 by both Win Shares and WARP. All this for an undersized, undrafted player who has yet to record a single start in two seasons.The magnitude of VanVleet’s success in a limited role naturally raises some questions. How well would his contributions hold up if he was forced to play more than 20 minutes a night? How would he fare if he was asked to lead a less-talented bench group? How well would his game translate to the playoffs? The early returns on that last question were not pretty. As he worked back from an untimely shoulder injury, VanVleet couldn’t recapture his dependable three-point stroke and wasn’t about to single-handedly solve Toronto’s annual problems with composure and defense. The Raptors’ ugly ending poured some cold water on their much-hyped bench play, but it didn’t erase VanVleet’s substantial progress. The sweep against Cleveland didn’t kill VanVleet’s earning power either, as he cashed in with a well-deserved two-year, $18 million contract in July. — BGOlynyk shoots just well enough from the perimeter to earn a close-out, which is exactly the point. The shot itself is a setup; helpful as it is that Olynyk can take and make threes, his funky, off-kilter drives are the true underpinning of his game.Each of his forays into traffic is an improbable enterprise. Olynyk (11.5 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.7 APG) is about as far from the driving prototype as NBA players come; he isn’t especially quick, or explosive, or creative with the ball. His running form most closely resembles that of a giraffe. Yet when given room to navigate, Olynyk has a knack for sliding between defenders, coursing into the paint for layups of all kinds. Miami played its best basketball last season with Olynyk on the floor, in large part because those ball skills matter. When a big can create space and capitalize when called upon, they allow more possessions to follow through to their natural conclusion. — RMThinking for too long about Fournier (17.8 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 2.9 APG) in Orlando can lead to intense feelings of sympathy and hopelessness. The 25-year-old guard is a proven shooter and cheeky ball-handler who is stuck in a constant struggle to score enough points to offset his porous defense, all while playing for an organization that doesn’t offer much in the way of supporting talent or structure. His 2017-18 campaign marked a career year in scoring and efficiency, but it ended prematurely due to injury and didn’t improve the Magic’s playoff prospects in the slightest. If a relatively anonymous Frenchman goes for 22 in a loss in front of a listless crowd, does he make a sound?Although Fournier appears to be a lost cause on defense due to his lack of physicality and questionable will, he’s filled out his offensive repertoire nicely. After four years with the Magic, he’s a trustworthy catch-and-shoot option from the wing, he understands how to relocate into space to find a quality look, he’s shifty coming around screens and splitting defenders, and he’s developed some off-legged floaters and runners to catch bigs by surprise. Although his sizeable contract makes it difficult to construct viable trade scenarios, it’s easy to envision him thriving in an Eric Gordon-like role for a playoff team that needs instant offense off the bench. As is, the Magic are asking too much of him offensively and he’s not asking enough from himself defensively. — BGBazemore (12.9 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.5 APG) is the NBA’s anti-Forrest Gump: He has an uncanny knack for always just missing out on the action. The 29-year-old guard, who went undrafted in 2012, arrived on the scene with the Warriors just before Stephen Curry and Co. rocketed to dynasty mode. He then had a brief cup of coffee with the Lakers in 2014, a period of deep irrelevance after the ill-fated Dwight Howard experiment but before Kobe Bryant’s farewell tour. From there he landed in Atlanta, where he played a bit role on a team that made the 2015 East finals before finally breaking out in a starting role just as the team’s core was disbanded.Thanks to the four-year, $70 million contract he inked during the 2016 cap spike, Bazemore has gone from toiling in the G-League to becoming the highest-paid player on one of the league’s worst rosters in less than five years. Although he’s clearly overpaid and unequipped to be a playoff team’s best, second-best or third-best player, Bazemore is a solid 3-and-D wing with good size and motor. In an ideal world, he would be cast as a fifth option in a contender’s starting lineup and asked to space the court, pick his spots to attack off the dribble, and bring energy on the defensive end. If Trae Young grows quickly into stardom, Bazemore will be a handy complementary piece. If not, he’ll continue to be grist for the trade rumor mill. — BGThe closest Orlando came to competence last season was in Vucevic’s time on the floor. So continued a four-year run of inflated usage, in which the seven-footer was overstretched and miscast as a primary offensive option. No playoff team would use Vucevic (16.5 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 3.4 APG) in this way, but the Magic—even after five straight years in the lottery—are short on viable alternatives. Vucevic’s steady, accessible scoring is welcome on a team with so many stalled possessions.Extricating Vucevic’s broader value from those circumstances is challenging, though one can safely assume he would be better served by doing less. Just because Vucevic can score a bit from everywhere (including beyond the arc, in a recent development) doesn’t mean he should try to quite so often; for Vucevic to attempt about as many shots per minute as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis Antetokounmpo is a monumental stretch. Were he on a remotely functional team with amenities like floor spacing and playmaking, Vucevic could slot into a healthier role as a supporting scorer and dependable rebounder. — RMMurray (8.1 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.9 APG) is the NBA equivalent of a writing whiz who aces the verbal section of the SAT with ease but gives up and guesses “C” on all the math questions. By virtually every defensive metric, the second-year guard is phenomenal. At 21, he earned All-Defensive Second Team honors by placing in the top 10 in Defensive Real Plus-Minus, Defensive Rating, and steal percentage while playing for the NBA’s fourth-ranked defense. Murray is a prototypical backcourt stopper in both physique and psychology: long, quick, aware, irritating, diligent, and fully committed to the glass.By virtually every offensive metric, though, Murray is a borderline mess. He’s been an incompetent and unwilling shooter at the NBA level, and he is regularly neglected and dared to shoot. Unlike many guards who struggle from beyond the arc, he hasn’t yet perfected a compensatory weapon like a step-in mid-range jumper or an in-between floater. While Murray is generally unselfish and a willing passer, he’s not adept enough in the two-man game to function as a lead distributor. In sum, the Spurs’ offense was generally better when the ball was in someone else’s hands. With Kawhi Leonard, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Kyle Anderson all departing this summer, the man dubbed “Baby Boy” as a Seattle-area prep star must grow up in a hurry. — BG“Slo Mo” might not be the best nickname in pro sports, but it’s certainly the most accurate. Anderson (7.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 2.7 APG) is deliberate in virtually everything he does, whether it’s pushing the ball in transition, executing a frame-by-frame Eurostep, or acclimating to life in the NBA. Although it took four seasons and Kawhi Leonard’s extended absence for Anderson to break through as a full-time starter, he acquitted himself very nicely once he got there. The 24-year-old forward posted career-highs across the board last season, and his efficient play and all-around contributions landed him in the top 75 by Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP. Seeking a value play to make up for the Chandler Parsons debacle, Memphis poached Anderson with a four-year, $37 million contract in July.Anderson’s biggest weakness—poor outside shooting—is a critical one, but he has developed workarounds: He has a strong understanding of team spacing, he stays active off the ball, he moves hard into passes to launch unexpected attacks on the paint, he sprays drive-and-kick passes to all corners and he has a quirky and well-honed array of turnarounds, floaters and runners. San Antonio’s recent actions suggest, however, that they perceived a hard ceiling to his utility given his floor-cramping nature and limited raw athleticism. The Spurs sharply cut his minutes when facing the Warriors in the playoffs, and then decided not to match the Grizzlies’ offer even though they had a major hole on the wing. For Anderson, Memphis represents a fresh start, a larger role, and a chance to prove that his subtle and nuanced style can translate outside San Antonio’s structured environment. — BGSteve Kerr delivered a fitting postscript to Golden State’s grueling seven-game triumph over Houston in the West finals: “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.” That assessment spoke to the importance of the Warriors’ prized sixth man, but also to the precarious position the defending champs face when he’s not on the court. Indeed, the 34-year-old Iguodala (6 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.3 APG) has arguably become the biggest potential pothole on the road to a fourth title in five years. Last season, he continued to show clear signs of aging by posting career-lows in minutes and points, missing 18 regular-season games and six crucial playoff games, and failing to display must trust in his three-point shot.Nevertheless, the Warriors remain virtually unbeatable when their full “Hamptons 5” lineup is assembled, going 19-3 combined in the last two postseasons. During the 2018 playoffs, they posted a 123.7 offensive rating and a staggering +24.8 net rating, as Iguodala’s excellent feel, commitment to the pass, precise defense, and opportunistic shot-making continued to make him an ideal fifth option. While there’s no question that Iguodala’s reputation and body would suffer if he played for a weaker team, aspiring contenders like Houston, Boston and Philadelphia would all kill to have a second-unit wing with his intelligence, experience and unselfish approach. — BGFor a player as active as Johnson (10.8 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 3.8 APG), a sports hernia—the injury he nursed through much of last season—can prove quite taxing. So much of Johnson’s game is anchored in how he moves; it’s his ability to change speeds and directions that makes him so dynamic on offense, and it’s the ease with which he slides laterally that brings value to a defense. If Johnson’s all-around play seemed a bit flat last season, that’s because it was—down to his every step.Offseason surgery hints at a return to form. Competing in the modern NBA all but demands a player like Johnson—a big who can capably switch, handle, pass, and shoot. Some of those skills are less reliable than others in Johnson’s case, though their intersection alone makes him valuable. You live with his wilder swings because of all that his versatility unlocks. The means to beat the trap, to trigger the break, to control matchups, and to move a guard off the ball are all there for Johnson, provided he’s healthy and focused. — RMFormer Rockets wing Shane Battier was famously dubbed the “No-Stats All-Star” for his vital defense and glue-guy game; Tucker (6.1 PPG, 5.6 RPG) is his pudgier heir apparent in Houston. By traditional individual measures, the 33-year-old forward was an afterthought, ranking outside the NBA’s top 300 in PER while placing seventh on the Rockets in points and sixth in touches. But the impact stats told a much different story: Tucker improved the Rockets’ efficiency on offense and defense during the regular season and the playoffs, he boasted a stellar +10.8 net rating, and he ranked No. 87 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus. By February, he had forced his way into the starting lineup, holding that spot throughout the Rockets’ run to the West finals. Not bad for roughly $8 million per year.Tucker, like Battier before him, has carved his niche through pure feistiness. Although he is listed at just 6’6”, he was regularly deployed as a center when coach Mike D’Antoni sought to maximize his lineup’s spacing and switchability. To compensate for his lack of length and shot-blocking ability, Tucker consistently forced opponents to work hard for post position, contested rebounds with abandon, and delivered hard fouls as needed. True to his tough-minded reputation, the former second-round pick also led the Rockets in drawn charges and recovered loose balls. While Tucker might never claim glory like James Harden and Chris Paul, he surely possesses his superstar teammates’ gratitude. — BGAs Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum bucked the norm by playing leading roles on teams that advanced in the playoffs, Markkanen (15.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG) lived a more conventional experience for a lottery pick. The 21-year-old Finnish forward endured months of losing and tanking with the Bulls, he struggled to adjust to his defensive responsibilities, and he missed 14 games due, in part, to minor back injuries. Despite those hurdles, Markkanen was an easy All-Rookie First Team selection because he proved to be a legit marksman with a quick, natural release and range that extended multiple steps beyond the arc. Indeed, the 7-footer drilled 145 threes last season, the most in NBA history by a rookie taller than 6’9”.As the season progressed, his signature pick-and-pop game was supplemented by fake-and-drive action that allowed him to use his length to finish in one-on-one scenarios. While not yet much of a playmaker, Markkanen can handle well enough to locate pull-up shots or get going downhill. On the defensive end, he switched and hit the boards better than expected, but he still ranked outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus due to strength limitations and awareness issues. Markkanen is reportedly adding weight in anticipation of playing more center, a tough ask given that he had the lowest block rate among 7-footers who logged at least 2,000 minutes in 2017-18. The good news is that he projects as such a potent offensive weapon that he only needs to become a passable defender to emerge as the face of Chicago’s youth movement. — BGCoaches tend to lean on Gibson (12.2 PPG, 7.1 RPG) because he makes their lives easier. It’s a relief to have one player on the court who always knows what’s going on, both in the conceptual sense of what a team hopes to accomplish and within the second-to-second frenzy of an NBA game. Don’t underestimate the power of that stability. Nothing about the way Gibson plays basketball is especially modern, but there is a timeless advantage in reliable execution.Gibson has made a career of it. There is never a question of whether he’s game to compete, ready for the moment, or adequately prepared. Some matchups suit Gibson better than others, but that’s just life as a role player. You make do. Smart positional defense will at least keep Gibson in the mix, allowing the rest of his game to pop for opportunistic value. He isn’t an elite rebounder, though Gibson often comes up with the board that matters. His game might not accommodate bulk scoring, but Gibson, who just turned 33, is coming off the most productive and efficient scoring season of his career. He’s a few rungs removed from the league’s truly elite defenders, but Gibson might well come up with the stops to save your season. — RMFew players enhanced their reputations during the 2018 playoffs as much as Rozier (11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.9 APG), who stepped in for the injured Kyrie Irving and guided the Celtics to within one game of the Finals. There were two keys driving the 24-year-old guard’s postseason success. First, a supreme self-confidence. Despite never starting in his first two seasons and being known primarily as a defensive pest, Rozier sent Milwaukee packing from the first round, nailed seven threes in Game 1 against Philadelphia to set the tone in the conference semis, and held tough when LeBron James cranked it up in the East finals. Rather than freeze on the big stage, he tormented Eric Bledsoe, carried himself like a star on the postgame podium, and donned “Scary Terry” t-shirts bearing his own likeness on off days. This was a textbook case of being ready—physically and psychologically—when called upon.The second element of Rozier’s success was easy to miss amid the swagger and hoopla: He played with exceptional control, posting a 5:1 assist-to-turnover ratio in the postseason. While Rozier suffered bouts of streakiness and famously ran cold in Game 7 against the Cavaliers, his careful stewardship throughout the playoffs was crucial to Boston’s efforts to muster enough scoring and to prevail in close games. Going forward, Rozier is an obvious trade chip: He’s equipped to become a full-time starter because he’s trustworthy with the ball, he’s improved his three-point shot, he’s tenacious on defense, and he’s gotten a good taste of the limelight. — BGAminu (9.3 PPG, 7.6 RPG) is the elastic band that holds a top-10 defense together. If you prefer a conservative defensive style—as the Blazers do—then Aminu can muck up passing lanes and slow down top-scoring forwards. If you’d rather rely on switching, he’ll float from opponent to opponent without missing a beat. At the same time, Aminu would look right at home blitzing and recovering against the pick-and-roll, where his length makes a chore of even the most basic outlet pass. One can be a specialist and still have a highly transferable skill set.Of course, not every team is equipped to score around (and at times, in spite of) a marginal threat like Aminu. Every dribble he takes tends to get him deeper into trouble; a lack of practical ball skills leaves Aminu with little recourse in the face of real defensive pressure. Average three-point shooting and offensive rebounding offer some means to contribute, though many of his best looks tend to come by design. Relative to the alternatives, Aminu’s streaky jumper is the kind of attempt a defense can stomach. — RMSchröder’s 2017-18 season was a cry for structure. The only thing standing in the way of his using possessions like a superstar was common sense—a luxury, as it turns out, reserved for teams with better alternatives than Atlanta. Absent those, Schröder did as he pleased.The results were predictably fruitless. Schröder (19.4 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 6.2 APG) put up some of the emptiest numbers in the league last season, considering how little they did for Atlanta’s bottom line. This is emblematic of larger concerns. We know Schröder can beat his man off the dribble and score, but can he bring an offense to balance? Does his passing make his teammates better? Can his length and quickness translate to real defensive benefit? The jury is still out, even within the league. It means something that Schröder is capable of producing at this level, though that “something” varies wildly depending on case and circumstance. — RMAll Sabonis needed was room to play his game. The Thunder didn’t have it; after drafting Sabonis in 2017, Oklahoma City parked him out on the perimeter and grew frustrated when he struggled. A change of scenery jump-started his career. With a trade to the Pacers came gentler expectations – the kind that allow a 22-year-old to try and to fail and to find himself. Sabonis (11.6 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 2.0 APG) was allowed to played to his strengths and develop in his own time.The entire demeanor of Sabonis’s game changed. Gone was the petrified rookie, replaced instead by an intuitive scorer and playmaker. Making decisions off the pick-and-roll and working out of the post gave Sabonis his bearings. These were spaces he knew how to navigate, full of reads he had encountered before. An easy chemistry formed between Sabonis and Victor Oladipo. The Pacers came to rely on him, so much so that Sabonis became the pressure release when Indiana’s guards ran into traps in the postseason. Sabonis isn’t perfect (concern over his lackluster defense is perfectly valid), but the feel he’s shown suggests he’s an uncommon talent. — RMOnce the most fearsome shot-blocker in the league and an ideal smallball center for postseason matchup purposes, Ibaka (12.6 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG) has skidded into an identity crisis. At the root of Ibaka’s troubles is major slippage on the defensive end: Toronto’s defensive rating was better without him last season, and his block rate was less than half of his peak levels during his early-20s. Remarkably, Jonas Valanciunas and Jakob Poeltl both defended more shots within six feet and allowed a lower percentage on those shots than did Ibaka, whose three straight All-Defensive First Team selections already seem like a distant memory.\n",
      "The 2018 playoffs weren’t kind to him either. When Ibaka, 28, was acquired in 2017, he was seen as the piece to help push Toronto over the top and as a rim-protecting linchpin of switchable smallball lineups that could slow down LeBron James. Instead, he largely no-showed in the embarrassing second-round sweep against Cleveland, struggling badly in Game 2 and getting benched in Game 3. At this point, Ibaka is essentially a replacement-level starter whose primary offensive value derives from his three-point shooting because his once-impressive finishing has tapered off. His career arc sadly mirrors that of his former team, the Thunder: He rose to prominence years before everyone expected and then crumbled years before everyone wanted. — BGIt’s easy to bag on Ariza considering how his season ended, but one bad shooting night doesn’t undo all that came before. Ariza (11.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG) was one of the most important players to one of the NBA’s best teams. In the Western Conference finals alone, he was Houston’s best chance of challenging Kevin Durant—a counter to Golden State’s reluctant isolations. Throughout the year, it was Ariza’s defense that gave the Rockets their elasticity. Tucker may have been the point of differentiation from big lineups to small ones, but Ariza was the constant between them.The Rockets will miss him, and Ariza them. Scoring comes easily when James Harden and Chris Paul do so much of the thinking for you. Some 82% of Ariza’s field goals—and damn near all his threes—were assisted last season. His best work comes as a beneficiary, making it difficult to assess his value in a vacuum. Houston barely needed Ariza to dribble, much less create. Most other teams—Phoenix included—would be exposed to a different level of risk. Never underestimate the superstar safety net. — RMYoung (11.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG) lives and works in the background, which seems to suit him just fine. His defense is a quiet sort—the kind predicated on denying position and making timely rotations. When Indiana’s opponents bail out midway through a set play, Young is often the unstated reason why. It’s subtle, but opportunities have a way of vanishing when Young runs interference, assuming that they materialize at all.Young is the defender who phases out Kevin Love, pushing LeBron James to the brink of a first-round elimination. The integrity of Indiana’s entire system hinges on Young’s ability to cover ground. You don’t have to switch pick-and-rolls when a player like Young can cover the gaps. His steal rate was the highest among bigs precisely because he understands how to play the space between show and recover. You won’t get much more than random, opportunistic scoring out of Young, but his court sense brings an added functionality to so many of his team’s pursuits. The Pacers may have been the best story of last season and Young, impressively, their second-best player. — RMEven though Magic Johnson scooped up virtually every available wild card in free agency, the Lakers’ biggest X-factor remains Ingram (16.1 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.9 APG). The 2016 No. 2 pick made clear strides in his second season, emerging as a full-time starter, ratcheting up his scoring and efficiency, improving as a finisher, and becoming more comfortable and less predictable with the ball in his hands. At times, Ingram brought to life the pre-draft projections that he would be a perennial All-Star wing: he displayed the handle and shake necessary to create good shots, he attacked the basket more assertively, and he deployed his spindly length to find seams through the defense and exploit size mismatches.The surest way for the new-look Lakers to make noise in the playoffs would be for Ingram to establish himself as a reliable No. 2 scoring option and a plus defender. To get there, he must continue to extend his range, engage his attack mode with greater consistency, and play more disruptively on the defensive end. He also needs better health, as he was sidelined for a quarter of L.A.’s 2017-18 season. LeBron James’s arrival, of course, should make his life easier: Ingram will face more favorable defensive matchups, receive cleaner catch-and-shoot looks, and play within a more structured and explosive style. After two seasons getting his bearings, it’s time for Ingram’s training wheels to come off for good. — BG  While Wiggins (17.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) has been guilty of playing some of the NBA’s emptiest minutes, he sure does play a lot of them. Indeed, the 2014 No. 1 overall pick has logged a league-leading 11,841 minutes and missed just one game over the last four years. Instead of using that tremendous developmental opportunity as a ramp to superstardom, the 23-year-old wing has sputtered. The major advanced stats agree that his max rookie extension and his reputation as a high-flying scorer both far exceed his on-court value, as he ranked outside the top 200 in PER and Win Shares, outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus, and outside the top 500 in WARP.As each season passes, Wiggins’s lack of follow-through becomes more aggravating. He’s attempting more threes, but he hasn’t yet established himself as a knockdown shooter. He has the body and athletic tools to be a premier defender, but his awareness lags and he’s often passive. He can sky for posters, but he shrinks on the glass. He’s been surrounded by better teammates over the last two seasons, but he hasn’t made meaningful strides as a playmaker. He appeared primed to improve his scoring efficiency as a complementary option to Jimmy Butler, but he settled into wallflower mode instead. Taken together, these burgeoning concerns beg the question: Is Wiggins, the Ironman, also a Tin Man? — BGSo often, the idea of Batum—a lanky, playmaking wing—is more appealing than the reality. You might think of Batum as a strong defender, but his investment on that end comes and goes. One night he might rise to the challenge of guarding an All-Star, and on another he might go through the motions without putting up much resistance. Batum’s shot looks nice, but he’s made just 34% of his threes over the past three years. What promise he offers as a ball-handler is undercut by the fact that he doesn’t get to the rim or draw fouls. (Batum 11.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5.5 APG) may be regarded as a scorer, but last season he barely scraped into double digits while posting an Evan Turnerian true shooting percentage (52.1%).Injury might provide more of a qualifier if not for the larger trends involved. On some level, Batum was surely less comfortable after undergoing surgery on his left elbow last October. His slide, however, extends back through multiple seasons. No one can dispute Batum’s bonafides as a facilitator, though over the last few years he’s become increasingly reliant on that area of his game—less a swiss army knife than a corkscrew. — RMAmid an unspectacular Lakers season, Randle did something notable: He tempered his game. There’s still a battering ram quality to how he plays, though every drive is more pointed than before. Young players have a hard time showing restraint without sacrificing physicality. Randle (16.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 2.6 APG) has managed to tightrope the line between them—not without the occasional misstep, but to the point of becoming an altogether more trustworthy player. Randle’s coaches and teammates no longer have to worry about him veering wildly out of control. Concern, instead, is reserved for the opponent.There’s nothing fun about standing ground against a player this strong, particularly when he has eyes for the rim. Randle can bully his way through other bigs, some traditional centers included, and has the ball skills necessary to create new angles for himself. Batten down the hatches and Randle can simply reroute. Randle will show his age at times (he defends very much like a 23-year-old), though often in ways that hint at what could be. For a third straight year, Randle ramped up his production and efficiency through less-than-ideal circumstances. What might he accomplish for a franchise more invested in his progress? — RMAn incomplete list of things that, for an NBA player, would be easier than scoring on Richardson: Moving a washer/dryer up three flights of stairs; eating a Carolina Reaper; reaching fluency in Mandarin; perfecting hummingbird pose; performing the third movement of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata”; making soufflé that doesn’t collapse; fending off a swarm of bees; beating Hollow Knight to completion; renovating a four-bedroom house by hand; and running a marathon … in crocs. His defense makes even the simplest parts of basketball into something arduous.No matter where you go on the floor or how you choose to operate, Richardson (12.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.9 APG) will be all over you, bodying up and swiping at every turn. Many defenders could manage that for minutes at a time, but what separates Richardson is his endurance. You may tire out, but he never seems to—even as his usage on offense steadily increases. It’s amazing how far Richardson’s offense has come during his three years he in the league. He started out, as many second round picks do, just trying to hit open shots and avoid making mistakes. Now he actually helps the Heat run offense. Richardson did well in his first season in a more operative role and only stands to get better. The arc of a player’s development isn’t determined by age, but by how long they’ve been working in some particular capacity. — RMOrganized basketball is a desperate grasp for control, but sometimes teams are better off leaning into the chaos. Barton (15.7 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 4.1 APG) is a conduit for it—a scorer with a bottomless capacity for surprise. Just when you think you know what Barton might do, he takes the opposite pivot, spins off in a different direction, and converts the kind of shot other players would never think to attempt. The scouting report on Barton is to throw out the scouting report.Barton’s ability—which is considerable—is exceeded by his daring. Gambits like his run the risk of backfire, but they also allow good teams to stretch beyond themselves. A little shake goes a long way. The clearest sign of Barton’s maturation is his understanding of when to let loose. His is the bargain a team can live with. There was never any question of who was better for the Nuggets last season between Barton and the safer Wilson Chandler. One fills minutes capably and predictably. The other actually makes things happen. — RMLike a July 4th cookout or a family trip to the waterpark, a change of address for Howard (16.6 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 1.6 BPG) has become a rite of summer. The eight-time All-Star center has landed in Washington via Charlotte and Brooklyn, continuing a cycle of new GMs dumping him as quickly as possible and desperate GMs talking themselves into a gamble that will almost certainly backfire.The 32-year-old Howard is far removed from his prime years and probably leads the league in worn-out welcomes, but his reputation shouldn’t completely eclipse his performance. Last season, he missed just one game, he made Charlotte better both offensively and defensively when he was on the court, and he was one of only five NBA players to average 12 points and 12 rebounds. While Howard’s defensive impact, mobility and effort have atrophied—thereby limiting his utility in the postseason—he still ranked among the league’s most productive rebounders and finished 70% of his shots in the basket area. It’s too late for the former No. 1 pick to become the player and teammate everyone has hoped for, but he remains a worthy option as a starting center. — BGCousins (25.2 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 1.6 BPG) should be regarded as the NBA’s biggest “What if” of 2018. If the two-time All-NBA center hadn’t blown his Achilles, do the Pelicans still take off down the stretch? Or, do their Twin Towers push the Warriors even harder in the playoffs? Come summertime, does he re-sign in New Orleans on a max deal? Or wind up as the superstar sidekick that LeBron James never found in LA? Or take DeAndre Jordan’s place with the Mavericks? Or become the new face of the Bulls? Remarkably, the actual fallout from Cousins’s injury trumped all those alternate histories: He signed a one-year bargain deal with Golden State, becoming the fifth All-Star in the champs’ projected starting lineup and inciting angry responses from 29 competing fan bases.Stepping back from the injury-induced whirlwind, it’s worth noting that Cousins’s year-plus stint in New Orleans didn’t provide definitive answers to the major questions that dogged him in Sacramento. Nine seasons in, he still hasn’t played in a playoff game. His raw stats—on par with prime Shaquille O’Neal—haven’t translated to elite team performance. And, at 28, he is still plagued by emotional outbursts and ejections. Nevertheless, Cousins was correct when he called his summer signing a “chess move,” as the Warriors can slow-play his rehabilitation, lighten his load, and afford to hold him to a higher personal standard.If healthy, Cousins would have placed in the top 25, but SI’s Top 100 is a one-year exercise, and this ranking assumes Cousins will miss roughly half the season, play reduced minutes upon his return, and perform at roughly 60% of his capabilities due to his age and the serious nature of his injury. — BGIndiana is still waiting on Turner. To date, the 22-year-old has been a tantalizing but only moderately effective NBA player. The shooting he brings to a lineup is nice, though Turner (12.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG) has yet to graduate from pick-and-pop specialty. He has the presence to protect the rim, if not the expertise to guarantee it; too often he’s positioned a half-step removed from where he should be or stuck a half-second behind the action, as is so common for bigs of his age and experience level. So many of the necessary skills are there. Any delay, then, comes from learning how to best apply them.This ranking is a balance. Turner has the profile of a player who could take a big step this season but still faces a burden of proof in pulling it all together. Development is rarely linear. There will be fits and starts, breakthroughs and frustrations. Maybe last season could have gone differently for Turner if he weren’t dealing with an elbow injury or gradually recovering from a concussion. All we know for certain is what we saw: another decent season with some marginal improvement and all the hallmarks of a player still finding his place in the league. — RMWhy wait until he retires? The NBA should invite Gordon (17.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 2.3 APG) to speak at the annual rookie symposium right now, as the 2014 lottery pick can already attest to the good, the bad and the ugly of professional basketball. Gordon, 22, is about to play for his fifth coach in five seasons. He’s endured four seasons with 35 or fewer wins and multiple core-altering trades. He’s deployed a hoverboard and a drone in a pair of memorable Slam Dunk Contest appearances. He’s been played out of position and seen his name listed in possible trade scenarios in a leaked photo of his front office’s whiteboard. And Rob Hennigan, the GM who drafted Gordon, spent years on the hot seat before he was finally fired.Aside from his evident explosiveness, defensive versatility and good-natured disposition, Gordon still presents more questions than answers. He’s best suited to playing the four and has ramped up his perimeter shooting, but he’s not yet consistent enough to be a true stretch option. He has the agility and motor to be a plus defender, but he’s not a traditional rim-protecting presence and is better suited to life outside the paint. Most of all, he’s emerged as a higher-volume scorer, but he’s done so with below-par efficiency on a team that hasn’t played meaningful games after Thanksgiving. On the bright side, Gordon has a new four-year, $80 million contract to show for his hard knocks, a pact that will keep analysts guessing about his value until Orlando finally finds a path back to relevance. — BG    Harris (18.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 2.4 APG) has played for four teams in seven seasons, but he’s developed into far more than a journeyman as he’s entered his prime. In fact, the combo forward’s inclusion in a midseason trade for Blake Griffin provided an excellent opportunity to appreciate his potent and flexible offensive game. While Griffin is more imposing, more decorated and far more famous, Harris plugged seamlessly into the Clippers’ starting lineup at less than half of Griffin’s price. L.A. went 17-15 after the trade, as Harris displayed improved perimeter shooting and the ability to score without hijacking the offense.Like many stretch fours, the 26-year-old Harris often finds himself in mismatches defensively, as he lacks length and lateral quickness. He’s made some progress in terms of awareness on that end, though, and his growth as an off-the-dribble threat helps offset his defensive deficiencies. Although under-qualified to be an alpha scorer due to his limited playmaking for others, Harris would add value to any team hoping to modernize its offense. Unlike Griffin, he’s an easy piece to fit. — BGAlthough Nurkic (14.3 PPG, 9 RPG, 1.4 BPG) just completed his rookie deal, he has rewritten virtually every aspect of his scouting profile. During two-plus seasons in Denver, the Bosnian 7-footer couldn’t finish, couldn’t protect the ball, couldn’t handle big minutes, couldn’t stay healthy, couldn’t serve as a functional backline defender, and couldn’t get along with his coach. Following a 2017 trade, the Blazers embarked on an “Extreme Makeover: Starting Center” mission, encouraging Nurkic to trim down, communicating his role to him clearly, empowering him to pursue his own offense, and entrusting him with major defensive responsibilities.Nurkic, 24, responded in a big way in 2017-18, playing in 79 games and logging more than 2,000 minutes, well above his previous career-highs. He wasn’t just eating up minutes: Nurkic helped Portland improve from No. 21 to No. 8 in defensive rating, he dramatically increased his FG% around the basket, he cut his turnover rate, and he learned to swallow his pride when pulled for match-up purposes in late-game situations. All that progress didn’t help him avoid being torched by Anthony Davis in the playoffs, but it did earn him a four-year, $48 million extension this summer. Next up on the to-do list: ease up on the low-percentage runners, floaters and flip shots that drive Blazermaniacs berserk. — BGAs the NBA has plunged deeper into the smallball era, perception of Valanciunas (12.7 PPG, 8.6 RPG) has seesawed wildly. Once viewed as a potential All-Star, the Lithuanian center became a case study for natural selection on the hardwood: What chance did a lumbering 7-footer have of staying on the court during the playoffs? Rather than overhauling his game to become a full-fledged stretch five, Valanciunas has evolved in softer fashion: exerting maximum effort in fewer minutes, seeking out and exploiting undersized defenders for high-percentage scoring opportunities, dabbling with the three ball, and gradually improving his feel and confidence when forced to defend away from the hoop.The result? Valanciunas, 26, proved to be a skilled battering ram in the 2018 playoffs, notching six double-doubles in 10 games, outplaying Washington’s Marcin Gortat in the first round, and pounding the Cavaliers for 21 points and 21 rebounds in Game 1 of the second round. Yes, the Raptors eventually went down in ugly fashion, but Valanciunas was hardly their weakest link. With excellent durability, well-honed post moves and greater comfort in his refashioned role, Valanciunas has managed to stave off stylistic extinction and trade rumors alike. — BGIt makes perfect sense that Redick (17.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 3.0 APG) would leave the most comfortable fit of his NBA career at age 33 and go on to have his best season yet. Philadelphia made Redick a focal point; he might not have led the Sixers in shot attempts or usage, but Redick’s movement without the ball gave the entire offense its shape. Not many shooters could bear the weight of that kind of role. It works for Redick because of how fluidly he transitions from sprint to shot, making some of the hardest shots in the game look easy.Redick could bring that skill set anywhere, modulating his role as necessary to fit whatever his circumstances require. There is an immutable baseline value for a career 42 % three-point shooter who can hold his own defensively. Redick is more than that. The way he takes the ball in a dribble hand-off and reads the next play in sequence opens up the scope of the entire offense. His screens—yes, screens—throw defenders completely out of sorts. It all comes from the versatility of Redick’s form and release, which allow him to touch so many more aspects of an offense than you might expect. — RMWilliams (22.6 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 5.3 APG) was the easy choice for Sixth Man of the Year last season not because he exemplified the award, but because he transcended it. Bench players don’t score more than 20 points per game (Williams is the first to do so in nearly 30 years). They don’t work as a team’s primary scoring option (Williams not only led the Clippers in assist percentage and overall usage, but used roughly as many possessions as Anthony Davis, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, and DeMar DeRozan). Yet Williams, miraculously, pulled it off—transforming from a novelty scorer into the leader of a top-10 offense.Let’s give credit where it’s due. Williams may be a crummy, undersized defender, but he’s enough of a dynamo to overcome that. Years of clever play have allowed Williams to craft his own unique style through experimentation. One can find incredible latitude when his primary job is to get buckets, and through it Williams has tested thousands of permutations of fakes and footwork to find what works best for him. The more the league leans toward switching defenses, the more valuable players like Williams—who can dutifully run a pick-and-roll or dance their way through an isolation—become. — RMWas Mirotic (15.6 PPG, 7.4 RPG) the biggest winner of the 2018 trade deadline? One minute, he’s in the hospital thanks to a Bobby Portis punch and dreading a return to the aimless, hapless Bulls. The next, he’s joyriding with the Pelicans’ Anthony Davis in one of the NBA’s most exciting offenses, exploding for 30 points in a playoff game while sweeping the Blazers, and cashing Gillette endorsement checks after shaving his trademark beard. What a glow up.The Pelicans were magical when Davis and Mirotic shared the court, posting a +12 net rating in more than 500 minutes. By comparison, New Orleans was +5.9 in roughly 1,100 minutes with Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. In many ways, Mirotic was the anti-Cousins: He was comfortable playing fast, he was accustomed to life as a complementary option, he rarely turned the ball over, he handled switches, and he moved effectively in space on defense. What’s more, he was strong enough on the boards that New Orleans was able to play its preferred smaller lineups, even in the playoffs. For a winning team, the streaky Mirotic is more than a stereotypical stretch four: He does enough dirty work to justify a major role even when he’s slumping. — BGBarnes (18.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.0 APG) is not a first-option scorer, as he’s been cast in Dallas, or a fifth option, as he was in Golden State. His game fits neatly in between, where it can funnel some moderate number of possessions toward mildly efficient ends. It’s nice, though, that he can at least dabble on both extremes of the usage spectrum. The strength of Barnes’s game comes through its variety. Not many spot-up shooters would look just as comfortable working in isolation, or curling around a screen, or posting up a mismatch. And while he’s not exceptional enough in any one category to actually give a team some direction, he’s flexible enough to bend in support of those around him.Teams can play Barnes at the three (as seems to be his preference) or the four without much compromise. There is virtually no risk of him getting played off the floor by a mismatch. Small ball and bully ball alike suit him just fine; if anything, Barnes might be even better at stonewalling bigs trying to work their way to the rim than he is shuffling to stay in front of opposing wings. What matters most, though, is that he’s never a target. Featuring Barnes—whether as the lead in an offense or the focus of an opponent’s game plan—will often lead to underwhelming results. — RMTeague (14.2 PPG, 7.0 APG) is good. Not very good. Not elite. Not average. Not bad. The nine-year veteran is a Trader Joe’s prepackaged dinner, a 3.0 grade point average, a starter home, an L.L. Bean backpack, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with no cone or toppings. He satisfies basic needs and rarely excites. In dark days, his thorough competence inspires faint hope. In better times, he inevitably leaves fans wanting more.As his 2017 arrival in Minnesota proved, the 30-year-old Teague is the right point guard to end a 13-year playoff drought and the right point guard to exit meekly in round one. The Timberwolves boasted the NBA’s fourth-best offense last season, as Teague spread the ball around to his star teammates and filled in the gaps with his own scoring when needed. But he hit a familiar hard ceiling in the playoffs, outmatched and, at times, embarrassed by Houston’s premier backcourt. True to form, he received little attention for his role in Minnesota’s best season since 2004; Likewise, his name was nowhere to be found in the rumors of discontent that have engulfed his higher-profile teammates. As it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. “Good” doesn’t make headlines. — BGRubio (13.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 5.3 APG) is prone to weeks-long mirages of effective shooting, in which it appears—for some fleeting moment—that his long-range accuracy has turned a corner. The back half of last season was the most prolonged and compelling fantasy yet: 41 games in which Rubio made 41% of his threes, coinciding with Utah playing genuinely dominant basketball. That figure will not hold. But to be fair, it doesn’t have to. Given where Rubio is coming from (31.5% shooting on three-pointers over his first six years in the league), even modest, reliable improvement could be transformative.When you’re already one of the best defenders, passers, and rebounders at your position, a smaller step forward can feel like a stride. There are two factors at work (and thus two parallel reasons to believe in his progress last season): Rubio has now posted a career-high effective field goal percentage in three straight seasons, showing a clear developmental arc; and separately, only now is Rubio playing for a coaching staff that seems to really understand him. You can’t just plug Rubio into any system and hope for the best. Utah gets that, and has found ways to push their point guard without missing the boat on what makes him so valuable in the first place. — RM If you were to ask a basketball coach to describe their ideal role player, they might unknowingly profile Ingles (11.5 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 4.8 APG). Think about it. They’d want someone who’s easy to play with, like a pass-first wing player who also happens to be one of the best three-point shooters in the league. Beyond that, they’d want someone with enough of a handle to initiate some offense and enough vision to make smart plays. Defensive commitment is a given, and the ability to guard multiple positions is a perk. The player would need to be intensely competitive, but it’s best if they’re also unassuming. Coaches would want the kind of player who understands his team’s principles enough to know when to break them—a delicate blend of reliability and creativity.It’s not hard to find more athletic or higher-scoring players. The trick is finding many who are as good as Ingles when it comes to supplying the things that teams actually need. — RM While Murray (16.7 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.4 APG) wasn’t necessarily expected to have an instant impact when he was drafted at age 19, he’s already emerged as a full-time starter and the 2016 class’s leader in games, minutes and points. Now 21, the Canadian product is a prime example of the Stephen Curry Generation: young guards who are encouraged to launch three-pointers at a rate that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. In his second year, Murray attempted more than five threes per game, a threshold that Curry himself didn’t reach until his fourth season at age 24.Denver’s archer is just getting started. After barely missing the playoffs last year, Murray looks like a strong candidate for 2019 Most Improved Player: His per-game stats and efficiency substantially improved in Year Two, he helped lead the Nuggets to 46 wins and the NBA’s No. 6 offense, and his natural scoring instincts proved to be a strong fit with Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris. The hope is that Murray can hone his off-the-dribble three-pointer, a development that could help him join Curry in the 50/40/90 shooting club once his all-around game blossoms. A lack of size and physicality compromise his defensive value, but Murray is fiercer and more competitive than most people realize. Aside from top pick Ben Simmons, he may have the highest ceiling of any player in the 2016 draft. — BG For Saric (14.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 2.6 APG), instinct is a propulsive force. The 24-year-old has a preternatural sense of where to be and when. By the time Ben Simmons commits to making a pass, Saric has already raced through the backdoor on his way to the rim. He has a knack for turning up around any loose ball. If the defense is careless enough to box out without securing the rebound, Saric will be the first to it. Should an opponent get careless with a dribble hand-off, Saric might sniff out their negligence and poke the ball away.It’s not easy for a team to build off of that kind of situational awareness, but we saw in the postseason just how fruitful it can be. Saric was completely undaunted by his first playoff run. He stuck to his game—a dynamic mix of cutting, shooting, and playmaking—and found room to contribute across the board. There were always higher priorities for the Sixers than to get Saric involved, and yet he constantly worked his way into the mix. For all the careful planning that goes into an NBA game, sometimes it’s up to players like Saric to help a team find their flow. — RMIn the beginning, Bledsoe (17.7 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.0 APG) requested a trade from the Suns on Twitter—“I don’t wanna be here”—and then tried to deny it by pretending he was merely bored at a hair salon. In the end, he was outplayed and outtalked in the playoffs by Celtics guard Terry Rozier, who confused Bledsoe with a long-forgotten NFL quarterback who shared his surname. In between those memorable memes, the powerful, scoring-minded point guard managed to squeeze in a nice season, providing stability and talent to a Milwaukee backcourt that desperately needed both.Following a November trade to Milwaukee, Bledsoe quickly found his fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, boosting his new team’s offensive rating by nearly eight points when he took the court. While his defensive impact was muted given his propensity for risk-taking and brain farts, Bledsoe’s presence kept the Bucks’ season from being derailed by Malcolm Brogdon’s long-term injury. On balance, his Milwaukee experience revealed that his eye-popping stats from his Phoenix days were inflated, but that he was capable of being an above-average starting point guard on a winning team. Even if it’s not yet clear whether he’s a long-term answer in Milwaukee, the 28-year-old Bledsoe proved to be a heck of a midseason acquisition. — BG  If healthy, Porzingis (22.7 PPG, 6.6 RPG) would have had a strong case as a top–20 player. By record and point differential, the 2017-18 Knicks were a playoff bubble team with the Latvian big man on the court. After he suffered a season-ending ACL tear in early February, though, New York was pitiful, ranking No. 28 in winning percentage and No. 26 in net rating. Porzingis was on track to solidifying his reputation as a franchise player, and his unfortunate injury was the difference for the Knicks between being competitive and noncompetitive, relevant and irrelevant, watchable and unwatchable.The 23-year-old “Unicorn” lived up to his moniker last season, delivering a positive impact on both sides. He ranked No. 16 in scoring and No. 2 in blocks, shot nearly 40% as a high volume three-point shooter, and allowed just 48.7 FG% on shots attempted within six feet, a basket-protection rate that bested Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis. Unfortunately, the greatest ability is availability, and it’s not yet clear when Porzingis will return to the court or if he will return to his peak level of play during the 2018-19 season. — BGRudy Gobert casts a long shadow, the kind that obscures just how good his frontcourt partner can be. If transported to another team, Favors (12.3 PPG, 7.3 RPG) could anchor a defense all his own with even greater optionality. Gobert is the sort of defender whose strengths are so specific and so pronounced that they all but commit a team to defending a particular way. Any schematic discussion regarding Favors is more open-ended; his team could drop against the pick-and-roll, pressure the ball, switch outright, or even rotate between those options as some highly effective defenses do. No matter the approach, Favors is the kind of big you can trust to execute it.Or, if you’re the Jazz, you can roll out Favors and Gobert in tandem to stomp opponents down by 7.3 points per 100 possessions in the regular season and 10.9 points in the playoffs. Consider those data points with the necessary disclaimers (namely, that the Jazz limit the exposure of those big lineups in matchups they’re poorly suited for), but the reality of playing Favors at the four is less dated than one might think. For opponents other than the Rockets or Warriors, Favors can be punishing. Smaller forwards just don’t have much recourse when Favors rolls to the rim, but playing a more traditional big to counter Favors then plays right into the hands of the Jazz defense. Players don’t need to be dominant to help turn a specific matchup. They need only to have the right combination of skills at the right time, as Favors often does. — RMThe Suns have thrown every conceivable monkey wrench at Booker (24.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.7 APG) during his three seasons: changing coaches, trading away veterans, tanking for months, and whiffing on high draft picks. The 21-year-old shooting guard has responded in admirable fashion, improving his overall efficiency and becoming one of the highest-scoring young prospects in recent memory. Indeed, only four active players averaged more points than Booker during their age-21 seasons: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and Karl-Anthony Towns. By forking over a five-year, $158 million extension this summer, Phoenix is betting that Booker can follow in that group’s All-Star footsteps and lift his team’s 30th-ranked offense to far greater potency.The Kentucky product still needs to prove he’s worthy of his Drake namecheck on “Sicko Mode,” largely because he plays with pick-up game intensity on the defensive end. Phoenix has had a worse defensive rating with Booker on the court than with him off the court in each of his three seasons, and he ranked outside the NBA’s top 200 players by Real Plus-Minus in 2017-18. If he played one-on-one against himself, the game would continue for hours because he would never get a stop. If he played for a better team, he would be hunted mercilessly in the playoffs. With Deandre Ayton and Trevor Ariza arriving to help stabilize and legitimize the Suns, it’s time for Booker to fully commit to leading a downtrodden franchise back to respectability. While Booker reportedly underwent hand surgery this week, the injury did not impact his Top 100 ranking because he's not expected to miss a significant portion of the regular season. — BGHouston has stretched every bit of Gordon’s (18.0 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 2.2 APG) game to its logical extreme. Gordon is remarkably strong for a guard, which means that the Rockets trust him to hold his own defensively against far bigger players. Opponents respect Gordon’s perimeter shooting, so Houston stations him far beyond the three-point arc to clear room for its pick-and-rolls—perhaps at the expense of Gordon’s three-point percentage. What used to be a more balanced shot profile has since polarized; in a fashion suiting Houston’s guiding principles, Gordon now takes well over 60% of his shots from beyond the arc. What mid-range shots he takes are largely provisional—products of when Gordon is asked to create some offense for himself. — RMCovington (12.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 1.7 SPG) warps around the court like a podcast played at double speed, he relishes contact like a middle linebacker, and he shadows scorers feint-for-feint like a professional dancer. With a full season of good health and team success to his name, the 27-year-old Sixers forward has solidified himself as the NBA’s premier 3-and-D wing. His 2018 All-Defensive First Team selection was a no-brainer, as he ranked first in deflections, third in Defensive Real-Plus Minus, fifth in Defensive Win Shares and sixth in steals for the NBA’s third-best defense.Although he is considerably older than star teammates Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, Covington stumbled badly during their first trip to the playoffs. A notoriously streaky shooter who managed to hit 36.9% of his threes during the regular season, he was yanked from the starting lineup in the second round against the Celtics when his jumper and confidence deserted him. Despite a rough May and the narrow nature of his offensive portfolio, Covington is perfectly suited for trendy interchangeable and switchable lineups. He’s satisfied filling a supplementary scoring role, and his combination of strength, length and quickness allows him to credibly defend four, if not all five, positions in smallball looks. Here’s betting that his future postseason work is considerably stronger than his 2018 showing. — BG Something about Brown (14.5 PPG, 4.9 RPG) is undeniable. Maybe it’s the way he takes borderline transition opportunities—the kind that other players might slow down and reset—and jams them down the opponent’s throat. It could be wholeheartedness in his soaring contests, each making the dutiful spectacular. More likely, it’s just the fact that Brown plays so hard on both sides of the ball that he’s never far away from some thrilling turn. What looks to be a standard, slow-developing possession can pop with a single cut or deflection. Even within Boston’s particular methodology, Brown knows only how to play in vivid color.It’s no surprise that he’s caught the eye of so many teams around the league, all of which would be thrilled to have a stake in Brown’s future. It took Brown all of two seasons to stabilize as a three-point shooter and calm some of the jumpier aspects of his defense. What might he be capable of in Year Three? Playing out the developmental scenarios is part of the fun, particularly when considering the counterfactuals of the past year.In a world where Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving don’t go down with season-ending injuries, Brown might be seen as more of an energy player than a potential star. Instead, he was force-fed royal jelly while essentially doubling his minutes. So many of the questions that come with young, high-motor players have already been asked and answered. We’ve seen that Brown can sustain his play in starters’ minutes. We know that he can withstand the scrutiny of playoff scouting. What’s beyond us is the future of a fascinating young player whose ceiling is at the mercy of any number of sliding doors. — RMGive Drummond (15 PPG, 16 RPG, 1.6 BPG) credit for seeking methods to evolve his game rather than settling for the dunk-and-rebound stereotype. Last season, the two-time All-Star center reclaimed his status as the NBA’s leading rebounder while also emerging as a capable distributor from the high post and a much-improved foul shooter. Then, in August, he vowed to add the three-point shot to his offensive repertoire after attempting just 30 total threes in his first six seasons.Unfortunately, Drummond’s explorative forays haven’t always produced clear progress in terms of his individual value or his team’s success. While his assist rate improved dramatically in 2017-18, so did his turnover rate. And while all sorts of centers are plotting how they can transform into stretch-fives, Drummond hasn’t exactly demonstrated much touch: He shot an abysmal 31.4% on shots from 3-10 feet and 28.6 from the mid-range last year. Frankly, the Pistons’ offense would be better off if he was never allowed to shoot from outside three feet. On the other end, the Drummond/Blake Griffin tandem fared well in a small sample size, providing some much-needed optimism for the wheel-spinning Pistons. Drummond, 25, might never fulfill his wildest dreams, but his size, durability, rebounding instincts and gradual refinements set him apart from replacement-level starting centers. — BGDragić (17.3 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 4.8 APG) plays a dramatic game, forever teetering on the edge of disaster. His signature is to go a step too far; no guard seems to find themselves double- and triple-teamed in the lane quite so often, and none, surely, has been so successful at improbably digging his way out. Some of Dragić’s layups require incredible contortions. His exit strategy often involves hovering in the air until he can sling some wild, wraparound pass. The result is often so impressive—and so improbable—that you forget that the peril was of Dragić’s own making.Yet for all his theatrics, Dragić settles in as merely quite good. It’s not as if his dramatic flair has proven self-destructive; on the contrary, Dragić only turns the ball over at a modest rate relative to other point guards. Miami seems comfortable running its offense through Dragić rather than for him. There are always larger plans at work, and not much of a compelling reason to assign Dragić some outsized role. Two important aspects of Dragić’s game, however, are never up for debate. The first is his fight, which is exceptional even in a competitive league. Dragić is a feisty sort who will never hesitate to drive into traffic, even after his face has swollen to cartoonish extremes. The other is his all-around competence—faint praise, perhaps, but the kind that makes the NBA go. — RMIn the past year, Harris (17.5 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 2.9 APG) proved that he can not only produce within an offense but give it structure. Dribble hand-offs between Harris and Nikola Jokic were as fundamental to Denver’s flow as any other mechanism. Jokic makes Harris look good, but the opposite is also true; a beautiful backdoor feed is only as effective as the cutter who inspires it.Part of what makes Harris so elusive is that you can never be sure where he’s going. Kyle Korver knows how to move without the ball but only has designs to move away from the basket. Andre Roberson is similarly unidirectional, albeit on the opposite track; the only time a defense even pays attention to Roberson’s movement is when he’s headed toward the rim. Harris is a dual threat and more. He could cut off a screen or reject it, move toward the ball or away from it, fake hard in any one direction before reversing course for the other, and take any angle he likes after finally receiving the ball. This is the predicament involved when a player shoots 72% within three feet of the rim and 40% beyond the arc. There is no safe assumption a defender can make —only the tireless work of chasing Harris everywhere he goes. — RMThe departures of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin granted a perfect opportunity to reassess Jordan (12 PPG, 15.2 RPG), a three-time All-NBA selection who served as a third wheel throughout his prime years. The results were mixed: the 30-year-old center remains an elite rebounder and high-efficiency finisher, but his overall defensive impact and rim-protection numbers slipped noticeably.Any faint hope that he might be able to expand his offensive game proved unfounded. After spending a full decade with the Clippers, Jordan drew limited interest and eventually agreed to a one-year, $22.9 million contract with the Mavericks.While Jordan remains an above-average center with standout leaping ability and a deep commitment to hitting the boards, he’s lost some of the pop that made him so devastating. Last season, Jordan’s block rate fell by more than half from his 2016 All-NBA First Team campaign. What’s more, he defended just 346 shots from within six feet (down more than a quarter from two years ago) and allowed 60.4% shooting on those shots (up 8.5% from two years ago). Not surprisingly, the Clippers dropped to 19th in defensive rating from their top-five standing two years ago. When the Mavericks courted Jordan in the fateful summer of 2015, they pitched him on life as a franchise center. At this point, that’s no longer realistic. — BGPorter (14.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) isn’t one to amaze—only to steady his team with quiet capability. The vast majority of his shots are created for him, though Porter adds value the moment the ball touches his hands. If open on the perimeter, Porter (who finished third in three-point percentage last season) is a lights-out shooter with a high release point. Should the defense give his shot the respect it deserves, Porter can drive in response without veering out of control. Restraint is the through line of his game. One can always trust in Porter to play within himself, gifting his coaches and teammates a certain peace of mind. Porter is the player you never have to worry about.These are virtues best appreciated in contrast. If a team were composed entirely of players with Porter’s disposition, the offense might seesaw into eternity one non-committal pick-and-roll at a time. Yet in any more typical ecosystem, Porter would be welcome for his range, his patience, and his defense. Two-way, low-maintenance players are championship mortar. What Porter needs are the right bricks.If an opponent really wanted to scheme away Porter’s offense, they could. There’s nothing particularly intricate going on in how he gets his points. But attaching a defender to deny Porter shots will still serve his intended purpose, making life that much easier on the creators around him. Reducing the game to 4-on-4 will favor any competent offense. Porter, meanwhile, can still assume critical defensive responsibilities and facilitate his team’s best lineups by flexing between positions. Nothing is wasted with Porter, even when he assumes a background role. — RMLast season, Griffin (21.4 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 5.8 APG) posted a points/rebounds/assists line that was matched only by a pair of MVPs: LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. But that superstar-like productivity came draped with red flags: Griffin missed at least 15 games for the fourth straight season, his teams were 28-30 with him on the court, he ranked outside the top-50 in Real Plus-Minus, and his PER and True Shooting % reached career-lows. Unfortunately, a midseason trade to Detroit failed to reverse these trends. That blockbuster deal was harsh and illuminating, as it marked the first time that the Clippers had treated Griffin—whose dynamic athleticism has flatlined due to a series of injuries—as a $173 million contract rather than as a franchise player.As Griffin has sought to modernize his game and protect his body by playmaking from the perimeter and shooting more threes, he’s triggered an identity crisis. After the trade to the Pistons, he took just 21% of his shots from within three feet, well off the 44% from his peak posterization days. Similarly, he attempted just 4.4 free throws per game after the trade, sharply down from 8.4 per game back when he was an MVP candidate. The overwhelming night-to-night physicality that once made Griffin so special appears gone for good at age 29, leaving him as a good-but-not-great scoring threat and an adequate defender. — BGYes, 2017-18 was a junk season for the Grizzlies, and for Gasol, accordingly. Don’t read too much into his downward statistical trend (17.2 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 4.2 APG); once it became clear that Memphis had no shot to compete without Mike Conley, Gasol freewheeled his way through the season without all that much discipline or focus. Give him a real team and he’ll put forth a real effort. Take from that what you will. It might be nice if Gasol were the sort to rally the troops in spite of those circumstances, but there’s only so much playing with Jarell Martin and Ben McLemore a man can take.Decline, however, is inevitable. Gasol’s defense has already slipped; the player who won Defensive Player of the Year by keeping one step ahead of the action is gone thanks to slowing feet and reaction times. Gasol is a 33-year-old center at an especially difficult time to be a 33-year-old center. Just last season, there were only four true bigs who played more than 2,000 minutes at age 32 or older: Gasol, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Marcin Gortat. Every year it will get a little tougher for Gasol to manage a star’s workload in a star’s minutes with a star’s responsibilities.What keeps him buoyant is his playmaking. A team can run its offense through Gasol by stationing him at the elbow or at the three-point line and running guards around him. Orienting an offense in that way opens up the player pool; when a point guard doesn’t have to shoulder the weight of the offense, all sorts of combo guards and kind-of-guards become more viable. New avenues into the offense present themselves. The only way to survive a long season and an ensuing playoff run is through frequent adaptation. Think of Gasol as a means for problem solving—not only to get the ball where it needs to go, but to keep the best players on the floor and arrange them in the most productive ways. — RMThe Boston media spent months comparing Tatum (13.9 PPG, 5 RPG) to NBA legends and predicting a decade’s worth of All-Star appearances for the rookie forward, and then a funny thing happened in the playoffs: He somehow exceeded the hype. Tatum scored 20 points in a Game 7 win over Milwaukee. He easily outdueled 2018 Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons, scoring 20+ points in all five second-round games. And, most impressively of all, he played a leading role in pushing Cleveland to Game 7 in the East finals, where he famously dunked on and chest-bumped LeBron James. Suddenly, the entire global basketball community was gushing like Tommy Heinsohn over Tatum’s poise, polish and gumption.Tatum, 20, possesses all the fundamental elements to become a star wing. He has an effortless shooting stroke, nailing a preposterous 43.4% of his threes as a rookie. He knows a good shot from a bad shot, and he can create quality looks off the dribble and with an array of turnaround moves. He has excellent footwork and pacing. He isn’t reckless or selfish with the ball. He’s quick, long, smart and committed defensively. The biggest question at this point seems to be how quickly Tatum will reach his ceiling in Boston, given that the returns of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward could potentially cut into his touches and shots. Regardless, this much seems clear: Tatum is too skilled to be buried, even on a budding superteam. — BGAdams (13.9 PPG, 9.0 RPG) played the third-most minutes of any center in the league last season because 1) he tends to stay healthy, and 2) he can’t be played off the floor. Any attempt to weed out Adams all but fails before it starts. Small ball is no real deterrent. Adams can hold his own on the perimeter to the point that he isn’t easily exploited. Meanwhile, some poor, undersized center is left to contend with one of the strongest players in the league. If Adams can politely nudge opposing centers out of the way when necessary, what hope does a power forward masquerading as a center really have?The real payoff for that strength comes on offense, where the Thunder grabbed 31.6% of their own misses with Adams on the floor last season, per NBA.com. This is an offense unto itself. Adams may not be scoring all that much, but his efforts renew possessions and redeem low shooting percentages. Solvency comes easy when a team is allowed to take a mulligan on nearly a third of its misses, and potentially more when no true center is around to box Adams out. There’s just no working around the fact that Adams is a proper giant. He can wipe out a guard with a screen and bulldoze a big with a roll. Players of that size aren’t supposed to move around the floor so easily, and yet here is Adams, gliding through contact after teaching himself how. You might not consider Adams a standout athlete, but he’s made himself into one. — RMDenver’s bold, expensive off-season play for Millsap (14.6 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.8 APG) had fizzled by Thanksgiving due to a wrist injury that sidelined the four-time All-Star forward for more than half of last season. Although Millsap posted his worst individual numbers in nearly a decade and the Nuggets failed to reach the playoffs for the fifth straight year, there were some promising signs. For starters, Denver posted a +4.1 net rating with Millsap on the court—equivalent to the league’s No. 6 ranking—and he made the Nuggets more efficient on both sides. Perhaps most importantly, Millsap and Nikola Jokic posted a strong +8 net rating in nearly 900 minutes together, providing convincing evidence that the frontcourt pairing will work well in 2018-19 if healthy.The 33-year-old Millsap has entered the decline stage of a typical age curve, yet his role flexibility should help soften the blow. Thanks to his unselfish nature and capable three-point shooting, he doesn’t need to dominate the ball to be a helpful offensive player. His willingness to shift down to a complementary role—something some former All-Stars reject outright—provides room for the Nuggets’ young backcourt to blossom. Plus, his savvy, workmanlike and versatile defensive game provides cover for the multiple minus defenders that surround him in the starting lineup. If the Nuggets vault into the playoffs as some projection models expect, Millsap’s fingerprints will be all over the rise even if he is overshadowed by his flashier teammates. — BG Were there no concern for injury, Conley—a two-way, All-Star-level guard—would rank far better than he does here. To actually follow through on that ranking, however, would require rationalizing away the 109 games that Conley missed over the past three years. There is no single, chronic injury at work but an assortment of seemingly unrelated issues. The latest was a bone intrusion in his left heel, addressed through surgery back in January. Conley is as resilient as athletes come, but his resilience is also tested more often than most. Any predictive ranking must account for that, particularly with Conley now in his early 30s.This disclaimer is made with the full knowledge that a healthy Conley is a freaking terror. Very few point guards can match his creative depth; Conley has the handle and quickness to go anywhere he wants on the floor, not to mention the skill and touch to score when he gets there. Conley’s game is setups on setups on setups. What looks like an actual move—and would be in lesser hands—is really just prologue, scripted to set expectations for the sole purpose of defying them. By the time Conley’s defender realizes they’re stuck in the blender, it’s already too late.There’s no weak hand to shade, and no range at which you can give Conley space. The last time we saw Conley really do his thing, he was bombing away from beyond the arc with the frequency of Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, and Devin Booker—all while hitting better than 40%. His array of runners is the envy of the league. Some scoring option is always available to him, though Conley is perfectly willing to move the ball and defer to the offense. The most dangerous moment in guarding Conley comes then: At the moment of exhale, before it clicks that he only gave up the ball to get it back on a dribble hand-off. — RMAs one of the NBA’s top young centers, it’s no surprise that Capela (13.9 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 1.9 BPG) has buttered his bread in the basket area: He shot a league-high 65.2% thanks to a parade of lobs, defended a league-high 588 shots from within six feet, and ranked eighth with 42 double-doubles. Unlike many of his positional counterparts, though, the 24-year-old Capela has found numerous ways to inject mobility into possessions. He doesn’t camp on the block looking for post-up opportunities, and he covers ground from end to end like few players his size. Even when Houston goes to its slow-down half-court isolation mode, Capela darts through space to set high screens and knifes through multiple bodies to chase offensive rebounds.In the West finals, Capela’s unique combination of length, agility and activity made him surprisingly resilient against the Warriors. Houston’s two favorite lineups against Golden State both featured Capela instead of a small-ball five, and together the groups were a net-positive over the seven-game series. He can’t play-make or shoot the three like Draymond Green, but Capela represents a new archetype for a modern title contender: a rim-running, screen-setting, alley-ooping, glass-crashing and shot-blocking center who can show and switch against all five positions without getting embarrassed. Houston, understanding Capela’s rare skill profile, wisely inked him to a five-year, $90 million deal in late July. — BGHis game has drawn endless comparisons to Dwyane Wade and his marketability is straight from the Damian Lillard playbook, but the recent star that Mitchell (20.5 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.7 APG) most embodied down the stretch was a young Derrick Rose. The unadulterated calm and confidence. The willingness to sacrifice life and limb to get to the rim. The savior scoring role on a roster built for defense. The ability to get veteran teammates to buy in—fully and eagerly—to everything he was selling. The measured responses to stunning triumphs. The euphoric embrace from his home crowd.Such lofty comparisons are appropriate for Mitchell, who became just the third rookie guard to average 20+ PPG since 1990. The 22-year-old guard kept raising the bar as he led Utah past Oklahoma City in the first round: 28 points in Game 2 to steal homecourt advantage, 33 points in Game 4 to take a 3-1 lead, and then 38 points in Game 6 to send Russell Westbrook packing. While the Rockets were able to dissect the Jazz in round two, Mitchell’s postseason debut made it clear that he’s set up for major success. His next steps—improving as a three-point shooter, getting to the line more frequently, and growing as a facilitator—are refinements rather than quantum leaps. If Rose was Chicago’s first superstar of the post-Jordan era, Mitchell might very well become Utah’s most beloved and decorated player since Stockton and Malone. — BGWhen a Twitter heckler requested that he stay focused on advancing in the playoffs rather than talking trash about the Warriors, McCollum (21.4 PPG, 4 RPG, 3.4 APG) responded by unleashing a plaintive wail that inspired tribute t-shirts: “I’m trying Jennifer.” The viral comeback was doubly honest, as it reflected McCollum’s dedication to his craft and acknowledged Portland’s painful back-to-back first-round sweeps. Indeed, there can be no questioning the 2016 Most Improved Player’s commitment: McCollum has missed just five total games over the past three seasons, he’s forged a successful and non-combative star partnership with Damian Lillard, and he was a rare bright spot for the Blazers in the 2018 playoffs.In many ways, McCollum, 26, has developed into an ideal No. 2 scoring option: he can create a shot, he can run the offense for a bench-heavy lineup, he can attack mismatches, he can shoot the three, he can draw attention when he’s off the ball, and he has a good feel for when to defer versus when to take over. Despite this, Portland’s hard ceiling has led observers to wonder whether he would be better suited to running his own team or whether Lillard would be better off paired with a bigger, longer and more defensive-minded partner. Here’s a more compelling hypothetical: How far could Lillard and McCollum go together if GM Neil Olshey ever gave them a league-average supporting cast? Chances are, the Jennifers of the world would need to find new material. — BGBefore you hold Charlotte’s poor performance against Walker, note that the Hornets were actually a winning team whenever he was on the floor. In those minutes, Charlotte outscored their opponents by 3.5 points per 100 possessions, according to NBA.com—a comparable margin to that of the 55-27 Celtics. Walker (22.1 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 5.6 APG) was a star in all matters he could actually control. Holding him accountable for a disastrous backup point guard rotation would be akin to blaming him for concession prices or parking availability.If anything, Walker had a valiant year. His play was the saving grace of an undermanned roster, which he led without making a fuss. Even when he was featured in trade rumors of the team owner’s own making, Walker went out of his way to express loyalty to the city and organization that brought him into the NBA. When he had every right to be frustrated, Walker just went to work.It’s easy to play for a teammate like that. Walker digs in, as is evident through his continued self-improvement. The subtle refinement of his off-the-dribble game has made Walker a better creator and the transformation of his jumper has made him a bigger threat; together, that combination has cinched his reputation as one of the most prolific pull-up jumpshooters in the league. Walker created about as many unassisted threes last season as anyone not named James Harden. Opponents, now wise to this, are tempted to overreact. The more dangerous Walker becomes, the better the opportunities for his teammates that result. It’s only the most obvious way that Walker makes the players around him better. — RMLet’s establish, first, what Love (17.6 PPG, 9.3 RPG) is not. Love is not a helpful defender. One stop—no matter how crucial—doesn’t overwrite hours of film in which Love has been targeted and exploited. Love is not a primary scorer for a playoff-caliber team. The memory of Minnesota Love isn’t just five years old, but a relic of a different time altogether. Even if he could tap back into that version of himself, today’s defenses are better schooled in tracking Princeton-style movement and more aware of Love’s limitations. Love, though, is not just a role player. The cost of playing alongside LeBron James is the reduction of your game to its most basic elements. That got the Cavs to four straight Finals but reduced Love to a standstill shooter in the process.Love can make that work (he rated as one of the most efficient spot-up shooters in the league last season, per Synergy Sports), but not only that. The great casualty of his move to Cleveland was the opportunity to make plays. When the Cavs put the ball in Love’s hands, they did so with the intention that he get buckets rather than run offense. It’s an important distinction. Love doesn’t really have the handle or the post game to manufacture shots on command. But letting him read the action for an offense that actually moves could work to the benefit of all involved. Love, even through the simplest implementation, is a star who can create real problems for opposing bigs. The only question is how far his team wants to go to maximize what he does best. — RM DeRozan (23.0 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 5.2 APG) made an earnest effort to reformat his game last season that, in the end, didn’t mean much. Encouraging as it was for DeRozan to venture beyond the arc in the regular season, he bailed on the notion of even attempting a three-pointer in the playoffs—after missing 13 straight. The free-flowing style of the Raptor offense encouraged DeRozan to move the ball until it didn’t; once the system clammed up in the second round, so, too, did DeRozan’s passing. There is more to DeRozan than how he performed against LeBron James and the Cavs. That said, the end of that series (also the end of DeRozan’s Raptors career) was especially vivid: a Game 3 benching followed by a Game 4 ejection, giving way to a sweep, a trade, and the end of an era.The lesson of the Raptors is that a franchise could easily build a playoff team around DeRozan. It’s building a championship team that’s the trouble—in part because a seven-game series airs out DeRozan’s every liability. In that setting, his defense becomes catastrophic, as was the case against the Cavs. Free throws are harder to come by. The same moves that worked for DeRozan throughout the regular season become tougher to pull off against carefully tailored defenses. And when his scoring game stalls, DeRozan—who doesn’t really cut and doesn’t trust his own three-point shooting—has no real way to contribute.I say all this only to illustrate the differences between the two DeMars. One is a rock: a steadying influence through a long regular season. The other is not, until he proves otherwise.  — RMIt would come as no surprise if Damian Lillard still jolts awake in the dead of night, the memory of Holiday’s playoff defense still fresh in his mind. There are defenders who try hard, who play smart, and who put on a good show. Holiday (19.0 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.0 APG) cuts straight through everything to deny a scorer that which he holds dear. It doesn’t take him long to figure out where his opponent wants the ball, and once he does, he shuts down most every lifeline leading there.Holiday is one of the NBA’s best defensive players. The usual limitations regarding point guards don’t really apply; he’s tall (a listed 6’4”), he’s long (his wingspan, at the time of his drafting, was measured at 6’7”), and he’s too strong to be pushed around. That gave New Orleans the flexibility to move Holiday between perimeter assignments as needed. Against the Warriors, for example, Holiday was the Pelicans’ best shot at defending Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.It’s a wonder where he finds the energy. Holiday works a double shift under a huge minutes load: first as a defensive stopper, then as one of the leaders of an offense. New Orleans brought in another point guard (Rajon Rondo) to help Holiday manage, though functionally his role wasn’t all that different; New Orleans was still at its best when Holiday was able to direct traffic, and his production held regardless of whether Rondo was on the floor with him. Holiday is a universal complement. Play him at either guard spot and in almost any capacity. His game knows no bad fit. — RMAfter a hamstring injury cost him most of the 2016-17 season, Middleton (20.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.0 APG) bounced back better than even his most optimistic supporters could have hoped. The versatile 27-year-old wing posted career-highs in scoring, rebounds, assists, PER, True Shooting % and Win Shares while playing all 82 games and logging nearly 3,000 minutes. Milwaukee’s season saw all sorts of ups and downs, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo/Middleton pairing was reliable and successful throughout. The duo crested during a first-round series against Boston, when Antetokounmpo left Brad Stevens shaking his head with multiple 30-point games and a scorching-hot Middleton posted a playoff-best 71.9 TS%.Middleton, much like Paul George, is ideally suited to a No. 2 role, and his completely transferrable game could complement everyone from Antetokounmpo to James Harden to Anthony Davis. Offensively, he can shoot the three, create a shot, and generate high-percentage scoring opportunities by beating help defense with the pass. Defensively, he can switch seamlessly through multiple positions and handle lead assignments thanks to his quickness and length. The Bucks’ next step under new coach Mike Budenholzer is clear: Construct a five-man offensive system that reduces the need for Antetokounmpo and Middleton to grind out isolation half-court buckets. With a little more structural help and a little less one-on-one, the understated Middleton might finally achieve the recognition and postseason success that has long eluded him. — BGThis was a stretch season for Beal (22.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 4.5 APG), who not only played all 82 games for the first time in his career but went half that time without John Wall. The experience was illuminating. We saw Beal run even more pick-and-roll than usual, approaching each with a new disposition. Taking over the responsibility for an offense can’t help but change a player. Even though Beal will always see the game as a scorer first, he was more patient when it came to reading the floor and letting his options develop. The lesson, contrary to the extreme reaction at the time, was not that the Wizards are better off without Wall. It was that the Wizards are better off without Wall dominating the offense, which Beal could do more to help orchestrate.Every year, Beal’s handle gets a little tighter. His crossovers these days aren’t quite so unruly, which allows him to work in straighter lines. The more direct Beal’s game is, the better; he’s so good at slamming on the brakes—only to pull-up for a jumper or pivot into one—that any momentum he generates works to his advantage. Beal’s touch is natural, but his moves are earned. You can see the patterns in his footwork that would only materialize through repetition, as he sorts out how to attack out of any situation and at any angle. Maybe the most underrated part of Beal’s game is the sheer accessibility of his scoring. No matter where he’s positioned, there’s always a way through. — RMAlthough Simmons (15.8 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 8.2 APG) is only 22 years old, he has already provided convincing answers to most of the pre-draft questions that surfaced in 2016. He’s not a point guard? Simmons was the lead ball-handler for one of the league’s most devastating five-man lineups, claiming 2018 Rookie of the Year honors and joining John Wall as the only rookies to average 15+ PPG and 8+ APG during the last 20 years. He has a questionable motor? Simmons came out of the gate as a clear plus defender—ranking 35th league-wide in Real Plus-Minus—while also carrying Philadelphia to eight straight wins without Joel Embiid to close the season. He won’t be able to bully his way to the hoop against NBA-caliber defenders like he did in college and high school? Simmons’s shot distribution chart looks like it belongs to an elite center, as he hit 74.4% of his shots in the basket area and took nearly half of his attempts from within three feet.There was, of course, one knock that did stick: his total lack of shooting. Despite playing more than 2,700 minutes, Simmons attempted just 11 three-pointers and didn’t make any. Among established star-level perimeter players, there really isn’t a modern comparison for that degree of perimeter futility, although John Wall, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and DeMar DeRozan all struggled mightily early in their careers. Philadelphia’s second-round series loss to Boston proved that Simmons can’t always work around his Achilles heel. Without a jumper to extend the defense, the Australian point forward was held in check, stymied by the Celtics’ interior bodies and forced into more turnovers than the Sixers could stomach. Yet focusing only on his uneven play against Boston would be misrepresentative of a spectacular rookie season: Simmons is one of the NBA’s brightest young lights, and he appears poised to make his All-Star Game debut in 2019. — BGThis ranking takes a relatively conservative view on Hayward, who suffered gruesome, compounding leg injuries five minutes into his first game of the 2017-18 season. Should Hayward look just as good as he did before those injuries (or better), a spot in the top 20 could be entirely reasonable. It just can’t be guaranteed—not after Hayward was immobilized, reduced to shooting from a chair, and categorically ruled out even as the Celtics played late into May. A full, uncomplicated recovery can’t always be taken on faith.What’s more certain is Hayward’s skill level. It’s probably for the best if he isn’t his team’s leading scorer, though all other options are on the table. His game is deeply agreeable. More fluid systems could lean on Hayward to read his surroundings and make plays, while a more scripted offense could fall back on his ability to cut and curl. Hayward has made himself into the kind of wing who can consistently hit difficult shots; years of working off the ball have led him to make the most of tight windows, while a stronger frame helps to absorb contact in the middle of a runner or jumper.He’ll be great for the Celtics because he’d be great pretty much anywhere. Two-way wings create possibilities. They don’t necessitate playing any certain way, but they make it easier to adapt—particularly when, like Hayward, they can guard well across three positions. There isn’t an offense Hayward can’t better or a defense he can’t execute. His game is all options. — RMAs always, Wall (19.4 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 9.6 APG) has paid careful attention to the perception of his standing relative to his peers, noting in an August interview with NBA Sports Washington that “a lot of guys don’t talk about me being a top-five point guard.” Although SI.com ranked Wall as the fifth-best point guard and 13th overall player at this time last year, it’s impossible to argue that he lived up to that billing. The five-time All-Star missed half the season due to injury, ranked outside the top 45 by PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP, and was quickly bounced in the first round of the playoffs. At 28, Wall has never led a 50-win team, he’s led just one top-10 offense, and he’s won just three total playoff series during his eight-year career. That body of work doesn’t compare—at all—to the likes of Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook.If Wall returns to full health and 20/10 production, he belongs in the mix for a top-five spot with the next tier of point guards: Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving and Kyle Lowry. But regaining his footing in that conversation requires more than just flashing his incredible athleticism, maintaining his improved three-point percentage, and recommitting himself on the defensive end. Wall spent a good portion of last year sniping with Marcin Gortat, and his ball-dominant approach briefly led critics to wonder if Washington was better off without him when he was injured. If Wall can make meaningful strides as an inclusive and empowering leader both on and off the court, the Wizards are far more likely to reach their playoff ceiling. When that happens, he won’t need to waste his time and energy fighting for respect. He’ll get his due. — BGKudos to Lowry (16.2 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 6.9 APG), the sole remaining survivor in Toronto’s triumvirate of blame. With Dwane Casey and DeMar DeRozan both gone following another humiliating loss to LeBron James, it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what the coach and his star guards accomplished together: five straight seasons with 48+ wins, the five winningest seasons in franchise history, five playoff appearances, four playoff series victories, and a trip to the East finals. During Lowry’s six-year tenure in Toronto, the Raptors have won 297 games, the most of any Eastern Conference team. Now, at age 32, Lowry will plunge forward with a rookie coach and a rehabilitated Kawhi Leonard in search of his first trip to the Finals.Although Lowry’s individual numbers diminished last season, the fall-off was mostly attributable to a more careful management of his minutes rather than a dramatic change in his ability. The four-time All-Star logged five fewer minutes per game during the regular season, a substantial strategic adjustment that helped him play 78 games and turn in easily the most efficient postseason of his career. While Lowry remains a strong outside shooter and a dynamic all-around offensive player, his age might be starting to show on the other end. He led the league with 37 drawn charges in 2017-18, but his impact stats weren’t quite as impressive as in recent years. This much is clear: No one benefits more from Leonard’s arrival than Lowry, who gets to move to a shotgun role alongside an MVP-level champion at the exact moment his own window as an elite point guard was starting to close. — BGPondering Thompson (20 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 2.5 APG) in a vacuum is a far more enriching mental exercise than assessing his play with the Warriors because he is the definition of a known quantity. The 28-year-old sharpshooter has produced nearly identical numbers for four straight seasons now, ranking among the NBA’s deadliest three-point marksmen and its most respected perimeter defenders.Although a fluky thumb injury caused him to miss a career-high nine games in 2017-18, Thompson was as lethal as ever during the postseason run to Golden State’s third title in four years. His personal highlight: draining nine three-pointers in a do-or-die Game 6 in the West finals, a season-saving explosion that mirrored his epic Game 6 against the Thunder two years earlier.When listing off the reasons that the Warriors are “unfair,” don’t forget that their third option is a stone-cold sniper with a quick trigger who also happens to love grinding out defensive possessions against star wings.Place Thompson on a team with average talent and a need for him to play a leading role, and there’s no telling exactly how things would turn out. His limitations as an off-the-dribble creator and a playmaker for others would show through quickly, and his efficiency would surely dip with lower-percentage looks. How hard would he need to work to get open without Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant? Would his occasional streakiness be held against him more often if he was the No. 1 option? Would his pressure defense be held in the same regard if Draymond Green wasn’t behind him to play clean up? These are intriguing questions, but they will remain hypotheticals for the foreseeable future thanks to Thompson’s willingness to sacrifice in Ginobili-like fashion. Here in reality, he’s bound to keep swishing threes and stacking rings in his perfect role with the champs. — BGAldridge (23.1 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 2.0 APG) returns after a genuinely remarkable season, in which he reconciled with the Spurs, staved off decline, and played every bit to an All-NBA standard. San Antonio’s offense was solvent solely because of him. All the ball movement was cute, but 20 seconds of good intentions often ended in Aldridge bailing his teammates out. A lack of shooting in the lineup left Aldridge the space of a broom closet. He responded with arguably his best season to date, anchoring a 47-win team in the process.It’s less than ideal to rely on Aldridge in that way, but—as the Spurs proved—it’s really not the worst thing in the world. When he’s comfortable, Aldridge is tough to deny. His usual array of shots is easily manufactured, even in the face of attentive defense. Those opponents who can cause problems for Aldridge’s face-up game won’t generally have much impact on his back-to-the-basket play. There’s only so much that can be done to challenge the release of a 6’11” shooter from all angles.Some regression could be in order. Aldridge wasn’t unusually accurate from any range last season in a way that would raise alarm, but he is a 33-year-old with more than a decade of star-level usage. That hurts his case in a top-25 field that is otherwise quite young—full of players either in the thick of their primes or with their best years still to come. Aldridge is on the other side. The question is not whether his numbers hold but for how long. — RMBefore last season, Oladipo (23.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.3 APG) barely needed a trophy case: the 2013 No. 2 pick’s unspectacular career was highlighted by a second-place finish in the 2015 Slam Dunk Contest, an $84 million extension that many observers felt was too generous, and a front-row seat for Russell Westbrook shooting 34 times in an elimination-game defeat. Now? Oladipo has enough hardware to start a personal shrine after earning Most Improved Player, All-Star, All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive First Team honors in one of the great mid-career breakouts in recent memory.The 26-year-old scoring guard displayed numerous improvements following a trade from Oklahoma City to Indiana: he shot the three at a career-high rate, he worked in a more reliable off-the-dribble jumper, he attacked the rim with greater purpose, and he committed to becoming a disruptive defender on a nightly basis. Importantly, Oladipo also settled in as a late-game option, ranking fourth in clutch scoring and leading the pesky, overachieving Pacers to a 24-17 record in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Perhaps the best way to gauge Oladipo’s value came when he was sidelined for seven games: Indiana went 0-7 and lost by an average of 14 points. The East’s No. 5 seed could have been mistaken for the Suns or Grizzlies without its franchise player. This ranking reflects a degree of skepticism that Oladipo’s sensational season—he ranked sixth in Real Plus-Minus, 11th in WARP and 19th in PER—is his new normal. However, his explosiveness, buy-in, and two-way impact should keep him in the All-Star conversation, even if he sustains natural regression or falters a bit under enhanced expectations. — BGTowns (21.3 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 2.4 APG) has every tool at his disposal, every advantage one could hope for. If only he had full command of them. Scoring comes easy; Towns is one of the few genuinely dominant post players left, though in his spare time he moonlights as a 42.1% three-point shooter and one of the quickest-driving centers in the league. It’s the combination of those skills that makes Towns’s occasional disappearances—as in the first few games of Minnesota’s lone playoff series—all the more mystifying. In those moments, he looked every bit a 22-year-old.For as much as Towns can do, there’s still a lot he hasn’t quite figured out. Defense seems to elude him—an issue made all the more glaring by his position. When a young guard takes a bad angle or gives up on a play, there are multiple levels of defensive infrastructure to bail him out. Not so for centers, who are asked to make split-second decisions and cover tons of ground with no safety net. Mastering the rhythms of team defense is as difficult as any part of NBA life. Towns, though, is still striving for competence.He’ll get there. In the meantime, the Wolves will have to settle for his unbelievable efficiency, his strong rebounding, and his matchup-detonating versatility. The thrill with Towns is knowing that this is only the beginning. If some part of his game hasn’t quite crystallized, check back in a few months. — RMJokic (18.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 6.1 APG) has the Midas touch, where every pass that leaves his hand fosters some golden opportunity. He’ll find a cutter well beyond the bounds of typical offense. A shooter will have a cross-court pass from Jokic drop straight into his shooting pocket, synced perfectly to an opponent’s rotation. The degree to which Jokic makes his teammates better is genuinely staggering. If you can shoot or move or score at all, his vision will all but guarantee a career year. Hell, Denver’s equipment manager probably goes on to have a productive day whenever Jokic hands over his jersey for laundry or his shoes for storage. It’s uncanny.That rising tide reflects especially well on Jokic for the purposes of this exercise. If we assume that every player on our list is surrounded by fairly average teammates as a sort of vacuum test, Jokic is among the most likely to elevate them. A middling role player will rarely look so good as when Jokic is force-feeding them points. This was a key point of separation between Jokic and Karl-Anthony Towns in the determination of their rankings. Both rebound well, space the floor, and score at similar rates. Neither is much of a defender. Jokic, though, averaged more assists per game than any other center in the three-point era, and has the receipts to prove his passing’s effect. One could easily prefer Towns as a matter of taste, though Jokic might do slightly more for an offense at this point in their careers. — RMIrving (24.4 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.1 APG) spent his first season with the Celtics in effortless synchronicity, right up until the deflating moment that knee complications brought it to a premature end. The five-time All-Star point guard was quick on the ball, flirting with the first 50/40/90 season of his career and thriving in space as the lead playmaker in a well-balanced attack. He was quick as a professional, landing himself on a premier franchise and a budding superteam after foreseeing Cleveland’s demise and the shifting tides in the East. And he was quick to dispel numerous criticisms that had built up during his Cavaliers tenure. Throughout a brilliant 16-game winning streak, Irving proved that he could thrive as an alpha rather than as a sidekick, that he could balance his scoring and distributing without rubbing his co-stars the wrong way, that he could be the major personality on a winning team despite his quirks, and that he could play big minutes on an elite defense.Unfortunately, the 26-year-old Irving’s substantial personal progress, a postseason date with former teammate LeBron James, and a likely trip to the Finals all went poof when he was lost for the season in mid-March. Irving has now missed 21% of his team’s regular-season games during his seven-year career, and another injury this season would complicate his 2019 free agency. As the former No. 1 pick progresses through his prime, health clearly represents the last major hurdle separating him from an annual spot on the All-NBA teams and a consensus “Top 10” reputation. —BGHorford (12.9 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 4.7 APG) is a patron saint of the Top 100, in that he embodies so many of the attributes we tend to value highly. He plays both sides of the ball without condition, and in a way that makes everyone around him better. His game is both reliable enough to anchor a team and versatile enough to allow for changes on the fly. He fits the modern game. Nothing in Horford’s style or skill set would make him a target in a playoff series. If anything, his incredible basketball literacy would poke holes in an opponent’s game plan in real time. The way he plays upholds a standard and the way he carries himself can establish a culture. Horford exudes a winning effect. He was one of the most important players in the entire league last season, and this ranking reflects that.At the same time, evaluating the future of any 32-year-old deserves some caution—as does isolating the value of any one, particular Celtic. Horford could be at his absolute best in Boston, if only because the organization seems to value him fully. Yet even if he were playing with lesser teammates for a lesser coach, Horford would invariably raise the level of execution. He’s too smart not to. If his influence didn’t bear out through his own individual defense, it would in the way he directs traffic. Even if he wasn’t in a position to make plays, Horford would intuitively screen or space the floor for others.From an impact perspective, Horford is only a few degrees removed from Draymond Green. Both rank among the league’s best defensive players (Horford, for what it’s worth, led the top defense overall) and augment high-functioning offenses with their playmaking. And each, in his own way, has made himself completely indispensable to one of the best teams in the league. The Celtics were forced to do without their two biggest stars last season. They marched all the way to the Eastern Conference finals regardless—because their most valuable player was still in uniform. — RMAfter years of griping about his All-Star snubs, Lillard (26.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.6 APG) backed into a far better honor: The 2018 All-NBA First Team. For once, the murky voting criteria—stats, winning, name recognition, narrative—coalesced in his favor. The 28-year-old point guard was healthier than Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Jimmy Butler, and his Blazers were steadier and more functional than Russell Westbrook’s Thunder. His statistical portfolio was impeccable: He ranked top five in scoring, top 10 in clutch points, top 10 in PER, Win Shares and WARP, and top 15 in Real Plus-Minus. And Lillard had a compelling story too: He was a highly-respected offensive weapon, an improved defender, and the unquestioned leader of an overachieving No. 3 seed.By the time Lillard’s well-deserved moment in the sun was announced in May, Portland was smarting from an embarrassing first-round sweep against New Orleans. Although that series exposed Lillard’s struggles in the face of a physical trapping defense, it was a more damning indictment of his weak supporting cast.Kyrie Irving might be a better and more exciting ball-handler than Lillard, but he’s had consistent health problems and likely wouldn’t fare much better when surrounded by lineups with two or three holes. Kyle Lowry might be more imposing and experienced than Lillard, but he’s had his own postseason struggles despite much deeper rosters around him. John Wall might be faster and more explosive than Lillard, but his shot selection and questionable leadership are unavoidable concerns. In this tier of imperfect star point guards, Lillard seems to possess the most dependable strengths and the most manageable flaws. — BGGobert (13.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 2.3 BPG) is so imposing that he actually changes the psychology of a game. Opponents with the ball in hand turn their focus inward; you can see confident players talk themselves out of shots they would ordinarily love to take, all for fear of Gobert swatting them away. Many teams will go to amazing lengths to pull Gobert away from the basket—challenging him laterally rather than vertically—but there’s only so much you can do to separate from a 7’1” shot-blocker with Gobert’s instincts. An incredible number of plays will always be in his reach.His presence provides a sense of order, a way of life. Utah orients its entire defense around Gobert, knowing that he’ll not only influence a ton of shots himself, but give teammates license to apply their own pressure. This has a constricting effect. Passing lanes are tighter. Driving lanes are contested. It’s difficult to even work through your offense against Gobert and the Jazz, much less score. Defenders are emboldened at every turn, channeling Gobert’s confidence. Gobert plays with the sureness of a player who knows exactly what he is. There are no misconceptions to his game—no indulgent post-ups or rash dribble moves. Just no-frills, highly efficient offense predicated on putting as little space between him and the rim as possible. Cutting off his access to the basket is easier said than done; even last season’s Rockets, who switched as capably as any team in the league, couldn’t entirely deny Gobert’s rolls, cuts, and put-backs. There are some things you can never take away from a seven-footer when he’s wholly committed to playing his game. — RM“There are 82-game players, then there are 16-game players.” The Athletic reported that bit of wisdom was delivered by Green (11 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 7.3 APG) to Golden State’s front office as draft advice, but the distinction helps explain the versatile power forward’s evolution as he continues through his prime. Now, more than ever, the 28-year-old Green is a 16-game player: a dynamic defensive mastermind who saves his best work for the playoffs.During the Warriors’ third title run, Green played a key role in defending LaMarcus Aldridge and Anthony Davis while offering constant help on the likes of James Harden, Chris Paul and LeBron James. He led Golden State in minutes, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals during the playoffs. His absurd 99.5 defensive rating was a major reason the champs skated through Stephen Curry’s absence, survived Kevin Durant’s choppy stretches in the West finals, and swept James out of Cleveland in the Finals. And despite being listed at 6’7”, Green led the NBA by defending 158 shots from within six feet during the playoffs. He allowed just 54.4% on those shots, a postseason rim-protection rate that’s comparable to long-armed shot-blockers like Davis and Clint Capela.Green’s offensive utility has slipped slightly over the last two years: his three-point shooting has regressed, and his pick-and-roll playmaking has taken a backseat to accommodate Durant’s arrival. Regardless, he’s a skilled and willing passer who would be able to function as a quality secondary playmaker even if he wasn’t surrounded by All-Stars on all sides. The eye test and his impact stats agree that Green has learned to dial back his effort level in the regular season, and that’s a luxury he wouldn’t have on most teams. Then again, Green’s postseason prowess and leadership during big moments are major reasons why Golden State can get away with coasting in the first place. — BGLeonard (16.2 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.3 APG) ranked fourth on last year’s SI.com Top 100 because he possesses so many of the qualities this list aims to celebrate and appreciate: he boasts a complete and refined game, his presence makes his team better on both ends, his scoring game is multi-dimensional and efficient, he’s a premier perimeter defender, he’s a proven playoff performer, he’s painstakingly worked to eliminate his weaknesses, and his game would easily mesh with any cast of teammates. Leonard is a perennial MVP candidate, he’s the best player in Raptors history even though he hasn’t played a game yet, and he would be the best teammate LeBron James has ever had if he joins the Lakers next summer. In short, he was a 20+ points per game scorer and very nearly a 50/40/90 shooter in the same year he won 2016 Defensive Player of the Year. That is the definition of immense value on the hardwood.Clearly, there’s a major “but…” coming now. But, at this moment in his career, Leonard finds himself needing to reestablish a quality that is essential to leadership and winning: reliability. This is a question of both health and demeanor. After playing just nine games last season, the 27-year-old Leonard has now missed 27% of his team’s regular-season games during his career. To make matters worse, he behaved in reprehensible fashion for a max-level franchise player throughout his injury absence, drawing soft rebukes and subliminal digs from his legendary coach and teammates. Regardless of what happened behind closed doors or on the training table, Leonard is solely responsible for months of poor communication, for his ill-fated “Spur for life” press conference, and for the distracting “Uncle Dennis” chatter. He’s solely responsible for leaving his teammates up in the air about his availability in the run-up to the playoffs and for staying away from the Spurs during the postseason. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Anthony Davis would never behave like Leonard did because they understand and accept that being an A-list superstar requires comporting oneself like a chief executive.While James’s move to L.A. will garner 1,000 times more attention, Leonard’s arrival in Toronto is nearly as intriguing and arguably more influential on the 2019 title picture. Will Leonard take James’s place as the East’s best player and lead the Raptors to the Finals after so many postseason heartbreaks? Or, will Leonard’s silence and loud free-agency rumors doom Toronto like they did San Antonio? How will he adjust to life under a rookie head coach after seven years with Gregg Popovich? Will a potential Hall of Fame career that launched with such promise—a Finals MVP at age 22—get back on track or derail further? — BGGeorge (21.9 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 3.3 APG) is a great shooter in a league that runs on shooting, a choice defender for some of the most difficult matchups, and a flexible star at a time when amassing talent is the only real way to compete. Indiana gave George the opportunity to lead a team of his own, which only led him to relish a day he didn’t have to. He is a star built for these times—both fully capable of taking a team over the top and fully aware of how much help it takes to win.Playing in Oklahoma City works for him. George does his best work when he doesn’t have to handle the ball on every possession, which is never really a problem with Russell Westbrook around. Both operate in ways that make the other’s job easier: Westbrook’s shot creation is a relief to George, who can do more of his work off the ball. Meanwhile, George is enough of a draw that a defense can’t just load up against Westbrook’s drives. One pushes, the other pulls.In truth, George could have that kind of basketball relationship with any number of stars around the league. Good fits come naturally when a scorer of George’s caliber doubles as an elite spot-up shooter. All sorts of lineups make sense when George can defend the best player across three positions. Any rotation can work when you know that George, who is perennially among the league leaders in minutes played, can handle a massive workload. If anything, George made the balance of playing between Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony look easier than it was. George’s greatest talent—among many—may be how easily he covers up the seams. — RMNew conference, new organization, new teammates, same Butler (22.2 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.9 APG). A stunning 2017 Draft-day trade to Minnesota placed the relentless 28-year-old wing in the savior role for a franchise that hadn’t made the postseason since 2004. He promptly delivered on the playoff mandate, earning his fourth All-Star selection in addition to All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive Second Team honors. In terms of measurable impact, few superstars have rivaled Butler in recent years: he ranked fourth in Real Plus-Minus, he played a leading role in lifting Minnesota’s offensive rating to fourth in the NBA, his presence on the court swung Minnesota’s net rating by a whopping 12.8 points, and his team nearly fell to pieces when he missed more than a month with a late-season knee injury.Butler, like Russell Westbrook, predicates his game on force of will. When he arrived in Minnesota, there was hope that he would pair with Andrew Wiggins to form one of the league’s top perimeter duos. Instead, the two wings emerged in sharp contrast: If Wiggins’s empty minutes were a watery broth, Butler’s were a chunky stew. Butler seeks out the heavy lifting, whether it’s drawing contact to force his way to the foul line, hawking the opposition’s best player, or taking control of the offense late in close games. His methods work—to a point.  With Butler on the court, the Timberwolves were tracking to the West’s No. 3 seed, going 37-22 (a 51-win clip). Without him, they went 10-13 (a 36-win pace) and certainly would have been lottery-bound.But turning over a franchise to Butler is a bargain with strings attached. His all-gas, no-brakes style of play has caused him to miss an average of 15 games over the past five years, and his biting impatience with his teammates has generated problematic headlines in Chicago and Minnesota. The former role player has completely rewired himself as an alpha scorer since his breakout 2014-15 season, but there are real questions about how far he can carry a team in the playoffs. Butler has advanced in the postseason just once since rising to stardom, and he will need to make it through the regular season unscathed from a health standpoint if he wants to win a series in the West.Comparing Butler and Paul George is annually one of this list’s toughest calls, given their quality two-way games and similar accomplishments. While Butler is a more effective No. 1 option thanks to his punishing style and playmaking ability, George is the superior outside shooter, fits more cleanly alongside star players as an elite No. 2, and has enjoyed better health. Ultimately, the quality of Butler’s minutes won out: he beat out George in PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP while playing a more central role in his team’s success. If Butler’s injury issues resurface, though, he will be headed for a tumble in next year’s rankings. — BGIt’s rare to see a player already in the running for Defensive Player of the Year developing at such a rapid rate. Embiid (22.9 PPG, 11.0 RPG, 3.2 APG) is a sponge. The nuances of professional play are still so new to him, yet instinct guides Embiid to positions of particular impact. He has a natural aptitude for rotation, which involves reading the floor and timing out plays as they progress. Opponents are terrified of him, which buys Embiid time; players take such a wide berth around him and use so many pump fakes that Embiid has a longer window than most to get where he needs to go. Even at this stage, he all but guarantees an elite defense. Imagine how good Embiid could be when he actually knows what he’s doing.It’s that trajectory that makes Embiid, who stands to improve more than any other player in our Top 10, so difficult to rank. Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo could add to their games, but not so much as a center with limited experienced in organized basketball set to play his third NBA season. There are still noticeable hitches in Embiid’s game that could be ironed out, from the way he deals with double teams to his gutsy shot selection  his carelessness with the ball. Embiid is a thoroughly dominant work in progress, which should come as a terrifying prospect to the rest of the league. There are few players capable of credibly guarding Embiid as it is. Things could really take a turn as his play elevates; we’re not far from Eastern Conference contenders stocking some big-bodied “Embiid stopper” by necessity.The caveat to all this, of course, is Embiid’s health. We have yet to see him play more than 63 games in a season, which came in what was easily Embiid’s healthiest campaign to date. It helps his case that so many other top players (Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, and Jimmy Butler, in particular) tend to miss between 15 and 20 games on average. Their own injury histories work as an equalizer. There’s more worry with Embiid because of his size and the chronic nature of his injuries, but this lists forecasts for a single season based off the healthiest Embiid has ever been. Allow, at least, for the possibility that the Sixers can be cautious with Embiid and still have him in uniform for around 65 games. — RMThe implicit framing of the Top 100 is this: Who are the players who really matter in the games that matter most? Paul (18.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 7.9 APG) jumps near the top of the list—not because he happens to play for one of the best teams in the league, but because he’s exactly the kind of player you want involved when your season is on the line. Houston knows this well, having built a 3-2 series lead against the Warriors thanks to Paul’s gutsy play and then having dropped the last two games of the series in his absence. On the one hand, Paul’s tendency to pick up injuries clearly works against him. On the other, Paul is still operating at such an incredible level that some missed time is tolerable. You make do when a player is operating this close to an MVP level, even if he misses 24 games along the way.Paul earns this standing with the way he picks apart opponents. What a miserable thing it must be to step up, as a big man, against one of Paul’s pick-and-rolls. React to any of Paul’s feints and he’ll rock back into an easy mid-range jumper. Try to play it cool and he’ll drive past you, winding around the court in search of any vulnerability. Paul is such a high-level passer and defender that his one-on-one brilliance somehow went unnoticed. No more. Houston’s offense reached its historic heights in part because Paul can almost always get his, a genuine rarity among guards his size. Even though he plays alongside another great passer in James Harden, only 15% of Paul’s field goals last season were assisted.It was because of that creative strength that the Rockets could stagger the minutes of their two best players, overwhelming opponents with 48 minutes of offensive pressure. Paul’s approach is quite different than Harden’s, but he runs similar lineups to great effect. For one, he scored as much on a per-minute basis as at any point in his career—even while barely getting to the rim or the free throw line. More important is that Paul always seems to know which levers to pull for the best possible result. Houston’s system relies on Paul ability to generate offense for himself, but he’s always at his most comfortable orchestrating for others—guiding his teammates into scoring positions and mismatches that best fit the moment.There’s no real substitute for that level of situational awareness, which enables Paul to function effectively in any lineup and in any style. There is no matchup on earth that could play him off the court, or even make him a mark. Target Paul at your own risk. This is a guard who can hang with Kevin Durant on the block in a pinch, and who can go shimmy for shimmy with Steph Curry. No matter the challenge, Paul is game to compete. — RMNote: Westbrook’s rank was determined before the announcement of his most recent knee surgery. Say what you will about Westbrook, but the man shows up. When his team’s season is on the brink, Westbrook will take every damn shot necessary to keep things afloat. While other players awkwardly feel out the dynamic of a playoff series, Westbrook charges in, forcing everyone on the court to respond to him. It’s almost incomprehensible that someone who drives as hard as Westbrook could be as healthy as he’s been prior to undergoing knee surgery this week. Durability is a skill in itself, and Westbrook—even as his legend grows—doesn’t get nearly enough credit for his availability in the wake of hard fouls, harder falls, and freaking dents in the side of his face.Simply employing Westbrook gives a team an unquestionable identity. No superstar in the league brings such consistent effort; although there are plenty of faults to find in Westbrook’s approach, you could never accuse him of coasting. Teammates tend to follow suit, giving the entire outfit a relentless, combative style. If you’re not ready to play, Westbrook will run you off the court. It’s perfectly understandable why some stars would pace themselves for the playoffs, though there’s value in a player like Westbrook bringing force to every game of the regular season.There remains some debate, however, as to what far-reaching effects Westbrook’s style might have on a roster. For any one player to dominate so many of his team’s possessions must come at a cost. Westbrook is similar to LeBron in that way. Playing alongside either can be a great gig for a specialist. The more narrow your game, the more Westbrook can do for you. Dynamic players, however, don’t always have the easiest time fitting in. Westbrook takes up so much oxygen that he makes it hard for other players to really blossom. It’s not exactly a coincidence that the Thunder never really seem to know how to function without him. Westbrook is such a force of game and personality that he becomes completely integral. If his team struggles without him, it’s in part because he made it that way.The good with Westbrook far outweighs the bad, but with his style comes a certain ceiling. Playoff teams can turn his ferocity against him. Defense still seems like an exhibition to Westbrook, a battle between players rather than teams. Patience—the primary currency of postseason problem solving—isn’t exactly his strong suit. And it’s all because Westbrook, for better or worse, only knows one way to play. — RMIt’s easy to get distracted by Milwaukee's lack of playoff progress or lose sight of the big picture after watching his impossible highlights for three years, so here’s a simple, zoomed-out reminder: Antetokounmpo (26.9 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG) is the best story in basketball. At 18, he was a nobody whose Greek league games were captured only on grainy video. At 19, he was drafted outside the lottery and spent his rookie season looking lost. By 22, he had cracked the All-Star and All-NBA teams and was named Most Improved Player. Now, at 23, Antetokounmpo is a certified global sensation, finishing sixth in 2018 MVP voting, drawing nearly as many All-Star votes as LeBron James, earning a signature shoe deal from Nike, and getting the full feature treatment from 60 Minutes.The longer one marinates on Antetokounmpo’s impossible rise, the more it feels like he’s won the NBA version of Powerball four times in a row. There is one major difference: Antetokounmpo’s extreme good fortune has been supplemented by extreme diligence to his craft. Step by step, Antetokounmpo has built himself into an alpha scorer by honing his ball-handling skills, committing to an attack mentality, living on the free-throw line, learning how to use his length to generate high-quality looks around the basket, and adding strength so that he can finish over and through anyone in the league. Indeed, nearly half of Antetokounmpo’s shot attempts last season came from within three feet, and he finished more than 75% of them. “He’s impossible to guard,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said during the playoffs, with evident admiration and a shake of his head.It’s only going to get worse for Stevens and his fellow coaches. Antetokounmpo’s feel as a playmaker has room to improve, as does Milwaukee’s spacing around him. The Bucks ranked seventh in offense last season, and they have the potential to be a top-three unit during Antetokounmpo’s prime years if they can consistently surround him with four shooters and get him loose in the open court more often. Of course, there’s also the persistent hope that Antetokounmpo can extend his range, which at present includes a passable mid-range game and limited three-point proficiency. Antetokounmpo with a trustworthy jumper would be a whole new flavor of impossible.In both his offensive strengths and limitations, Antetokounmpo somewhat resembles the man behind him on this list, Russell Westbrook. Although the Thunder’s point guard has gaudier individual stats and significantly more playoff success, Antetokounmpo is the more complete player thanks to his defensive impact and versatility. At this point, Westbrook’s massive offensive role comes packaged with major compromises in consistency and discipline on the other end. Not so for Antetokounmpo, who switches comfortably through four positions, competes hard on the defensive glass, and contests shots in the basket area more effectively than many starting centers. The bet here is that Antetokounmpo’s sharp ascent will continue with a 2019 postseason breakthrough, turning what is now a tight debate between him and Westbrook into a much easier call by next September. — BGThere’s a case to be made for Davis (28.1 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.3 APG) as the third- or fourth-best player in the league, and it goes like this: No other player—not LeBron James, not Kevin Durant, not anyone—is so consistently dominant on both sides of the ball. Davis could win Defensive Player of the Year while leading the league in scoring. He could be the captain of a top-five offense, the anchor of a top-five defense, or both. We’re nearing the pantheon days of Davis’s career—the beginning of his entry as an all-time great player, beginning with his MVP candidacy in the season to come.The pushback is largely a matter of respecting accomplishment. Stephen Curry and James Harden not only have all the markers of elite play, but a deeper superstar body of work and the postseason receipts to validate it. You don’t wave off two of the best offensive players in NBA history just because Davis is better than he’s ever been. A certain level of respect is owed—particularly when both Curry and Harden do so much to make their teammates’ lives easier.If there is any slight against Davis, it’s that his position makes it hard for him to touch as many possessions as a player like Curry or Harden. Guards who can initiate offense will always be slightly more accessible. Passing gives both a direct means of influencing a play’s outcome, to say nothing of the gravity they exert idly. Davis doesn’t really have that in his game, and that’s fine; allowing others to handle the ball frees Davis of the responsibility, allowing him to instead use his speed to its greatest advantage. Opposing bigs are at a loss when they’re forced to chase Davis, a 6’10” gazelle, around staggered screens to contest his jumper. You can use Davis in all the ways you’d use a high-scoring wing, save that he also has the face-up game to rule the mid-post and the finishing ability to dominate out of the pick-and-roll. There is very little on a basketball court that Davis can’t do.Part of what makes Davis so widely useful is that his shots are so difficult to contest. There aren’t many players who can meet Davis at the rim and make any kind of difference. When he goes to the block, he can’t be pushed around. Davis is taller and stronger than most of the players who guard him, and he understands how to put space between himself and his defender. How can one even combat that? To guard Davis is, really, to be at his mercy. You could transplant his skill set to any roster in the league and find room for him to thrive. Any coach running any system could build its concepts around Davis. His stardom is situation agnostic, and completely undeniable. — RMThe signature moment of his first MVP campaign came in late-February, when Harden (30.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 8.8 APG) set up one of his trademark step-back threes with a between-the-legs dribble that sent Wesley Johnson to the floor. While the Clippers forward scrambled to collect his limbs like he had just lost a game of “Twister,” Harden paused, relaxed his shoulders, and spun the ball while looking at his latest helpless victim. His body language screamed: “What are you doing down there?” Harden then proceeded to drain the three to complete the most emasculating highlight of the season.Harden has been an All-NBA level player and one of the league’s premier scoring threats for years now, but last season saw the 29-year-old guard at his most diabolical. With a new superstar playmaking partner, shooters on all sides, and an excellent lob finisher in the middle, Harden had everything he needed to carve up defenses with his ultra-efficient diet of threes, free throws and lay-ups. He tortured defenders like Johnson in isolation with his methodical crossovers, alternating between his hop-back jumpers, gliding runners, whizzing crosscourt passes and soft-touch alley-oops.When the dust settled, Harden ranked first in scoring, first in PER, first in Win Shares, first in free throws made, first in three-pointers made, second in Real Plus-Minus, and second in WARP. He led the league with 11 40-point games, four 50-point games and a 60-point game. Meanwhile, his Rockets set a franchise-record with a league-best 65 wins, ranking first in point differential and second in offensive efficiency while missing their first Finals trip since 1995 by one win. That breadth of high-level achievement is only possible when a methodically-constructed machine has years to address its weaker links and fine-tune its output.A full and fair review of the Rockets’ 2018 postseason would note that they breezed through the Timberwolves and Jazz as Harden, who had three 40-point games in the postseason, and Chris Paul took turns wreaking havoc. Additionally, Houston gutted out a pair of tight wins over Golden State in the West finals, with Harden scoring 30 points on the road in Game 4 to right the ship after an ugly blowout.For most observers, though, those accomplishments—which represented clear progress from previous postseason runs—were easily forgotten in the wake of Houston’s disastrous Game 7 collapse. Harden’s critics now had “Houston missed 27 straight threes” to add next to “2-11 in Game 6 against San Antonio” and the other demerits on his uneven postseason résumé.Although their agonizing Game 7 meltdown was impossible to explain, Harden and the Rockets left this season with proof that their approach was good enough to win a title. They pushed the Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant Warriors much harder than any other playoff opponent had over the past two years, and Harden performed with greater ease, stability and effect against Golden State’s defense than he had in the 2015 West finals. LeBron James has a higher basketball IQ and displays greater consistency in the playoffs than Harden, Durant is a more complete two-way player, and Curry is one of the few stars in league history whose individual offense can translate to more efficient team play. Those three aside, Harden has fashioned himself into basketball’s most dangerous weapon. — BGYou know the standards with Curry (26.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 6.1 APG) are well and truly out of control when a 50-40-90 championship season is met with a collective yawn. This is just par for the course when you’re the superstar at the heart of one of the greatest teams of all time, not to mention the very reason for that team’s existence. Kevin Durant would not have come to the Warriors if not for Curry. It was the environment that Curry had helped foster that enticed Durant in the first place, and it was Curry’s willingness to accommodate Durant that sealed the deal. A dynastic team was born because Curry is exceptional even among superstars.When Curry has been on the court during the Steve Kerr era, the Warriors are 244-45 (.844)—a perpetual 69-win pace. That’s four straight years of winning more than players like Harden or Davis ever have, all while the Warriors shuffled through centers, retooled their bench, and dealt with Kerr’s extended absence. Curry isn’t solely responsible for that success, but he is driving it. One can develop a deep appreciation for Curry by watching how the Warriors play without him; there’s too much talent in Golden State for things to turn disastrous, but Curry’s absence reveals all the subtle ways in which he makes championship play look easy. For starters, even a well-drawn offense doesn’t have the same juice without Curry’s involvement. The other Warriors move and screen and pass, but in the end so many of their sets are split cuts and fury, signifying nothing.It’s Curry that takes a good thing and makes it special. Every action that Golden State runs comes with implicit threat of Curry’s three-point shooting. When he doesn’t have the ball in his hands, he’s curling in a way so that he could possibly receive it. Most defenses still don’t know what to do with themselves. You can try to deny him, but Curry is quick to set a screen whenever he feels cornered—a simple action that can immediately throw the defense into disarray. Should any other defender help to contain him, Golden State will reverse course to find the open man as quickly as possible. Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system, but again: it’s the particulars in Curry’s game that make it viable. The entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn’t need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation. — RMDuring the premiere of his new barbershop talk show, LeBron James marveled to Snoop Dogg about the rapper’s uncanny ability to maintain his popularity through reinvention for more than 20 years. That particular skill has eluded Durant (26.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 5.4 APG), James’s biggest on-court rival, even as the 29-year-old Warriors forward has reached the apex of his Hall of Fame career. Branded a snake and a bandwagoner for leaving Oklahoma City to join Golden State in 2016, Durant has struggled to shake those labels despite winning two titles, making two iconic three-pointers in the Finals, and claiming two Finals MVPs.Indeed, the relative ease of Durant’s two Finals victories over James has only hardened the resentment. Instead of receiving the relief and validation that rings usually convey to superstars, Durant can’t seem to escape the “asterisk” talk, Superteam envy, and accusations of sensitivity. He’s tried a little bit of everything—donating millions to charity, appearing in commercials for tech companies, criticizing the president, launching a YouTube channel, speaking candidly in multiple long-form podcast interviews, taking the high road by giving intentionally bland press conferences, forsaking the high road by responding directly to his critics and opponents on Twitter—and yet his image is as polarized as ever.This is all a terrible shame. Durant is playing the best basketball of his career and some of the best basketball the NBA has ever seen. Even as Golden State coasted through a lackluster regular season, Durant performed like an MVP candidate, placing in the top 10 by PER, Win Shares and WARP, nearly shooting 50/40/90 for the NBA’s No. 1 offense, and ranking fifth in blocks while garnering some early-season Defensive Player of the Year buzz. When Stephen Curry was sidelined due to injury, Durant ramped up his offensive initiation and playmaking duties. The results weren’t always pretty, but Golden State scored more than enough when it mattered, going 5-1 without Curry to open the postseason.In the West finals, Durant was cast as the scapegoat for Golden State’s choppy offensive execution, with critics blaming his isolation looks for interrupting Curry’s free-flowing style. This was a truly uncomfortable place to be—stuck between a beloved franchise icon and his adoring fanbase—yet Durant responded with 34 points in a Game 7 road win over Houston. The opportunity to get defensive, check out and pick a new team in free agency was right there on a platter in late May. Instead, he collected himself and eliminated James for the second straight June, scoring 43 points in a Game 3 road win and finishing off the sweep with his first career postseason triple-double.  The flak that rained down during the Rockets series resulted from two years of pent-up anger. Durant’s ball-stopping and off shooting nights were the first serious signs of vulnerability since the Hamptons 5 formed, and a Houston upset could have had cataclysmic off-season ramifications for Golden State. Durant brushed aside the growing mob by continuing to be the unguardable scoring machine he’s been for most of his career. The Rockets, who admitted to an “obsession” with the Warriors, had no chance at stopping him or even keeping him away from his favorite spots. They were left hoping Durant would miss. Same for the Cavaliers, who had even less of a chance given their weaker perimeter personnel.Sure, Durant on the Warriors is unfair. But Durant—with his determination, focus, length, smooth stroke, solid handle, high release point, deep range, hesi pull-up jimbos, well-honed fakes, ability to hit turnarounds over either shoulder, and killer late-game mentality—is unfair, period.For the sixth time in this list’s six-year history, Durant finished second to James. In truth, he did everything he needed to do to stake a strong claim to the No. 1 spot. James, thanks to a magnificent postseason run, just did everything he needed to do to hold Durant at bay one more time. — BGAs James (27.5 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 9.1 APG) has waded into political and social justice issues, expanded his philanthropic endeavors, launched a budding entertainment empire, and positioned himself as one of the country’s most visible fathers, he’s taken to wearing and sharing a new motto: “More than an athlete.” The 14-time All-Star and aspiring billionaire knows the financial and emotional power of catchy slogans and hashtags— from “Just do it” to “Strive for Greatness” to “Kid from Akron”—and this latest entry will serve him well as he prepares to shift out of his prime and grow his net worth in L.A.Make no mistake: James is more than an athlete, but he’s still the NBA’s most outstanding, most valuable and most awe-inspiring athlete. He shook the league by leaving the Cavaliers for a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers in July, he helped open a public school in his hometown, he will sell untold warehouses full of yellow No. 23 jerseys, and he will dominate headlines, magazine covers and trending topics all season long. But when the term “celebrity athlete” is used to describe him, the emphasis should remain on the second word rather than the first. His immense basketball intelligence, extraordinary skill, unprecedented longevity as an elite player, and capacity for raising his game in the postseason and in late-game moments demand it.  Basketball historians will look back in 20 years and lament the fact that James, now 33, has just four MVPs to show for his decade-plus of dominance. Last season was another potential MVP that got away; While James Harden was a worthy winner, James had a strong case too. He played all 82 games, led the league in minutes, and carried Cleveland to 50 wins despite two roster overhauls and multiple long-term injuries to his fellow starters. Individually, he ranked in the top-three in PER, Win Shares and WARP. Although he downshifted his night-to-night effort on defense, he was the determining factor between wins and losses as often as anyone in the game. James led Cleveland to a 30-15 record in games that were decided by five points or fewer in the final five minutes, and he ranked first league-wide in clutch points, second in clutch plus-minus, third in clutch assists, and fourth in clutch rebounds.Before a flat ending against a clearly superior opponent, James’s 2018 postseason was a mini-movie. He led the playoffs in PER, Win Shares, minutes, points, shots, free throws and assists, compiling averages of 34.0 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 9.0 APG. During 22 games, he tallied eight 40-point games, four triple-doubles, multiple buzzer-beating game-winners, his first full 48-minute playoff game since he was 21 years old, and the first 50-point game in the Finals since Michael Jordan in 1993.Those two months of basketball featured raw emotion when he jumped on the scorer’s table after drilling a three to beat the Pacers. They featured exquisite skill when he nailed a running banker to beat the Raptors. They featured remarkable will when he posted 35 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists on the road to outlast the Celtics in Game 7. And they featured perhaps the most visible agony of his career when his Game 1 for the ages was undone by J.R. Smith’s blunder.James tops this list, for the sixth time in its six-year history, because there’s no other active player who could match all the achievements listed above. And because there’s only one other basketball player in history who had the capacity to strike all the chords listed above. Like Michael Jordan before him, James the athlete will eventually be eclipsed by his own legend. But as he prepares to lead a new team of prospects and misfits in a fame-obsessed metropolis, it’s clear that time hasn’t yet come. — BGGEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five? By not changing anything at all. With a berth in Qatar on the line in a place the U.S. has never won, it’s all business.The Bucks forward’s block came in a critical moment in the fourth quarter to solidify a 118-116 win.\n",

      "The Best DC Comics Heroes  The DC Universe boasts some of the most popular characters and heroes of any popular media in the world, but with over 10,000 characters in the mix, who are the best among them? Here’s our list of the top characters in DC’s expansive catalog.Superman is possibly the most powerful being in the DC Universe. First appearing in Action Comics #1 in 1938, Kal El is an alien from the planet Krypton. His parents launched him into space as their planet exploded and he landed on earth where he was raised as a human, Clark Kent, and grew up to be a journalist for the Daily Planet.Early in his adulthood, Clark receives a message from his late father and learns of his Kryptonian abilities, which have been enhanced thanks to the abundance of sunlight available on Earth. Clark can fly, lift massive objects with his super strength, deflect bullets with his own body, and even shoot lasers out of his eyes. Superman is a founding member of the Justice League and is powerful enough that Batman creates contingency plans in case the Man of Steel ever goes rogue.Bruce Wayne doesn’t have any superpowers, but thanks to his exceptional intellect and vast wealth, that’s never stopped him from being one of the greatest heroes in the DC Universe. After the murder of his parents when Wayne was a young boy, Wayne dedicates his life to fighting criminals and trains physically and mentally to become Batman.Batman first appeared in 1939 with the 27th issue of Detective Comics. He’s a founding member of the Justice League and has gone toe to toe with some of the best villains DC has to offer, including the Joker, Deathstroke, Bane, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and many more.Robin is Batman’s trusty sidekick and several characters have taken on the role including Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Tim Drake. The Boy Wonder’s first appearance was in Detective Comics #38 in 1940 and he has been a trusty companion to Batman ever since.The first Robin, Dick Grayson eventually goes on to become Nightwing and Jason Todd, the second Robin, becomes an antagonist known as The Red Hood, after his apparent murder at the hands of the Joker. More recently, Batman chose his own son, Damian Wayne, to become the fourth iteration of the character during the 2009 Battle for the Cowl storyline.Nightwing is the persona Dick Grayson takes on after leaving the role of Robin, but the character’s origin actually comes from the Superman storyline in which the Man of Steel takes on the name of Nightwing as he protects the planet Kandor alongside his friend Flamebird or Jimmy Olsen. Dick Grayson decides to take up the original Nightwing’s mantle after drawing inspiration from the legendary Kryptonian vigilante.Drawing on his experiences as an acrobat and the Boy Wonder, Grayson uses a high-tech suit and gadgets to patrol Gotham, most notably, his pair of eskrima clubs which can act as grappling hooks or even line guns as well as melee weapons.Princess Diana of Themyscira or Diana Prince when she’s blending in with humans is Wonder Woman, and she made her debut in All Star Comics #8  in 1941. Wonder Woman is a founding member of the Justice League and is known for her heritage as an Amazonian warrior. She uses an array of magical objects she uses to fight crime, including the Lasso of Truth, indestructible bracelets, a projectile tiara, and her invisible jet.Wonder Woman is also descended from Zeus and thus possesses godlike powers like immortality and the ability to fly. The character draws inspiration from early feminism and is perhaps the most popular female hero in the entirety of the DC Universe.Green Lantern is a name several characters in the DC Universe have taken on, with the first being Alan Scott in All-American Comics #16 in 1940. Originally wielding a magical ring crafted from a magical lamp, the Green Lantern alias was later reimagined as a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a kind of cosmic police force.The Green Lantern’s powerful rings allow them to manifest almost any object they can imagine into reality and control it using their mind. Besides Alan Scott, other characters who have taken turns as The Green Lantern include Hal Jordan, John Stewart, and Jessica Cruz.Flash is the alter ego of at least four different characters throughout DC Universe history. True to the name, Flash can run faster than the speed of sound using the power of the “speed force.”The speed force is so powerful that it allows Flash to literally run through time.Jay Garrick was the original Flash and debuted in Flash Comics #1 in 1940, but Barry Allen, Barry’s nephew Wally West, and Barry’s grandson Bart Allen have all stepped into the role at different points. Flash has worked both as a member of the Justice League and Teen Titans and even competed in several races against Superman.Aquaman first appeared in More Fun Comics #73 in 1941 and is another founding member of the Justice League. The character is massively popular and remains one of the world’s most recognized superheroes to this day.Aquaman’s true name is Arthur Curry and he is the half-human, half-Atlantean king of Atlantis. He is capable of communicating telepathically with sea life as well as breathing underwater and he wields a three-pronged trident against his foes.Billy Batson is a young homeless boy who can transform into an adult superhero by speaking the word “Shazam.” Shazam can fly and possesses superhuman strength and speed. He first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 in 1940.Billy gains his abilities from a wizard who tells him he has fought evil for 3000 years using the powers of the gods Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury (SHAZAM), but is now too old to continue. Billy takes on the wizard’s responsibilities and regularly battles with the Monster Society of Evil. Shazam’s original name was Captain Marvel, but D.C. began to downplay that name in favor of Shazam after a copyright dispute with Marvel over their superhero of the same name.The Martian Manhunter is an original member of the Justice League. His real name is J’onn J’onzz and he and made his first appearance in Detective Comics #225 in 1955. J’onzz is a humanoid Martian with green skin and has several powers and abilities. He can change shape, turn invisible and speak to other beings telepathically in addition to his super strength and flying capabilities.J”onzz uses his shapeshifting abilities to disguise himself and better blend in with humans. He often takes on the persona of a detective named John Jones during the course of his adventures and he is among the most powerful members of the Justice League.Hawk Girl first appeared in Flash Comics #1 in 1940 and she is one of the first female superheroes to appear in DC comics. Many different versions of Hawkgirl have appeared since the heroine’s original debut with characters including Shiera Hall, Shayera Hol, and Kendra Saunders stepping into the role.Hawk Girl wears armor with a pair of artificial wings that allow her to fly and uses weapons out of medieval times like her mace. The character often appears alongside her male counterpart, Hawk Man.Garfield Mark Logan is Beast Boy and he’s capable of shapeshifting into any animal he sees be it in his everyday life or in a picture. He first appeared in The Doom Patrol #99 in 1965 and has worked as a member of both the Doom Patrol and the Teen Titans during his superhero career.Garfield gains his abilities after contracting a rare disease that only the West African Green Monkey is capable of surviving. Garfield’s father attempts an experimental procedure, turning Garfield into a green monkey for 24 hours in a desperate attempt to save his son’s life. While Garfield does indeed survive the virus, his father’s procedure has the unintended consequence of turning him green and bestowing him with his shapeshifting abilities for the rest of his life.Starfire is the alter ego of Princess Koriand’r of the planet Tamaran. SHe first appeared in DC Comics Presents #26 in 1980. Like Kryptonians, Starfire’s people derive their powers from solar energy. Starfire can fly and shoot blasts of ultraviolet energy called star bolts from her hands. She left her homeworld for Earth after a bitter feud with her sister, Blackfire, who attempted to enslave and then kill Starfire.Upon her arrival on Earth, Starfire meets Dick Grayson’s Robin and joins his team, the Teen Titans, which includes Beast Boy, Cyborg, and Raven. She even blends into human society using the alias Kory Anders to become a professional model when she isn’t thwarting evil with the Titans.Similar to Bruce Wayne, Oliver Queen is a playboy billionaire who moonlights as a costumed superhero. Queen’s alter ego, Green Arrow, first appeared in More Fun Comics #73 in 1941 and uses his incredible skill with a bow and arrow to patrol the streets of Star City and Seattle. In addition to his standard arrows, Green Arrow makes use of an array of specialty arrows like grapple, sticky, and explosive arrows to adapt to a range of situations.Green Arrow is sometimes associated with left-wing politics, at one point even losing his fortune to become a hero for the poor and working class. He has also fought alongside a number of other popular DC heroes including Black Canary and the Green Lantern as well as other members of The Justice League.Black Lightning made his debut in Black Lightning #1 in 1977 and was the first Black American superhero with his own series in the DC Universe. Jefferson Pierce is his real name and he was a top Olympic athlete before moving to Metropolis to be the principal of Garfield High School. He uses an advanced utility belt that gives him electric powers to clean up his neighborhood of Southside or “Suicide Slum” Metropolis.In later storylines, Pierce either internalizes the powers of his utility belt over time or he is reimagined as being born with the innate power to channel and control electricity with his body. At one point, Black Lightning teams up with the Justice League and is offered a position in the group before turning them down.Raven is the Cambion daughter of a human mother and demon father, Trigon, and goes by the name Rachel Roth when she wants to pose as a normal human. She’s a member of the Teen Titans and can sense emotions and control her soul separate from her physical body in addition to being proficient in the ways of magic.Raven came to the Justice League and asked them to help her defeat her father, Trigon, but they turned her down and she turned to the Teen Titans including Robin, Kid Flash, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Cyborg, eventually becoming a permanent member of the team.Victor Stone is Cyborg and he is the son of scientists who subject him to experiments to enhance his intelligence as a young boy. He first appeared in DC Comics Presents #26 in 1980. An interdimensional creature that emerges from one of his parents’ experiments kills Victor’s mother and critically injures him while he is visiting one of their labs.Victor’s father manages to save his son by implanting him with prosthetics all over his body, including the better part of his head. Victor is initially horrified and resentful of his father, but he eventually learns to harness his new body in the fight for justice, joining at different points with the Justice League and the Teen Titans.Nite Owl is one of the main heroes in the 1986 limited series Watchmen. Hollis Mason and Dan Dreiberg each take a turn as Nite Owl over the course of several decades and two generations of vigilantes. Mason joined the masked vigilante team, the Minutemen in 1939 before ultimately retiring in 1962 and passing on the mantle of Nite Owl to Dreiberg. In 1985, a street gang breaks into the retired Mason’s home and tragically murders him.Dreiberg also retires as Nite Owl for a time after President Nixon makes masked vigilantism illegal, but he steps back into the role after the murder of the Comedian, a former member of the Minutemen, and slowly uncovers a murderous plot to save the world with the help of other masked heroes like Silk Spectre and Rorschach.Silk Spectre is the superhero identity of the mother and daughter Sally Jupiter and Laurie Juspeczyk, and both appear in the original 1985 run of Watchmen. Sally was a member of the Minutemen and was an American sex symbol and superhero pin-up model during her career.Laurie serves as the Silk Spectre after her mother’s retirement and has romantic relationships with both Doctor Manhattan and Dan Dreiberg during her career. Laurie has a somewhat strained relationship with her mother, but as she uncovers the murder plot behind the Comedian’s death, she slowly unravels a dark secret about her mother’s past and her own lineage that turns her world upside down.There’s something wrong with Rorschach or Walter Kovacs, who is the only masked vigilante who remains active after Nixon makes vigilantism illegal. He’s antisocial and thinks like a conspiracy theorist based on his monologues and journals, but he might be onto something when he begins to investigate the murder of the Comedian with suspicion of a vast conspiracy to kill masked vigilantes.As deranged as the man might be, Rorschach drives the plot of Watchmen forward with his investigation, bringing his old team back together to solve the mystery. He’s most notable for his ever-morphing mask which changes into various shapes resembling the psychological Rorschach test.\n",

This NBA list ranks all of the league's current standout top players and NBA stars currently playing. It's common to see lists of the greatest basketball players of all time, but considerably more difficult to consider athletes' relative strengths while their careers are still ongoing. Looking back on the career of a Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, or Magic Johnson once it's complete, there are many factors to consider: number of championships, overall contribution to great teams, even just looking at the statistics. But who can say while an athlete still plays whether their good years are in front of them or behind? And harder still to compare their merits in comparison to other players who may be injured, have overall less experience playing professionally or are just going through a slump.This list attempts to sort through all the NBA's most popular and famous current all stars to find the most talented, and the players who are the most essential to have on a winning team to truly determine who is the best active player in the NBA today. LeBron James and Stephen Curry, two of the most iconic and celebrated players to ever compete, dominated in the early rankings, but a number of other challengers for the title—such as Houston Rockets phenom James Harden and the legendary Russell Westbrook—have become favorites as well.Who's the best player in the NBA today?

      "Best Marvel Comics of 2018Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansDecember 13, 2018 by Dave 4 Comments Marvel’s been in a hot seat of their own making since the conclusion of Secret Wars (and really before then, considering they illogically launched “All-New All-Different” Marvel *prior* to the universe-shattering event’s conclusion. Despite their ability to reign as the leading market share publisher throughout a turbulent time, there’s no question Marvel *knows* they’re in need of a new perception. The question remains whether they can quite settle in on an answer for how to correct course.As you may remember, all the way back in the previous age of October 2017, Marvel announced “Marvel Legacy,” their newest linewide banner. Legacy promised a DC-Rebirth esque oversized one-shot by Jason Aaron and Esad Ribic (among various others), and uh, old numbering? Despite this tantalizing combination, Legacy barely made it three months into 2018 before Marvel announced May would bring a very on-the-nose “Fresh Start.”As a result, 2018 promises to be pretty clearly divided into two halves, with the best of the first half rounding out the end of Marvel Legacy, and the remainder of the year building Marvel’s “Fresh Start.” These are the best comics Marvel has released in 2018!All-New All-Different MarvelComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

The Jane Foster/Thor era, with incredibly talented artist Russell Dauterman, reigns as one of the most public and successful products of Marvel’s “All-New All-Different” linewide blowup.Hardcore fans of the Odinson will be pleased to know the Jane era came to an effective, heartfelt conclusion this year, in what was year-in and year-out one of the best books in the Marvel lineup.Joined by Secret Wars: Weirdworld creative partner Mike Del Mundo, Aaron is far from finished with the world of Thor and Asgard.Black Panther has been and will continue to be one of Marvel’s most interesting comics so long as Ta-Nehesis Coates is writing the title. For my money, the Legacy era of Black Panther took a muted step back, but so far this series has paid dividends when consumed in bingeable chunks. I have no reason to believe otherwise with Black Panther in 2018!The Donny Cates Rising Superstar tour reached fever pitch with the writer’s work on a single Thanos story arc titled “Thanos Wins.” The immensely entertaining future-flung narrative benefited from a broader increase in Thanos’ profile due to Avengers: Infinity War, as well as the fact that it’s extremely entertaining marvel playground insanity.From cosmic ghost rider to all sorts of Marvel cosmic mash-ups I can’t even talk about without spoiling, “Thanos Wins” is already assured a spot in the best Thanos comics pantheon.Speaking of Cates, his time writing Doctor Strange didn’t generate quite the same amount of Infinity War laden hype as “Thanos,” but that’s a bit like saying Doctor Strange isn’t *quite* the same measure of sorcerer as Loki, the new sorcerer supreme. Wait, what?For my money, Cates’ storytelling choices are even more interesting in Doctor Strange, reviving the long gone presence of a Marvel 2000’s mainstay, and developing the lasting legacy of Bates the ghost dog. Plus, the first story arc features the art of Vision artist Gabriel Hernandez-Walta!Writer Christina Strain delivers teenage X-angst at its best.Although technically 75% of the series was published in 2017, Saladin Ahmed and Christian Ward’s work on Black Bolt is too good to keep off the 2018 best of list. I’ve suggested as much before, but it’s amazing how *good* Inhumans comics have been during the already forgotton MCU bomb that was ABC’s Inhumans. Black Bolt is the cream of the crop, cementing Ahmed and Ward as two of the most talented figures in comic book storytelling, and cementing the Absorbing Man and Titania as one of the most compelling romances in Marvel comics!I had tunnel-beneath-the-basement expectations for this miniseries, but it continues the Inhumans broader hot streak of excellent comics!To be fair, Marvel fans are hard up for Fantastic Four comics after the series (admittedly *very* effective) conclusion at the end of Secret Wars. Nonetheless, the Thing and Human Torch team-up series is everything I wanted and more, sporting writing from Chip Zdarsky and art from Jim Cheung. Best of all, Marvel 2 in 1 annual #1 merges the Infamous Iron Man (aka Doctor Doom) with the results of Secret Wars and Jonathan Hickman’s time writing Fantastic Four. It’s a continuity dream come true!The Tom Taylor tribute hour continues, as his new X-Men team book with Mahmud Asrar is the best X-Men title Marvel’s had in years.Every time I sort my comics collection I give some thought to future use. Will I read these again? Will my kids? You Are Deadpool might be the surest bet to get endless hours of use by future generations. If you happen to find these “role-playing game” comics at your local comic shop, I highly, highly recommend checking them out for a completely different Marvel Comics reading experience. I have a hard time imagining the experience playing as well on digital, too, so splurge for print if you can!Al Ewing and Joe Bennet’s post Civil War 2, post Secret Empire resurrection of Bruce Banner as the Hulk is both one of the best Marvel comics of the year, and flat out one of the best comics of 2018. What happens when Bruce Banner finally accepts that he can die, but the Hulk can’t.The creative team of Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman have boasted their Venom is better than Watchmen, and while that’s patently absurd, I’ll be darned if I’m not going to admit Watchmen doesn’t have symbiote dragons.The Kate Bishop era of Hawkeye concluded with issue #18, and Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero managed to deliver one of the best superhero comics of the past 2 years. Thompson’s writing of Bishop leverages the Fraction, Aja, Wu era as a launching pad, placing the Young Avenger in her element as a west coast private eye.I wasn’t sure what to expect from the Runaways relaunch, but the creative team of Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka have quickly turned the franchise into one of Marvel’s finest. Everything about this series just looks and feels like the Runaways at their best, honestly not seen at this level since the Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona days in the early 2000’s.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: 2018, MarvelIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Xavier A Barrios D says March 18, 2019 at 4:25 amThank you once again, Dave. I follow your “best of the year” lists every 365 days, and have been doing so for some time now. Thanks to you, I’ve been introduced to so many great storylines I wouldn’t have otherwise. Unfortunately, and as it seems to happen more and more often in recent years. I didn’t like most of these titles. The only ones I truly enjoyed were the first few numbers of 2 in 1, and of course, Immortal Hulk. I seem to be stuck in the storylines of old, by Bendis, Hickman, Jenkins, David, Kyle and Yost. Whatever the case, I wouldn’t know any of those if it weren’t for your webpage. Again, thank you so much, and may we keep reading you for decades to come!\n",

      "The Best DC Comics of 2021!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJuly 20, 2021 by Dave 2 Comments 2021 is a recovery year for DC Comics, emerging from the final fumes of DC Rebirth, Death Metal, and the Dan Didio editorial reign, with a unique opportunity to carve out a new vision for the publisher. The year began with the two month “Future State” timeline, before segueing into a wide variety of series relaunches and creative turnover in DC’s Infinite Frontier.The sheer amount of change makes this year a little more difficult than previous years in determining best ofs and entrance points, but honestly, it also makes for one of the most interesting lineups DC’s had in a few years.Below you’ll find the best DC Comics of 2021, updated throughout the year as new comics are released and I read new favorites!Best Comics of 2021Best Marvel Comics of 2021Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!To say James Tynion IV is having a moment is an understatement. When Tynion was announced as the next Batman writer after Tom King’s not-quite-100 issue run, it felt a bit like a tentative stopgap with one of DC’s most reliable regulars and disciple of DC mainstay Scott Snyder. Now, it’s clear it was a prescient passing of the torch to arguably the *best* writer of American comics in 2021.Since taking over Batman, Tynion has delivered “Something is Killing the Children,” “Department of Truth,” “Wynd,” “The Nice House on the Lake,” and the horror anthology “Razorblades” (with Steve Foxe). My full best of 2021 list basically requires a category *just* for his works. Oh, and not by accident, his post “Joker War” Batman has offered the best take on Gotham since *at least* the “Wedding of Batman and Catwoman.”For my money, the most fascinating thing about this era of Batman is Tynion’s willingness to truly create new characters for the shared universe. Given the history of publishers taking advantage of creators, there’s been a deliberate resistance to giving away the best ideas, but Tynion is in such an inventive space it hasn’t mattered. Whether or not you’re in love with Punchline, Clownhunter, Ghost-Maker and the like, the mainline title simply feels *fresh* in some thrilling ways.Yet, it’s Tynion’s work with Guillem March on “The Joker” that stands out to me as the best of the bunch. Post Joker War and Infinite Frontier #0, the clown prince of crime is the world’s most wanted criminal (even more so than usual), and former Gotham Police Commissioner Jim Gordon is put on the case to track him down. The noir-ish take on DC’s underbelly outside of Gotham is brilliant, tense, and gripping, as is the decision to predominantly focus on The Joker through the impact of his evil on the Gordon family.Speaking of Tynion, I can’t remember the last time a first issue had an approval rating as high as the first issue of the eight issue Black Label series, The Nice House on the Lake. It seems like every single critic I respect *adored* this series debut with a fervor I really don’t think I’ve seen since Tom King and Mitch Gerads on Mister Miracle. They’re not wrong either, as The Nice House on the Lake is a stylish reimagining of the apocalypse, with Alvaro Martinez joining Tynion’s The Department of Truth artist Martin Simmonds as yet another disciple of Bill Sienkiewicz blending the lines of comics and reality.My favorite DC Black Label launch of 2021 is Cliff Chiang’s vision of a future for Selina Kyle and Gotham City, inevitably seen as a response to Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns but with a flavor all its own. After long runs as the artist on works like New 52 Wonder Woman and Paper Girls, Chiang strikes back here doing nearly everything in “Lonely City,” writing, drawing and coloring the work.Between this and characteristically strong work from Ram V, it’s a good year to be a Catwoman fan.For more, check out my interview with Cliff Chiang!I have a confession: I don’t get Dan Watters and Dani’s Coffin Bound. I respect it, and I appreciate it, but I definitely do not get it. Which is a shame because I have it on good authority from my own insecurity that all the cool kids certainly love this Image Comics book!Fortunately, Watters and Dani team-up with the Coffin Bound team of Brad Simpson and Aditya Bidikar to tackle Gotham City in the wake of Joker’s assault on Arkham Asylum. All Batman’s most mentally unstable villains – at least those that didn’t die in the Joker’s attack – are now loose as Gotham descends into a new Arkham City.That? That I get.Watters and team approach the the familiarity of Batman’s rogues gallery through the lens of a Psychologist working with the GCPD, inviting comparisons to a Gotham Central that’s even more on the fringes, and with a much healthier dose of righteous 90’s nostalgia.The gap between the announcement of John Ridley’s perspective on the DCU and the actual oversized physical Black Label books was so large that it feels like a small miracle that the content actually lived up to the hype. Remarkably, all that potential of Academy Award winning screenwriter John Ridley taking on the DC Universe is actually met, with a fascinating exploration of the role of race, social status, and class in the well worn superhero comics landscape.Guiseppe Camuncoli illustrates what is effectively a series of 5 biographies from the POV of Black Lightning, Mal Duncan, Katana, Renee Montoya and Thunder (the daughter of Black Lightning). This is DC’s Marvels, but if Busiek and Ross were more interested in society than supes.NK Jemesin and Jamal Campbell’s Far Sector is an instant classic, finally concluding this year with the best Green Lantern story in years. On one hand, the introduction of Jo Mullein is the kind of starmaking character entrance that should permeate the shape of DC’s Green Lantern mythos for years to come, and on the other hand, it would almost be better if Jo wasn’t wasted the way Jessica Cruz, Simon Baz, and arguably even John Stewart have been in the many decades of occasionally tepid Green Lantern ongoings.Ram V is one of my favorite writers in comics right now (These Savage Shores, The Many Deaths of Laila Starr, Blue in Green are all must reads!), but I don’t think he’s had the standout Big 2 work to quite make him the household comic fan must-buy he should be. That’s changing with Swamp Thing, a wonderful limited series with Mike Perkins and Aditya Bidikar.Ironically, Ram V’s work on Catwoman is every bit as good, but it’s the use of Future State as a launching pad for Levi Kamei’s role as the new DC Swamp Thing that feels truly special, like we’re at the start of a special creative genesis. Swamp Thing feels like a work very much in conversation with the character’s legacy (particularly Alan Moore’s), but building towards something we’ve never seen before, and that’s exactly what shared universe comics should do.DC Rebirth ensnared Damian Wayne, son of the bat, in the very charming Super Sons, but after five years of the World’s Tiniest, it’s time for a new look for Damian. Joshua Williamson and Gleb Melnikov take Damian out of Gotham and into a League of Lazarus Hunger Games esque assassin tournament to wash off the battering of Tom King’s City of Bane. Easily one of my favorite surprises from DC in Infinite Frontier.If we’re being honest, the bar for a beloved Infinite Frontier Nightwing relaunch was remarkably low. After literal years of wandering the wastelands with the lost memories of Ric Grayson, Tom Taylor and Bruno Redondo return Dick Grayson, Nightwing, to Bludhaven and the familiar challenges of Nightwing’s past. The difference this time is that after the death of Alfred in “City of Bane,” the bat-family father figure leaves Dick an immense fortune, and now it’s up to him to solve the problems of Bludhaven with tremendous wealth.It’s an interesting set-up, and Tom Taylor brings precisely the same level of heart and human empathy to Dick Grayson as he’s done across both the DC and Marvel universes for years now. The real star, though, is the style and flair of Bruno Redondo and Adriano Lucas, capturing a unique blend of David Aja’s Hawkeye and Chris Samnee’s Daredevil.I put off checking out Infinite Frontier Wonder Woman for a long time. I really wanted to love the G. Willow Wilson and Mariko Tamaki runs, but was never especially enamored with either (despite loving both writers!). After the alleged starring role in the hypertime chaos of the tremendously disappointing Death Metal, what would make this era of Wonder Woman any different?In the hands of Becky Cloonan, Michael W. Conrad, and Travis Moore, the answer is to mix up Diana’s mythology, landing her in a mystery of Norse gods instead of her usual Amazons and Olympians. Maybe it’s just the concerning amount of God of War I’ve been playing lately, but it’s thrilling to watch Diana navigate the Aesir and Vanir with fresh eyes, familiar but dramatically different from the Asgard of Marvel’s Thor-verse. In addition to the change of realms, Wonder Woman is also full of just the right amount of surprise DC Universe cameos and intrigue.I’m generally skeptical of the surge in “color” based anthology comics (Harley Quinn: Black, White & Red, or Marvel’s Wolverine Red White and Blood), but Superman: Red & Blue is a standout exception. It’s riveting to watch rotating roundtables of excellent comics creators take their shot at a 10 page short Superman story to match the character’s impossibly rich & iconic legacy. The anthology format works wonders for Superman, a character with such a depth of mythology and thematic resonance to work with.There’s a lot of great work throughout the collection to date, but standouts for me so far include the Coffin Bound creative team with a Mxyzptlk story, James Stokoe with classic Silver Age Superman sci-fi, and Daniel Warren Johnson’s “Generations.” Truly, though, there are far more hits than misses, and the nice thing about anthologies for Superman is you’re not stuck with a creative team you don’t like! My main criticism is I’d like to see more from the Superman family/mythos, as the Chuck Brown and Denys Cowan take on Val-Zod is a nice surprise in the bunch.Grant Morrison’s “last” DC Comics work, a four issue miniseries starring an aged Superman and a reformatted Authority, is a fascinating capstone on a glorious career writing Supes. I love the decision to focus on a post-peak Superman, to reflect on how the Justice League have helped and failed the world in equal measures over the decades, and to consider a passing of the torch as Superman moves from unbeatable brawler to team-assembler and strategist.Mikel Janin gets to graduate from gorgeous Batman art to gorgeous and regularly strange Fort Superman work, as Morrison calls back to favorites like Natasha Steel, Ultrahumanite, and the New Gods.Honestly, though, the best writing you’ll find on the subject matter comes here, from David Mann’s piece on the full history of Morrison and Superman!I’m pretty endlessly interested in new futures for Shilo Norman, the successor to Scott Free’s “Mister Miracle” mantle from Jack Kirby’s New Gods. Apart from Kirby and Grant Morrison’s work on Seven Soldiers, there isn’t a heckuva lot of material though! Shilo’s story gets a new spin through Future State and now into a six issue miniseries.Brandon Easton does interesting work here exploring Shilo as an individual, and specifically as a black celebrity whose skin color isn’t known by the adoring fandom of the greatest escape artist show on earth. Fico Ossio and Rico Renzi give “Source of Freedom” an explosive vibrancy, making it truly one of the most spectacular visual spectacles across the DC line right now.Honorable Mentions: Static Shock: Season One, Batman, Catwoman, Titans Academy, Crush & Lobo, Batman: Urban Legends, RorschachFiled Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: best ofs, DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Top 100 NBA Players of 2022: And the Best Player Is ...Who will be the NBA’s best players in the 2021–22 season? Sports Illustrated‘s annual Top 100 list is back, aiming to answer that question.This year, the rankings were determined holistically by a panel of NBA writers—Chris Herring, Rohan Nadkarni, Michael Pina and Jeremy Woo—through a combination of data and subjective evaluation. (As far as the content of those discussions is concerned, consider the first rule of Fight Club.) The goal remains to evaluate players in a vacuum as much as possible, without overvaluing team context in taking stock of their quality.To be clear, these rankings are specifically for the upcoming season and do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2021-22. As has been the tradition here, rookies were not considered. So it’s best to consider these rankings as short-term value projections. This is not a representation of a player’s trade value or contract value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The possibility of growth or decline are factors, tied to players’ age and career stage. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact: offense, defense, structural or otherwise, and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill-sets.Availability due to injury and the ensuing recovery process are also factors here: this year, Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson were most affected in that way. The biggest snubs from this year’s list can be found here.For further reference, explore SI.com’s Top 100 lists from 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. SI’s Michael Shapiro, Ben Pickman and Wilton Jackson also contributed player profiles to this year's list. To listen to how the list was made: Listen to the Open Floor podcast. SI TOP 100: Read 100-51, 50-31 and 30-11Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports10. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers (Previous rank: 3)If 100% healthy heading into this season instead of nursing a torn ACL, Kawhi Leonard would’ve likely finished top three on this list. Before he churned through another robotically superb stretch of playoff basketball (during which he led the entire field with a 30.6 PER and, with the Clippers’ backs against the wall, turned out an iconic 45-point showpiece in Game 6 against the Mavericks), Leonard was his typically efficient self, barely missing entry into the 50/40/90 club by a hair. When healthy, his general adaptability is such a convenience. Leonard neatly fits in any lineup, playing any position, filling any role. It’d be wise to give him the ball and let him dictate every offensive possession, but he doesn’t need it in his hands to impact the game positively. He rebounds. He defends (extraordinarily well, still). He reigns over every square inch his wingspan allows him to with as much ferocity as anyone in the sport. Alas, Leonard may not play a minute this season, which complicates his placement on a list like this. But so long as he’s included, it doesn’t make much sense to drop anyone who soared as high as Leonard recently did out of the top 10. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated9. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 7)Davis fulfilled his potential in the bubble in 2020 with a dominant run that resulted in his first championship. He averaged 27.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, with a silly 66.5 true shooting percentage that, when combined with his versatility on defense, made him as valuable as any player on the planet. (The Lakers outscored opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions with Davis on the floor and were outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions when he sat, the widest differential on the team.)If he followed that stretch up with an entire season’s worth of similar production, Davis would in all likelihood rank No. 1 on this list. Instead, he had the most disappointing year of his career, with a statistical chasm unseen since his rookie year. Injuries played a role, as did an unprecedentedly brief offseason.His mid-range shot was inconsistent, albeit relied upon more than any other time since he was drafted. He took fewer shots at the rim and didn’t aggressively seek trips to the free throw line as frequently as someone so physically imposing probably should. The thing is: A down Davis year is still better than 99% of his contemporaries’ best. At only 28 years old, there’s no reason why he won’t bounce back. Generational talents tend not to lick their wounds for very long. — MPErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated8. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers(Previous rank: 10)When he is at his best, there is nobody in the league who can match up with Embiid. His combination of size, strength, power and touch is the antidote to the spacey style of modern basketball. Embiid is a dominant low force presence in a league continuously less familiar with those types of players. And in addition to his prowess on the block, last season Embiid turned in a stellar performance as a midrange shooter. The increase in efficiency from the midrange plus excising lazy threes led to the best scoring average and field-goal percentage of Embiid’s career. On the other end of the floor, Embiid’s presence in the paint all but guarantees a top-flight defense. Even if he’s not the type to switch onto guards, Embiid is still more than capable of sticking with smaller lineups—particularly when he’s in great shape. If there’s anything holding Embiid back from winning more individual accolades—and a higher spot on this list—it’s his health. Injuries are a persistent problem for Embiid, even if he was willing to battle through a torn meniscus during the Sixers’ most recent playoff run. On any given night, Embiid can be the best basketball player in the world. He’s a unique two-way force, and there’s still room for more once he finally plays on a roster optimized for him. — RNErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated7. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 4)Harden, when accounting for injuries and level of responsibility, is perhaps the most consistent volume scorer of his era. Even in 2021, when Harden averaged his fewest points since 2012, he remained one of the most feared scorers in the world. There is nuance to the way Harden collects his points despite his never ending quest for threes, layups and free throws. He’s deeply knowledgeable at using his body and leveraging his physicality to create space. Harden’s herky jerky movements are calculated, all part of a delicate dance to put his defender off balance. Harden’s footwork is so precise the moment he senses vulnerability he can pull into his shooting motion. Harden’s methods are undeniably effective. And in Brooklyn, he showed he didn’t have to rely on his scoring prowess to be effective. Harden earnestly took on the role of point guard for the Nets, and he delivered by racking up nearly 11 assists a night. Harden was a willing passer and table setter for a team that could let him isolate more comfortably than any one before it. If there’s a hole in Harden’s game, it’s on the defensive end, where he’s never been confused for a stopper. Still, his shortcomings there are a small price to pay for what else he brings to the table. Harden may never get a chance to prove he’s the proverbial “best guy on a championship team.” But if you pair him with anybody else in the top 20, you instantly have a contender. — RNGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated6. Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks(Previous rank: 9)It stands to reason the 22-year-old Dončić may one day inherit the top spot on this list, as he continues on an all-time great trajectory. He’s prolific in every facet as a full-time offensive engine, with the size and pace to create mismatches in lieu of elite quickness, preternatural scoring know-how, and ingenious passing and processing speed. It’s not a bad bet that he may eventually average a triple-double … and he’s only been in the league for three seasons.The Mavericks are still working to build a championship-caliber core around Dončić, and there are some areas of individual improvement to watch for in the interim. Despite taking a lot of difficult shots, he upped his three-point clip to a respectable 35% last season, which should trend up over time. He’s capable of better than 73% from the foul line, and he gets there plenty. Upping his efficiency along those margins, coupled with any reduction in turnovers (which are a byproduct of how often he has the ball) will take him to the stratosphere, statistically speaking. It seems foregone Dončić will eventually win an MVP regardless. The fact that nothing said here is exaggeration tells the story. He’s going to be here a long time. — JWWatch NBA games online all season long with fuboTV: Start with a 7-day free trial!Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets(Previous rank: 8)For all the talk of the unicorn era in the NBA that never quite was, what exactly are you supposed to call Jokić? Who was the last MVP who simply loved to pass and scored almost reluctantly all while flummoxing great players with his distinct lack of athleticism? Jokić is singular, and watching him play is one of the most fulfilling experiences for fans of fun basketball.Jokić is a threat to get a triple double every night. He’s got brilliant touch as a shooter, allowing him to pop for threes on pick-and-rolls or pull up for little midrange Js near the elbow. Jokić doesn’t bulldoze people in the post. Instead, he prefers to attack with a flurry of moves before finding the perfect angle on the backboard while uncorking a shot from a comically awkward position. Of course, he’s a much better passer, keeping the Nuggets’ offense humming and constantly throwing players into open spots on the floor. Jokić’s passing isn’t only aesthetically pleasing or some kind of nerd cred test; it’s genuinely a boon to Denver’s attack, allowing them to pick up buckets most other teams can’t.For years now, Jokić has been one of the most impactful offensive beings in the NBA. His defense will never be elite, though a decent enough one can be built around him. What matters more is that Jokić’s rare set of skills not only continue to raise his own game to new heights, it raises those around him as well. — RNJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated4. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors(Previous rank: 5)No matter what happens next, Curry is going down as the most prolific shooter ever. He’s on pace to pass Ray Allen for the top spot on the career threes leaderboard, and sits a hair above Steve Nash for the best free throw percentage of all time. And he just put together the highest scoring average of his career, posting 32 points per game at age 32, while playing through injury. There’s essentially no assailing what Curry has accomplished, and his ubiquitous style of play has aged gracefully. Nobody else bends defenses as blatantly, and whether or not the ball happens to be in his hands is not the problem. The three-point revolution already happened, and the copycats are still coming—a direct product of Golden State’s championships—but no guard will ever do exactly what Curry does, or replicate the style with which he does it.The Warriors did fall short in the play-in round, and it’s now been two seasons since they made the playoffs. Provided Curry can maintain optimal health, it’s hard to think that streak will last. His effortless range, clever finishes and discerning IQ are as sharp as ever, and there’s a strong argument for him as the most individually skilled player in the whole league. He’ll require additional defensive insulation as he enters his mid-30s. But Curry will always be the guy you want shooting the ball when it counts, and looks poised to extend his run atop the league’s guard hierarchy for as long as his body can handle it. — JWErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 1)Someday LeBron, the most important, imposing and intelligent player of his (and possibly every other) generation, won’t crack this list’s top three. Even after a massively disappointing first-round dismissal (the first of his career) in which despite averaging 23.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 8.0 assists the 36-year-old actually looked mortal, that day isn’t this one.James doesn’t have the same athletic advantage he once did. And even though he’s a step slower, with the physical authority to control every square inch of the floor finally starting to fade, he’s still LeBron. Nobody anticipates live action more succinctly. Nobody analyzes whatever’s happening in their peripheral vision quicker, or makes a fast, ever complicated game look so elementary whether the ball is in their hands or not, on offense or the other end.Bet against him at your own peril. If and when healthy (a more significant caveat every year) James is still a paragon of basketball expertise. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks(Previous rank: 2)Antetokounmpo, a reigning NBA champion and winner of two out of the last three league MVPs, presents the strongest case for No. 1 outside of Durant. Giannis isn’t the most fluid scorer. But who else can give you nearly 30 a night—and 50 in a Finals clincher—while setting up teammates a half dozen times per game, while also scorching opponents in transition and playing some of the best, most versatile help defense in the league at 7 feet tall? No one but Giannis does that. And he’s done it while staying relatively healthy for a superstar. His ability to quickly bounce back from one of the uglier knee hyperextensions you’ll ever see changed the course of basketball history, and earned the Bucks a title. That shouldn’t be taken for granted. — CHErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 6)After he spent the entire 2019-20 season recovering from a torn Achilles, Durant’s peak ability was called into question for the first time in his career. At 32 years old, would the four-time scoring champion bounce back and look exactly like he did when we saw him last—which is to ask, could he again be one of the world’s two or three best players?Durant’s regular season was disrupted by a strained left hamstring and left thigh contusion, then overshadowed by a blockbuster trade for James Harden. But in the 35 games he did play, KD looked like the same guy, with a statistical profile that either matched or exceeded most of his career averages.Then the playoffs happened. In them, Durant submitted the most impressive series of his career, averaging a hyper-efficient 35.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists against the Bucks, eventual world champs that had zero answer for his excellence. It was pantheon worthy, and made debate over if we’ve ever seen a more ruthless iteration completely justifiable. When the dust settled, his place at the top became a universal truth. Anyone who wants to lobby for another candidate can just ask Giannis Antetokounmpo. Standing on the court after he just eliminated Durant’s Nets in their own gym, the two-time MVP called his opponent “the best player in the world.” Who are we to argue? —MPMore NBA Coverage:Sports Illustrated may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five?

      "LIST: Most Popular Marvel Characters & Their PowersFormed in 1939, The Marvel Comics Group is one of the big three American comic publishers alongside DC Comics and Dark Horse.

After graduating, he returned home and set about dethroning the man who exiled him. Killmonger has already been dubbed one of the best villains on-screen, and there’s no wonder why.

He has spectacular eyesight and hand-eye coordination, can fire multiple arrows in a few seconds, and directly hit small targets in far distances.

A series of transformations turned him into a furry blue cat/simian-faced hulk of a man. Don’t let the enormous slouching posture fool you, Hank much prefers to use his massive brains to solve problems and after a career in biochemistry is perhaps the most identifiable spokesman for mutant rights. Other than his brain, Beast has incredible superhuman strength, skills in acrobatic combat and can perform tasks with his feet or hands. The mutant can run at speeds up to 40 miles and survive hard impact without injury such as falling from great heights.

He can freeze an enemy’s blood as well as any moisture in the air. Iceman’s ‘cold’ powers are so strong, he once stopped a nuclear explosion.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: His powersDid You Know?

She still believes in Professor X’s dream but the inner Dark Phoenix would rather see everything burn.Year Created: 1963How she got her Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: Her powersDid You Know? Wolverine has killed Jean more than 5 times!Superpowers: Invisibility, forcefield projection, combatant and martial artist.The wife of Marvel’s First Family, Susan Storm-Richards has always had the affectionate heart and soul. Most of the time, this involves making sure Ben and Johnny aren’t fighting, that Johnny isn’t being reckless, and that Reed isn’t completely buried in his science. Without her though, the family would likely fall apart in about a week. Gaining her powers after falling victim to a cosmic storm, Invisible Woman uses light waves for invisibility and the projection of forcefields.Year Created: 1961How she got her Powers: Hit by cosmic raysWeapons: Her powersDid You Know?

As a result of first trying to bond with Spider-Man, Venom is invisible to Spider-Sense, which for any Spider-foe is a free pass to knock the snot out of the web-head. When not tainted with anger-issues, Venom is not all bad as he deeply wants to be a hero. Although he does have the intimidating power to form spikes, use his sharp teeth and expand in size. In fact, he’s said to be stronger than Spider-Man himself.Year Created: 1984How he got his Powers: Eddie Brock became the alien’s new host.Weapons: Web-shootersDid You Know?

From such humble beginnings (and a talent for controlling the weather) she’s risen as a goddess of southern Africa, Xavier’s second in command, a queen of Wakanda and an inspiration for mutants everywhere young and old. She can control the weather, including the ability to generate lightning and tornadoes. Not only can she also fly, Storm can cause pain to her enemy’s ear by controlling the atmospheric pressure.Year Created: 1975How she got her Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: Handguns, firearms, knivesDid You Know? Storm was the first black female Marvel superhero, first appearing in Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975).Superpowers: Peak human condition, special operations master, resistance to telepathic powers, camouflage & stealth skills, pro martial artist, high pain tolerance. Frank Castle was an ordinary guy, but everything went wrong after he returned home from doing his duty for the US Marine Corps to find his wife and daughter murdered by criminals. Famous as a superhero who kills people and packing lots of firepower, Frank is on a one-man crusade to kill every criminal in the world. Thanks to his skills in hand-to-hand combat, vast experience in warfare, and ability to camouflage and tolerate extreme levels of pain, of course. Although we didn’t see it in the Netflix show, The Punisher is also resistant to psychic and telepathic powers.Year Created: 1974How he got his Powers: Trained in the militaryWeapons: Rifles, handguns, grenades, knivesDid you Know? Nick Fury and Tony Stark highly admire The Punisher’s extreme pain tolerance. He even avoids taking painkillers to avoid drowsiness and slowed reflexes.Superpowers: Telepathy, can cause paralysis, memory loss, mental illusions, create mind bolts of psychic energy.Professor Charles Xavier was always one of the luckier mutants. He was able to easily hide his mutation while growing up, but that didn’t stop him from helping his kind out. Founding a school for gifted youngsters, Xavier is the most famous of mutantkind’s representatives, and his spokesmanship for mutant relations has been famously compared to Martin Luther King Jr – except this guy’s considered the world’s most powerful telepath. Xavier can telepathically communicate with anyone in the world, sense the locations of mutants, read minds and memories and manipulate and paralyze others to great extent. Oh, and he can project psionic blasts, too.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: His powersDid You Know? Professor X’s telepathy once covered the entire world and has even helped him connect mentally with aliens in space.Superpowers: Strength, speed, durability, energy manipulation, telepathy, powers based on the Infinity Stones.One of the biggest threats to all reality due to a fixation on claiming and using six stones that can warp reality, Thanos the Mad Titan is a threat that no one sneezes at as he tends to smash everything in his way. Besides this, he is also famous for his relationship with the cosmic aspect of death. This Marvel villain has superpowers that very few can defeat.

The so-called “unbeatable” Thanos was once defeated by Squirrel Girl in GLX-MAS #1 published in 2005.Superpowers: Strength, speed, stamina, durability, weather manipulation, flight (via Mjolnir), dense skin and bones with a resistance to injury.The Son of Odin, the God of Thunder has been one of the Avengers and a protector of the innocent since the very beginning. On the side of his hammer Mjolnir, the inscription “Whosoever wields this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor” has been his trademark. The hammer brings him great powers including the ability to summon lightning from his hands, block energy blasts and bend elements. Besides his extraordinary strength, Thor has great fighting ability, energy manipulation powers, flight skills, and complete control over the weather. Hulk has even labelled him a threat.Year Created: 1962How he got his Powers: Born the Asgardian God of ThunderWeapons: Warhammer MjolnirDid You Know? Thor was a frog throughout issues of The Mighty Thor due to none other than Loki’s magical schemes. Superpowers: Genius-level intellect, size-changing via Pym Particles, telepathic communication with insects, dimension-hopping.One of the first Avengers, Hank Pym is an eccentric genius who created Pym Particles, the exotic matter that can shrink and grow objects while retaining their proportionate strength. Taking on other names like Giant-Man, Goliath, Yellowjacket and even his own wife’s alias, The Wasp, he’s a bit unstable and prone to nervous breakdowns. That doesn’t take away his extraordinary abilities to shrink to the size of an ant, exceed in hand-to-hand combat, and grow to gigantic heights.Year Created: 1962How he got his Powers: Tested the Pym Particles serum on himselfWeapons: Stinger firearmDid you Know? Like Doctor Strange passes through multiverses, Ant-Man can travel through micro-versus – “tiny parallel dimensions”.Superpowers: Control of magnetic forces, magnetism-based flight, can make telepathic commands.The Master of Magnetism, leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants, closest friend of Charles Exavier, and possibly the world’s second most massive hypocrite. It’s hard to not feel sorry for a guy who survived the Nazi death camps but explaining Eric Lehnsherr, is no small feat. Though he certainly doesn’t make it easy with his plan to supplant humans with mutants as the dominant species on Earth. With his power to control metal and manipulate magnetic forces, there’s no going near this guy. Heck, he apparently can use magnetism to “raise islands from ocean floors and move mountains”.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: Helmet, powersDid You Know? Magneto has the power to move large asteroids and levitate a 30,000 ton nuclear submarine!Superpowers: Superhuman strength, flight, immunity to mind control.Vigilante private investigator, Jessica Jones is one of the fresher faces of Marvel’s roster.

Marvel’s first big hit is one of the only movies that doesn’t feature a Stan Lee cameo!Superpowers: Superhuman strength, energy blasts, flight via rocket boots, inventor genius.T’Challa is not the only high-profile king moonlighting as a super-person. King of Latveria Victor, von Doom is a complex sort, he may blame absolutely everything wrong with his life on Reed Richards (which is frequently his downfall), but he’s also worked with some of the heroes. In particular, he has enlisted the help of Doctor Strange to rescue his mother from Mephisto’s realm. The Doctor considers him one of the “most powerful practitioners of sorcery” thanks to his great ability to emit mystical blasts and force-fields, as well as cast spells.Year Created: 1962How he got his Powers: His mother’s Roma heritageWeapons: His powersDid You Know? In the comics, Doctor Doom has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe.Superpowers: Peak-level human condition, martial arts expert, 10 Rings of Power.Tony Stark’s greatest opponent is not a rival CEO like Obidiah Stane or the Russians trying to copy his work, but this 100-year-old Chinese aristocrat. Beyond a genius military mind, the Mandarin is an intellectual equal to Iron Man. He is technologically aided by the 10 Rings of Power alien technology he wears on each finger that through invention and practice, grant him numerous powers such as cryokinesis, electrokinesis, the ability to emit energy beams and blasts, levitation and mind control to say the least. Year Created: 1964How got his Powers: From the 10 Rings of PowerWeapons: 10 Rings of PowerDid You Know?

      "How do you pick the top 10 characters in all of Marvel U? Here's howMarvel currently boasts over 8,000 unique characters in its comic universe, but that's just quantity, not quality. Who are the best Marvel characters in all of its comic books, ever? That's the question we're looking at today.To answer, we delved into Marvel Comics' greatest stories (and even in the not-so-great ones). We also canvassed reader interest, as well as those of the comics professionals who work on these fictional characters.But this isn't a popularity contest either. We sat down and figured out who the best Marvel characters are based on their importance to Marvel and the Marvel Universe, their standing among fans, and most importantly, the stories that have been told about them and their character development over the years.Be prepared to find some of your favorite characters on our list, but also be prepared to be upset because some of your favorite characters didn't make the list. Ultimately, this is one person's opinion - and we look forward to you sharing your list with us on Twitter and Facebook. First appearance: Fantastic Four #52 (1966)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Black Panther comics The Black Panther is a different brand of superhero than most because he not only wears a heroic mantle, but also a crown; a crown that carries with it the weight of an entire nation. And, we're not being colorblind here - he's not white like most comic book heroes then (and now). Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in what later Marvel staffers said was an effort to feature Black superheroes in an era in which that was rare, the Black Panther was also an outsider to the Fantastic Four (and even the Avengers) and carried a dignified exoticism and connections to a near-mythical country that was refined and more technologically advanced than modern humanity at the time.But through works like recent stories by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and John Ridley with artists including Brian Stelfreeze, the Black Panther has grown into a complex, multi-faceted hero who struggles to be a better version of himself - and it's T'Challa's willingness to embrace and learn from his failures that sets him apart from many other ultra-competent heroes with all the resources in the world.The Black Panther sits in a unique place at Marvel - as the king of a nation who has recently realized that his own monarchy is at odds with democracy and the equal rights of his subjects, but who is still trying to find better ways to contribute to his home nation and Marvel's world at large.First appearance: The Incredible Hulk #180 (1974)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Wolverine comicsWolverine is the ultimate brooding loner. Combine that with a gritty tenacity and knives on (and in!) his hands, and you have a unique superhero cut from a very different cloth than those who came before him - who has carved himself a niche that countless characters have since tried to occupy.Wolverine entered the Marvel Universe like a classic Clint Eastwood western character - as a mysterious stranger who rides into town; short on words, long on violence. That profile has propagated an intense mystery about his past that continues to deepen even as creators try to fill in the blank pages of his history.And again, he's got knives on his hands - and it's actually cool, despite how silly the idea sounds on its face.Wolverine's catchphrase is 'The best there is at what he does.' And that's proven to be true, over and over again as imitators, variants, and clones (sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally) come and go.First appearance: The Savage She-Hulk #1 (1980)\n",
      "Recommended reading: She-Hulk by Soule & Pulido: The Complete CollectionShe-Hulk began comic book life as a way for Marvel to protect its turf. Originally a female knockoff of her famous cousin Bruce Banner AKA the Hulk, Jennifer Walters was created by Marvel to establish ownership of a female Hulk before CBS could create their own version as part of its then-contemporary Incredible Hulk TV show. But she quickly became more than a way to establish ownership of the concept in-house, eventually surpassing many of the most intrinsic qualities that make the original Hulk a great character himself - the juxtaposition of strength, anger, and the duality between the human being and rampaging monster. She-Hulk was also Deadpool before there was a Deadpool - a hyper-aware, sometimes metatextual, fourth-wall-breaking character who can fit in alongside other mainstream heroes without skipping a beat.From the novel idea of a lawyer specializing in superhero law to a successful businesswoman dealing with the realities (and fiction) of controlling (or not controlling) her anger issues, She-Hulk isn't a cliché or an archetype, which makes her one of top (eighth-best, actually) characters in the Marvel U.First appearance: The Fantastic Four #1 (1961)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Fantastic Four #51 (1966)The Thing is the heart of the Marvel Universe. That's right, beneath that orange, craggy exterior and gruff demeanor lies a wounded, underdog soul that was emblematic of the Marvel Universe in its earliest years. Unlike the Marvel we all know today, in the early '60s it was a more upstart publisher with dogged perseverance and individualistic spirit that made it stand out in the crowd. Yup, just like Big 'ol Ben.Unlike many powerhouses like Thor, Captain Marvel, and DC's Superman who are also easy on the eye, the superhuman strength that allows the Thing to trade punches with gods like Galactic comes with the price of a giant, lumbering, monster-like appearance. And that steep price has driven some of the greatest Marvel stories of all time like the classic 'This Man, This Monster.'But underneath his literally gruff exterior, Ben has the proverbial heart of gold, and it's the display of his human qualities - like playing pranks on Johnny Storm or his fierce loyalty to best friend Reed Richards - that contrast with his appearance and makes the Thing so endearing and enduring.Ben fits in the tapestry of the Marvel Universe like one of those patchwork pieces of his rock-like skin. And readers who were alive during the '70s know he along with Spider-Man were the face of Marvel during that decade. But even today the Thing is a keystone - the one piece in the proverbial arch that is the Marvel Universe that makes everything and everyone else around him work better.First appearance: Invincible Iron Man #55 (1973)\n",
      "Recommended reading: The Infinity Gauntlet (1991)Thanos is the kind of character that can be (and probably is) a case study in a  college psychology class. Inspired by the Greek god Thanatos and a heaping helping of Jack Kirby's New Gods (particularly Metron and Darkseid), Thanos' beginnings were humble (a throwaway Iron Man villain on a janky helicopter) but he developed and grew in stature through stories in Captain Marvel, Warlock, and Silver Surfer series to eventually reach his ultimate destiny in the seminal 1991 Marvel Comics event The Infinity Gauntlet.Birthed of regret and raised with animosity, the grown-up Thanos has an obsession with death (both the lower-case death and the actual Marvel entity Death) which has led him on a single-minded crusade for order - his order - in the Marvel Universe, often leading to body counts in the millions.All that power, it fits like a glove  ... or gauntlet ... in this case.Since then, Thanos has been Marvel's ultimate bad guy. Creator Jim Starlin and subsequent writers like Jonathan Hickman, Jason Aaron, Donny Cates, and Kieron Gillen have made him more than just a Jaws-like force of nature, adding depth and pathos -- while still keeping his proverbial teeth sharp and menacing.With his MCU role culminating in Avengers: Endgame, Thanos has reached an even higher level of stature to become one of the most iconic villains, and even, we daresay characters - good or evil - in all of popular fiction.First appearance: Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975)\n",
      "Recommended reading: X-Men: LifedeathStrong women have been a mainstay of Marvel Comics - particularly in the X-Men - and Storm, without a doubt, is one of the strongest and hardest to break. Born in Harlem but forced to raise herself as a street thief in Egypt after becoming an orphan, she made a path for herself that included titles like a goddess, X-Men member, X-Men leader, queen of Wakanda, and now the ruler of Mars.While her mutant ability to control the weather is a pivotal part of her, thanks to the writers and artists that have added layers to her character, it's Storm the woman and her often dueling qualities of tenacity, anger, forgiveness, and compassion that have forged her into a titan of modern fiction and cemented her into the bedrock foundation of Marvel Comics most important characters.First appearance: Captain America Comics #1 (1941)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Captain America comicsCaptain America is a quintessential part of the Marvel Universe, but it took decades for him to reach that potential. One of the dozens of flag-waving patriotic superheroes created during the early  '40s during Second World War, it wasn't until the early 60s when he was thawed from an icy tomb in a story by Stan Lee and his co-creator Jack Kirby in an Avengers story that he started on the path to become who he is today.In that era he became an anachronistic version of Americana, battling the dark turns America can take. He wasn't the first US patriotic hero that carried a shield, but it's those more modern stories that made everyone forget who the other guy was (Archie Comics' The Shield, by the way, created months before Captain America).Although not a founding member of the Earth's Mightiest Heroes, he quickly became the face of the team which for many readers added to his profile as the classical heroic ideal for Marvel's brand of superheroes. Chris Evans' portrayal of Cap in MCU films over 60 years after the character's creation only raised his stature further. While comic book Captain America is still as young and vital as always, Evan's live-action Cap will cast a shadow over the MCU for years to come, as evidenced by 2021's The Falcon & Winter Soldier Disney Plus streaming series and lingering rumors of Evan's return in some form or another.Captain America is not just a flagbearer for the United States, but for Marvel Comics as well - and that's something even fans that aren't from the US can (and do) appreciate.First appearance: Uncanny X-Men #129 (1980)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Uncanny X-Men #143 (1981) The X-Men are amazing - uncanny, even - but it wasn't until Kitty Pryde entered the picture that readers gained a real perspective of how uncanny. Created as a 'girl next door'/grounded character in the original Chris Claremont/John Byrne era, Shadowcat was a hit character from the start - and she only got better over the years.The secret? Unlike many young comic book heroes, she was allowed to grow up, and all of us readers could grow up with her.Kitty Pryde is one of the few characters that have significantly grown, matured, and evolved over the years - from a fresh-faced early teens student to a full-on adult team leader today. Even while she was in her teens and early adulthood, readers met hardened versions of her such as 'Days of Future Past's Kate Pryde and Excalibur's Widget. But she also grew up for real in such touchstone series as Kitty Pryde: Agent of SHIELD, Mechanix, and especially the current Marauders ongoing.Of all the mutant characters, Kitty Pryde has proven to be the most human when it comes to evolution and growth, And that doesn't just make it stand out among her fellow X-Men, but among the entire Marvel Comics pantheon as well.First appearance: Fantastic Four #5 (1962)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Doctor Doom: The Book of Doom omnibus There's a common adage in fiction writing that also applies to life that villains think of themselves as the hero of their own story. That their motivations are noble and just even if the world sees them as misguided or evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marvel Comics, there's no better example of the nobility of villainy than Doctor Doom.Like most of Marvel's greatest characters, Victor Von Doom has a tragic origin story - but whereas so many of Marvel's best characters overcame their tragedies to become superheroes, Doom took a different route. While his descent into supervillain is a thorn on the side of most of the Marvel Universe, Doom is not without a sense of honor and watching a complex, flawed, but at times noble and sometimes even regal character evolve, grow, and become steeled like the armor he wears is one of Marvel's greatest literary achievements.Whether it's fighting the Fantastic Four, Luke Cage, or the entire Marvel Multiverse, Doom is always the star (if not hero) of his own story - no matter whose logo is on the cover.First appearance: Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Spider-Man comicsSpider-Man redefined what a superhero could be, and although many have followed in his footsteps, he's still number one, definitively at Marvel and arguably anywhere else.Spider-Man works because he's the plucky undersized street-level teen underdog with a heart of gold - burdened with great regrets but gifted with an eternal desire to do better, for himself and others. In a world of mostly adult superheroes who seemingly have their life all figured out, Peter Parker works because whether as a teen or young adult, he's both who we all are and some of us want to be - flawed but trying, always punching upward and reaching a hand to help those who need it.Add to it his quirky but mesmerizing costume design by Steve Ditko and the nearly-trademark ways he and his powers are visually depicted in comic books (and later in television, film, and video games), what you have is not just one of the world's most famous superheroes, but one of the most unique characters in modern fiction of any medium.So why is Spider-Man deserving of being not just on a list of Marvel's best characters but alone on the top spot? Because what Ditko and Stan Lee created back in 1962 is constantly being fine-tuned, revisited, and remade in a way that keeps him current yet classic. Today you can still tell a Spider-Man story about the awkward teen learning to exist in a world of adult superheroes and villains, while also telling a story about the Peter Parker who's been married and a father, or a corporate CEO, or in the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and the MCU's Spider-Man: No Way Home, a mentor to a younger Spider-Man.Spidey is Marvel's best character because he was, and is, and probably always will be the most interesting character in any supervillain battle or superhero team-up, and his stories speak to the generations of comic readers who have grown up with him - and a generation that is growing up with him now.Chris Arrant covered comic book news for Newsarama from 2003 to 2022 (and as editor/senior editor from 2015 to 2022) and has also written for USA Today, Life, Entertainment Weekly, Publisher's Weekly, Marvel Entertainment, TOKYOPOP, AdHouse Books, Cartoon Brew, Bleeding Cool, Comic Shop News, and CBR.

      "REPORT: Ranking the Most Popular NBA TeamsThe NBA is BACK! With pre-season well underway, millions of NBA fans across the US will be tuning in and voicing their opinions online for the upcoming season.With the utilization of social listening data, a new report from Bookies.com has revealed which NBA teams have generated the most interest online over the last year. By analyzing social media posts using specific keywords, the report highlighted which NBA team was the most popular, what demographics were most common, and also which social media platform dominated the conversations.The LA Lakers are the most followed NBA team on Twitter with a staggering 10.1 million followers, so it’s no surprise that they create the biggest buzz online. With 5,870,777 posts over the past 12 months, the Lakers Nation is everywhere – scoring more than a million more than the Golden State Warriors, who ranked second with 4,311,312 posts. The reigning champs, the Milwaukee Bucks, followed third after gaining a massive social media buzz after their win to the Phoenix Suns.The Portland Trail Blazers and the Minnesota Timberwolves sit bottom of the list with only 169,012 and 150,325 mentions, respectively, over the last 12 months – around 40x less than the Lakers.The younger male demographic (18-24) are NBA’s most vocal online, ranking top for 23 of the teams. Surprisingly, followers aged 55-64 ranked five times in the most popular demographic category for teams such as the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs, and the Washington Wizards.To collect the data, social listening was utilized and acquired through Linkfluence between September 2020 – September 2021.To determine the order of the list, the percentage of posts online, demographic, and social media % was collected and put in an order with the highest percentage at the top.\n",

      "Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2019-20 season?\n",
      "Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2019-20 season?Several times per year, our Global NBA.com staff votes to determine the best players in the league. Given how perceptions change based on performance and context, it's a fluid discussion that changes significantly over the course of a season.A lot has changed since we last updated our player rankings following the Toronto Raptors' run to the NBA title. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Al Horford, Jimmy Butler, and Chris Paul are on new teams and there's been plenty of time to reflect on last season and project moving forward.Since Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are out with significant injuries and will face major question marks whenever they eventually return, they were not considered for the purposes of this go-around.Before jumping into the top 30, we'd be remiss for not bringing up some of the biggest names that missed the cut. It's a testament to the overall talent pool that there are this many impact players who couldn't crack the top-30.In all, there were 12 players who received votes from our panel of nine voters but fell outside the top-30. Here they are in order of most to least:For quick reference, you can scroll to the bottom for a table with all 30 players ranked in order along with their stats from last year's regular season. As for the unveiling itself, you'll find three bits of info to go along with each name:The biggest stat... meant to illuminate a key number heading into the season or address an important narrative about that player.The biggest question... what's the biggest concern or unknown for each player heading into the season?The skinny... Tweet-ish length blurb on what's in store for this season. What's realistic? What are expectations? Just enough room for analysis but short enough to keep the eyes from glazing over.via GIPHY \n",

Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers2. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers1. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksAt long last, the moment (we hope) you've been waiting for has finally arrived: Our officially official ranking of the top 100 NBA players for the 2019-20 season is officially here. Officially.Before you journey down this rabbit hole with us, be sure to check out the position-by-position installments of our top-100 series if you haven't already:Players are being evaluated relative to their performance for this season only. Benefit of the doubt is awarded to stars with limited appearances, but only if they've delivered at a high level during their time on the floor or seem likely to pick up steam in Disney World or during the potential Chicago bubble.Anyone who hasn't logged at least 500 minutes is not eligible for inclusion. This makes for some tough cuts—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Klay Thompson, etc.—but this is, in essence, a 2019-20 retrospective. Sample size has to matter.Disagreements are inevitable. Which is fine. Friends argue sometimes. Just know that we didn't assemble this pecking order to upset you. Any villainy you detect is unintentional*.                 *For the most part.If not for injuries that limited their availability or cost them the entire season, each of these players would've received top-100 consideration:Cheer up, sadz-havers. And angry-pants-wearers.Steph is a top-five player in any normal season. KD will default to no lower than a top-10 player post-Achilles injury until proven otherwise. And pretty much everyone else on this list, with the exception of Bagley and Kennard, are 2020-21 preseason top-100 shoo-ins, barring any setbacks.These players were tough to leave off, and we very much hate ourselves:100. Donte DiVincenzo, Milwaukee BucksDonte DiVincenzo's basic numbers won't burn up your screen, but his impact on the powerhouse Milwaukee Bucks is clear.On the season, Milwaukee is plus-15.0 points per 100 possessions when Giannis Antetokounmpo plays with DiVincenzo and plus-12.3 when he doesn't.The reason for that uptick is DiVincenzo's gap-filling game. He does a little bit of everything, as evidenced by his 7.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.0 steals per 75 possessions.And while his 34.4 three-point percentage could use some work, his 57.0 true shooting percentage was above average thanks to his ability to finish inside.     99. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersIn his first season with the Indiana Pacers, T.J. Warren has quickly established himself as perhaps the team's best scorer. In the rawest sense, his team-leading 18.7 points per game would suggest as much, though Domantas Sabonis' 18.5 aren't far behind. They're within a point of each other in the percentage of makes that are assisted, as well.What sets Warren apart, though, is his ability to both spread the floor (37.5 percent on 3.0 three-point attempts per game) and run some pick-and-roll. Nearly a fifth of his possessions come as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, and he's scoring at an above-average clip out of that play type.He still leaves plenty to be desired on the defensive end, but for a team that has been missing Victor Oladipo for most of the season, that from-scratch offense is valuable.  98. Derrick White, San Antonio SpursLineup politics have capped Derrick White's crack at appreciable progress. Dejounte Murray's return has relegated him to the bench, and San Antonio's quasi-refusal to play the two together comes at the expense of his minutes.White is not blameless in this dilemma. Like Murray and DeMar DeRozan, he is a limited weapon from distance. Playing all three at the same time is a non-option for an offense that already traffics in cluttered floor spacing. White has, however, shown the set touch necessary to warrant minutes beside Murray on an alternative, DeRozan-less version of the Spurs.More than 20 percent of his looks come as catch-and-fire threes, on which he's shooting 37.5 percent. Defenses are slightly less inclined to go under him in pick-and-rolls than they are Murray, and he's canning more than 50 percent of his twos despite seeing his efficiency drop around the rim.Even the most marginal offensive upticks moving forward would prove massive for White. He plays a brand of defense you feel while watching. His stands against superstar guards and wings are enviable—a tutorial in staying ahead of ball-handlers and not biting on fakes—and he blocks way more shots than any guard standing 6'4\" with unimpressive length should.  97. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatThe easiest gripe to make about Duncan Robinson is that he doesn't do much at a high level beyond shoot. Well, when you shoot like this, that's not much of a gripe.Stephen Curry (2015-16) and Steve Novak (2011-12) are the only players in league history who have matched or exceeded Robinson's 2019-20 marks for volume (10.2 attempts per 75 possessions) and efficiency (44.8 percent) from three.Among players who have taken at least 500 shots from anywhere in a season, Robinson's otherworldly 66.5 effective field-goal percentage trails only a bunch of All-Star centers and 2014-15 Kyle Korver.He's been a flamethrower this season, and the Miami Heat have legitimately fallen apart when he isn't out there spacing the floor. They've been plus-8.8 points per 100 possessions when he's played and minus-4.9 when he sits, giving him a 13.7 net rating swing that ranks in the 99th percentile.Even if he doesn't dish out a ton of dimes or lock down the opposition's best player, the impact driven by his shooting is immense.   96. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsOn the other end of the equation is Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby, a solid offensive player who contributes the bulk of his value on the defensive end.All season, Anunoby has been willing and able to spend time on the opposition's top offensive players. And Toronto's defense ranks in the 84th percentile when he's on the floor. His length, athleticism and switchability are reminiscent of some of the game's top defenders, which makes sense given his standout habits.\"Ron Artest, Scottie Pippen, Kawhi [Leonard], guys like that,\" Anunoby told reporters when asked who he patterns his defense after earlier this season. \"Draymond [Green].\"Those are ambitious targets, but Anunoby possesses the tools to get there, at least on the defensive end.Whether he can carry a bigger load offensively remains to be seen, but simply maintaining his three-point shooting from this season (38.1 percent on 3.4 attempts per game) would make him a prototypical three-and-D specialist.95. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsContinued on-again, off-again availability is not the lone anchor holding down Caris LeVert. A right thumb kept him sidelined for two months, which doesn't help, but his elevated usage has coincided with a steep drop in efficiency.LeVert is shooting under 43 percent inside the arc while both reaching and finishing at the rim on a lower clip. Mid-range jumpers account for a larger share of his shot attempts, and he's not hitting nearly enough of them (35 percent) to justify the outsized share.The context of LeVert's role is his saving grace. Brooklyn's free-agency coup last summer has not translated to a tinier workload. Kevin Durant hasn't yet debuted for the Nets, and Kyrie Irving has missed most of the year. LeVert is still charged with a healthy amount of from-scratch creation, and he's holding his own.His effective field-goal percentage on pull-up jumpers (50.8) is higher than that from Jayson Tatum (50.3). His efficiency on unassisted threes is absurd. Among everyone launching at least three pull-up triples per game, no one touches LeVert's 41.5 percent success rate.That he's officially a trusted decision-maker out of the pick-and-roll props up his argument even more. He is one of six non-point guards clearing 17 points and four assists per game while draining more than 38 percent of his threes—evidence not of a breakout season but of his potential as a No. 3 on what the Nets hope will soon be a really good team.    94. Davis Bertans, Washington WizardsDavis Bertans doesn't do a whole lot on offense besides catch the basketball and shoot it. But when you're as good at that one thing (which happens to be the most important skill in basketball) as Bertans is, you don't need to do much more.Unleashed after three seasons in a much smaller role with the San Antonio Spurs, Bertans is averaging 15.4 points and 3.7 threes this season while shooting 42.4 percent from deep. Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who has matched or exceeded all three marks for a season (and he has done so twice).Those threes aren't garden-variety catch-and-shoots, either. His 45 makes from 28 feet and out trail only Damian Lillard, Trae Young and James Harden. And his percentage from that range (49.5) comfortably tops those three.Extend the range to 30-plus feet and Bertans trails only Lillard and Young. But here's the real kicker: He is an outrageous 18-of-26 (69.2 percent) on those shots.When defenses have to pay attention to a big that far from the hoop, it expands the floor for everyone else. On the season, the Washington Wizards have scored 121.7 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile) when Bertans shares the floor with Bradley Beal. They have scored 106.2 points per 100 possessions (19th percentile) when Beal is on the floor without Bertans.  93. Danny Green, Los Angeles LakersThough he hasn't been quite the impact juggernaut he was in 2018-19 when the Toronto Raptors' net rating was 17.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor, Danny Green has still been a clear positive for the Los Angeles Lakers.And of course, that impact once again comes from far more than scoring. Among the 147 players in NBA history with a 2.0-plus box plus/minus, Green is 136th in points per possession.In 2019-20, he's done all the same things that have carried that value throughout his career. He spreads the floor, hits threes at an above-average rate and is capable of bothering the top perimeter option from about any opponent.  92. Marcus Morris Sr., Los Angeles ClippersMarcus Morris Sr.'s final placement is a tale of two seasons. Free rein with the New York Knicks gave him a certain je ne sais quoi. The numbers were pretty, but they came on a bad team, in a role he would never hold with a better squad.Joining the Clippers, a real title contender, may be a more accurate gauge of his value. That doesn't bode well for him if the season is over. He's shooting 28.3 percent from beyond the arc and has seen his usage rate crater amid a much more talented offensive hierarchy.Judge his season in its totality and Morris still comes out on top. He's downing 38.3 percent of his pull-up treys and averaging a personal-best 19.9 points per 36 minutes on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. The question, as ever, is whether his offensive utility can spill over to a niche role in which he's predominantly a spot-up guy and only situationally tasked with creating off the dribble. His usefulness waxed and waned under similar circumstances in Boston last season, and nothing has changed in Los Angeles, where 75 percent of his made buckets are coming off assists.91. Mitchell Robinson, New York KnicksMitchell Robinson is a lean, mean, shot-blocking and rim-running machine who may be on track to becoming a more athletic Tyson Chandler.He's one of three players in NBA history to start his career with a 9.0-plus block percentage through his first two seasons, and his true shooting percentage is over 20 points higher than the other two.Sure, he's occasionally caught out of position and sometimes chases blocks at the expense of the scheme or a rebound, but he just turned 22. There is plenty of time for him to learn the nuance of NBA defense.At this age, the absurd production—14.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per 75 possessions for his career—deserves far more credit than the shortcomings.90. Marc Gasol, Toronto RaptorsMarc Gasol has posted career-low averages in points (7.6), rebounds (6.3), blocks (0.9) and two-point percentage (44.0) this season, but his impact has been an overwhelming plus because of the way he has embraced his new role on the defending champion Toronto Raptors.Over half (53.8 percent, to be exact) of Gasol's attempts have been threes this season, a mark that is over 20 points higher than his previous career high of 31.4 percent from 2018-19. And he's converted 40.2 percent of those attempts.Having a 5 who forces the opposition's bigs to leave the paint does wonders for players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam, who still do plenty of damage as slashers.And though his raw block numbers are down, Gasol remains an effective deterrent inside. The Raptors have surrendered 6.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. What he's lost in athleticism, Gasol mostly makes up for with IQ. His rotations are always on point, and he's game for whatever scheme head coach Nick Nurse wants to deploy.His more focused three-and-D role has led to a plus-7.5 net rating swing that leads Toronto in 2019-20.   89. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksIt's hard to blame the Houston Rockets for moving on from Clint Capela. Two non-shooters in that offensive system just wasn't sustainable, and the investment the team made to get Russell Westbrook meant he wasn't going anywhere.So, Clint Capela was dealt, and the Rockets went all-in on micro-ball.We haven't gotten a chance to see how Capela will fit on the Atlanta Hawks with Trae Young and John Collins, but there's reason to believe it will work.Capela is an elite roller and lob finisher who has still averaged 13.9 points, 13.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 32.8 minutes per game this season. And Young is already one of the game's best pick-and-roll passers. Capela should continue to get plenty of wide-open dunks set up by his point man.The only sticking point on offense is that Collins already does a lot of that. His expanding perimeter game could loosen things up, but there's some potential for crowding.Capela's real value to Atlanta may come on the defensive end. The Hawks are 28th in points allowed per 100 possessions this season, and every defense Capela has anchored has been above-average.  88. Andre Drummond Cleveland CavaliersNothing crystallized Andre Drummond's decline quite like the trade the Detroit Pistons brokered to unload him this season.They sent him to the Cleveland Cavaliers for John Henson and Brandon Knight (neither of whom were staples of Cleveland's rotation), as well as a second-round pick.\"They dumped him,\" The Action Network's Matt Moore wrote at the time. \"They straight up dumped Andre Drummond. They put Drummond out there like you did with your futon when you were moving out of your college apartment after graduation.\"The ability to avoid Drummond's next contract appears to be the motivating factor of the deal. He's shown better passing chops in recent years, but he's still way behind the curve in terms of the skills expected of bigs these days.Still, Drummond is one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history. And just last season, he posted a plus-11.4 net rating swing. If the passing is here to stay, he can still be helpful. But it will be interesting to see how teams gauge his value this offseason (assuming he opts out).  87. Hassan Whiteside, Portland Trail BlazersThe change of scenery has revitalized Hassan Whiteside. He has registered his best box plus/minus since 2015-16, as well as career highs in both offensive box plus/minus and true shooting percentage.His plus-10.5 net rating swing is, by far, the best he's ever posted. Now, some will quickly point out how many minutes Whiteside has spent with Damian Lillard, and that's fair. But Whiteside has helped the superstar point guard, too.In addition to his 16.3 points, 14.2 rebounds and league-leading 3.1 blocks in just 31.3 minutes per game, Portland has outscored opponents by 3.6 points per 100 possessions when Whiteside has been on the floor with Lillard. When Lillard has been on the floor without Whiteside, the Blazers have been outscored by 3.2 points per 100 possessions.  86. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersHuman bucket Lou Williams will be torching twine long after he files for social security. The aesthetics of his offense are timeless: Give him room and watch him barbecue defenders with an endless array of fakes, wide crossovers, scoop layups, nonchalant-looking pull-up jumpers and floaters. Little about Williams changes from year to year, including this one. His game wants for a smidgen more efficiency, and he still gives zero Fs about playing defense, but his pick-and-roll and scoring artistry dazzle in perpetuity.Lowering his rank relative to the preseason is mostly a matter of splitting hairs. The margin of separation is so, so very thin outside the top 35.Williams' slight reduction in prominence accounts for the difference. As the talent around him has increased, his scoring output per 36 minutes and crunch-time usage have fallen from last year's watermarks. Los Angeles' offense is likewise less of a powerhouse when Williams runs the show without another primary option on the court—a stark departure from last year's performance.85. Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn NetsDeAndre Jordan's arrival never portended anything good for Jarrett Allen. Could he improve and endear himself to the long-term future of the Nets with a Kevin Durant- and Kyrie Irving-approved addition behind him?The answer is, predictably, complicated.Allen's minutes are down, and Jordan was immediately inserted into the starting five following head coach Kenny Atkinson's departure. This development is troubling for obvious reasons. Allen's strengths are Jordan's strengths—screen-setting, rim-running, paint protection—only he's younger and better in a few, if not all, of their shared areas of expertise. More troubling, though, is Allen's lack of development elsewhere. His three-point experiment is done, and he doesn't have any self-sustenance to his arsenal. After converting 44.9 percent of his hook shots last season, he's down to 40.9 percent now.Jordan doesn't have a broader reach, but he is the better passer. And whereas Allen can vanish on occasion, Jordan is more of an offensive constant.This doesn't make DJ the superior player overall. He doesn't crack our top 100 for a reason. Allen is the far more portable defender of the two. He may get outmuscled down low, but he has the side-to-side amble to neutralize threats in space. All of that said, Allen is clinging to top-100 status himself. That won't change unless he improves in the areas he has control over—specifically the depth of his offensive bag.   84. Robert Covington, Houston RocketsLast year's right knee injury may have stolen a morsel of Robert Covington's defensive inevitability, but that's it. He is still one of the league's most versatile and committed stoppers with an approach that exists in service of the entire team.Transitioning into a full-time power forward who moonlights at center (since arriving in Houston) has looked good on him. His rebounding is up to the task, and the Rockets are at their stingiest when he partners with P.J. Tucker on the frontline.Finite offense will always prevent Covington from being viewed in a more esteemed light. What few shots he takes inside the arc tend to come at the rim, an ideal profile for someone who works exclusively without the ball.But when your value is so soundly married to your floor-spacing, a below-average long-range clip—34.9 percent for the year; 35.7 percent in Houston—doesn't quite wow. And though Covington makes up some of that gap in transition, his offense is overdue for another postseason test before he can vault closer to top-50 territory.  83. Kelly Oubre Jr., Phoenix SunsThe 2019-20 campaign has marked a breakout for 24-year-old Kelly Oubre Jr. He's raised his scoring average in each of his five NBA seasons, peaking at 18.7 with the Phoenix Suns.His three-point percentage (35.2) is just shy of the league average on a steady diet of 5.5 attempts per game.And even with those marks on the offensive side of the floor, Oubre's greatest value may be derived from his defensive ability. His length and athleticism allow him to cover multiple positions. His tenacity leads to being second on the team in rebounds per game (6.4) and first in total rebounds.Overall, the Suns' defensive rating has been 2.8 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the floor, though the team still defends at a below-average level. When he shares the floor with another switchy wing in Mikal Bridges, though, Phoenix's defensive rating jumps to the 67th percentile.  82. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersIndiana underutilizes Myles Turner at the offensive end. He has the mobile handle to attack from face-up sets and is crafty enough in the post but is instead consigned to role-player duty. More than half of his shots are coming on spot-up jumpers, and his touches are way down from last season even though he's playing more minutes.That role simplification is equally necessary and unideal. Everyone has wanted Turner to up his three-point volume for the sake of easing the fit with Domantas Sabonis. He's done that; a career-high 44.3 percent of his attempts are coming from beyond the arc.But he's downing those looks, many of which are wide-open, at a 33.6 percent clip, and his timing without the ball needs work. Too many possessions end with him aimlessly occupying the same(ish) space as Sabonis.On the bright side, Turner's defensive captaincy is steadfast. He doesn't match up pound-for-pound with hulkier bigs, but he's a pesky helper and rim deterrent. And while his workload on the perimeter varies by opponent, he has the twitchy bendiness to make dynamic creators sweat on switches.  81. Al Horford, Philadelphia 76ersFor years, the notion that Al Horford was playing out of position as a center for the Atlanta Hawks just sort of floated around the ether of NBA fandom. When finally moved to power forward, it became abundantly clear that he is indeed a 5.The 76ers have been minus-2.4 points per 100 possessions with Horford at the 4 and plus-5.8 points per 100 possessions with him at the 5.This experiment may have made a bit more sense three or four years ago, but Horford's age (34) and the continuing evolution toward positionless basketball have simply made him too slow and interior-oriented to play power forward.Yes, Horford has shown an ability to hit threes, though he's at just 33.7 percent this season, but he still has a propensity to work inside. And it's fair to wonder if his career-high volume from three has contributed to the decline in efficiency.When he's been on the floor with Embiid and Ben Simmons, it's simply been too congested inside the three-point line.He has played nearly 1,000 minutes at the 5, though, and he's looked more like his old self there. In those alignments, he's averaged 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions.80. Tim Hardaway Jr, Dallas MavericksThe 2019-20 season may be the best of Tim Hardaway Jr.'s career. He's posting career highs in threes per possession, three-point percentage, true shooting percentage and win shares per 48 minutes.The Dallas Mavericks have been plus-12.7 points per 100 possessions (98th percentile) when Hardaway is on the floor with Luka Doncic and plus-5.0 when Luka is on the floor without Hardaway.Hardaway isn't the only reason for that difference, but an elite floor-spacer, which is exactly what his 40.7 three-point percentage says he is this season, is what Dallas should surround Luka with.All year, when Luka has kicked it out or around the perimeter, Hardaway has been keyed in and ready to cast off. He's fifth in total catch-and-shoot points and has a 63.7 effective field-goal percentage on those shots.     79. Evan Fournier, Orlando MagicFor a team that has a bottom-10 offense, Evan Fournier has been a life preserver. He and Nikola Vucevic are the only Orlando Magic players with above-average offensive box plus/minuses. He's second on the team in scoring (18.8) and first in threes per game (2.7).And Fournier isn't just a catch-and-shoot option, either. He's done plenty of damage off the dribble. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul are the only players in the league who have matched or exceeded his field-goal attempts (352) and effective field-goal percentage (50.6) on pull-up attempts this season.  78. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsThe 2019-20 season has undoubtedly been a downturn for Draymond Green. His per-game averages of 8.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.8 blocks still present a picture of a versatile point forward, but his efficiency has been abysmal.He's shooting 46.5 percent from two-point range and 27.9 percent from three. His woeful 48.9 true shooting percentage is the worst mark he's posted since his rookie campaign in 2012-13.Turns out, it helps to have Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson around.Still, Green's all-around game has been a boon on a roster that has featured plenty of contributors who might have been in the G League under normal circumstances.When he's been on the floor, the Golden State Warriors' net rating has been 4.2 points per 100 possessions better. Their effective field-goal percentage has gone up two points, which is a credit to his playmaking because his shooting certainly hasn't provided that bump.And most impressive, the defense has actually been average and surrendered 5.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when Green has been on the floor.77. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzHe may be categorized as a small forward, but Joe Ingles has functionally been the point guard of the Utah Jazz's Quin Snyder era.That's tied largely to the fact that he's been with the team as long as Snyder, but during this partnership, Ingles' 1,695 assists almost double No. 2 on the list. His assist percentage over the same span trails only Ricky Rubio and Trey Burke among all Jazz players.He's gotten plenty of credit as a shooter over the course of his career, but Ingles' passing and feel for the game out of pick-and-rolls really drive his value.He's generally been a solid perimeter defender, as well. He doesn't possess the same vertical and lateral athleticism as other wings, but he has solid size (6'7\", 226 lbs), competes and is almost always in the right place on his rotations.Put it all together and it should be relatively easy to see why Ingles is having another high-impact season despite averaging just 9.8 points. On the season, the Jazz have been plus-5.9 points per 100 possessions with Ingles on the floor and minus-1.2 with him off.  76. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesYou're in no way alone if Jaren Jackson Jr.'s sophomore effort hasn't blown you away. His fouling and rebounding remain issues, and for all the positionless tools he sports, he doesn't yet look the part of someone who can lock horns with opposing centers. Memphis allows 113.4 points per 100 possessions (34th percentile) and struggles to keep offenses away from the rim with him at the 5.Still, the Grizzlies have far worse outcomes than a version of Jackson that can't sponge up heavy minutes at center. He has the lateral mobility to hang with contemporary 4s; this isn't the San Antonio Spurs trying to prolong LaMarcus Aldridge's time at power forward.It makes more sense to trumpet Jackson's offensive progress. His three-point-attempt rate has more than doubled from his rookie season while his efficiency spiked by nearly four percentage points. Only six other players who have logged at least 500 minutes are shooting as well from deep (39.7 percent) on eight-plus attempts per 36 minutes: Davis Bertans, Cameron Johnson, Danilo Gallinari, Paul George, Georges Niang and Karl-Anthony Towns.Jackson's range and volume are supreme luxuries on the frontline. Letting so many threes rip is a sure-fire way to ensure he has no trouble playing power forward, and it opens up the floor for his guards. Concern for his defensive progress is fine, but his long-range touch—which he couples with a fair-weather ability to put the ball on the floor, albeit in slow motion—gives way to a matchup-proof quality that cannot be undersold.75. Jonathan Isaac, Orlando MagicJonathan Isaac would've earned much higher placement if not for a left knee injury that might end his season. Thirty-two appearances isn't a lot, but it's enough to reinforce that he—not Aaron Gordon, nor Markelle Fulz, nor Mo Bamba—is Orlando's future.One-man defensive systems have that effect. Isaac is a hellfire draw for any big or wing. His length is ubiquitous in passing lanes, and he can simultaneously guard the big and ball-handler in pick-and-rolls.Getting off jumpers with him in the vicinity is a chore. He ranks in the top seven of both short and long mid-range shots despite missing more than half the season, according to PBP Stats. His length is equally imposing closer to the basket. Opponents are shooting 51.4 percent against him at the rim, a top-11 mark among 67 players challenging at least four point-blank looks per games.Future Defensive Player of the Year candidacy is absolutely in play, if not inevitable, for Isaac. The Magic need only be concerned about his offense. The odds of him developing a serviceable floor game are slim, and he doesn't yet have enough spacing around him to get more bites as the roll man. If he doesn't hone his three-point shot, then Isaac, like Orlando itself, will be up against an artificial ceiling.    74. PJ Tucker, Houston RocketsHas PJ Tucker ever missed a corner three? Asking for a friend.Tucker is the player every contender—and wannabe contender—lusts after: a low-usage shooter and defensive tryhard with positional range that contradicts his size. It isn't enough that he was already the Rockets' most valuable individual stopper on the wings. In the aftermath of Clint Capela's injury and eventual departure, they've made Tucker their de facto center.Living up to that job description isn't easy, period. It is an even more unreasonable ask for a 6'5\" 35-year-old who has made a career out of absorbing the toll attached to playing consistent, unyielding physical defense.And Tucker, for the record, is not some panacea in the middle. Houston's defense ranks in the 34th percentile of points allowed per 100 possessions when he's manning the middle. Sticking him next to Robert Covington has helped quite a bit, but there will always be a functional trade-off to playing sooo small, and it'll usually manifest most on the glass.Nevertheless, Tucker's value isn't exclusively tied to defensive returns. It is more so grounded in the freedom he provides the Rockets. They are the best version of themselves because he can switch from chasing wings to rumbling with bigs. Russell Westbrook, in particular, probably never completes his midseason turnaround without Houston diving into microball—an option the team only ever had because of Tucker.  73. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicAaron Gordon's offensive arc has unfolded like a career-long identity crisis. Is he a big? A wing? Can he shoot? Handle the ball?Definitive answers have yet to be provided—not flattering ones, anyway. Gordon's role has varied. And while he's still most likely best suited as a finisher out of the pick-and-roll and in transition, the Magic have steered him closer to the wing end of the spectrum. They have few alternatives and, thus, no choice.This isn't always the best look for anyone involved. Gordon isn't efficient on drives or when pulling up off the bounce. But he has started to find his way as a playmaker. Head coach Steve Clifford recently saddled him with more pick-and-roll initiation, and he's responded by averaging 5.0 assists—and 8.3 potential assists—over his past 25 games.The Magic won't soon trot out Gordon without another setup man. But his improving feel for facilitation diversifies an otherwise humdrum offense. And if his standstill three-point clip holds—39.3 percent over this 25-game stretch—Orlando will have one of the league's hotter commodities on its hands: a playmaking defensive difference-maker with usable outside touch.  72. Christian Wood, Detroit PistonsThe temptation to vault Christian Wood higher is real real. He epitomizes the in vogue center, someone who is a presence on the glass, swats the occasional shot, strokes triples and even puts the ball on the floor. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Serge Ibaka and Kristaps Porzingis are the only other players clearing 20 points, 10 rebounds, one block and one three-point make per 36 minutes.Sample size takes something away from Wood's year in review, but not much. It isn't his fault that Pistons head coach Dwane Casey stuck with Thon Maker for so long, or that he didn't enter the starting lineup until after the Andre Drummond trade. That Wood's per-game numbers since getting more burn have closely reflected his per-minute output is a big deal.Detroit will need to worry about its defense if he's the man in the middle, though. Wood, an Early Bird free agent after this year, can cover a lot of ground, but he's easily led astray off the ball, and opponents are unafraid to attack the basket when he's jumping center.Offensive variety is still enough to get him by even if he doesn't shore up his defense. He is at home squaring up for set triples, running into quick catch-and-launch looks, slipping to the baskets off screens, beating closeouts off the dribble and driving baseline. He has even flashed more advanced playmaking chops, increasing the frequency with which he finds shooters while on the move.  71. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles ClippersPatrick Beverley continues to be the gold standard for superstar cohorts. Few players are as universally translatable. Even fewer are point guards.Would it be nice if Beverley could negotiate half-court defenses with an off-the-dribble jumper? Or protect the ball better out of the pick-and-roll? Or finish a little more consistently, and frequently, at the rim? Without question. But there is serious value in someone who has lasted at a ball-dominating position by doing just the opposite.Over half of his field-goal attempts come as spot-up threes, which he's converting at a nearly 40 percent clip. He can wreak a little havoc when attacking downhill but doesn't command a predetermined number of touches or shots. He plays offense without ego. It is quite the contrary at the other end.Beverley is a defensive workaholic, and he knows it. And he will let you know it, too. His reputation as a star-stopper neighbors on myth, but someone so emotionally invested in the outcome of every possession, whose motor will never be the least bit tied to his offensive usage, provides inestimable value.70. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursDejounte Murray's return from a torn right ACL that cost him all of last season has not exactly unfurled according to plan. His strengths are as sturdy as ever. He is a terrifyingly talented rebounder for a guard and hasn't lost a step on defense. The nights he does get torched are evidence only of the difficult assignments he draws.Things aren't as rosy on the offensive end. Murray seems more comfortable putting up jumpers and is shooting well on long twos (47.0 percent) and threes (37.8 percent). But these looks come neither in volume nor haste. He needs time to get them off and still hasn't aggressively plumbed his off-the-dribble jumper.San Antonio's offense remains solvable when Murray is on the court. Defenses go under him, and he doesn't have the speed to make them pay off the bounce or the nerve to uncork enough jumpers. He complicates matters with spotty playmaking. He has a tough time capitalizing on pick-and-roll coverage and turns the ball over a ton in transition.To what end Murray's limited offensive growth falls on him is debatable. The Spurs' spacing is far from pristine, and DeMar DeRozan's usage caps the influence he has over the team, both as a scorer and table-setter—not to mention his exposure to Derrick White.For now, at least, San Antonio can count his return as a win. Murray's defensive nose remains intact, and better efficiency from the perimeter, even at minimal volume, isn't nothing.     69. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPrior to this season, Stephen Curry (four times) and Steve Novak were the only players in league history with seasons in which they matched or exceeded Buddy Hield's 2019-20 marks for threes per 75 possessions (4.4) and three-point percentage (39.5).Even in today's three-happy game, that kind of volume and efficiency generally isn't found in the same player. Hield may be making a habit of it.On a roster as young as the Sacramento Kings', Hield has been a steady source of offense, particularly from behind the arc. The next step is getting to the line a bit more. But in the meantime, his shooting out of any situation makes him a dangerous weapon.This season, his effective field-goal percentage is 60.4 on catch-and-shoot attempts and 50.1 on pull-ups.  68. Dennis Schroder, Oklahoma City ThunderDennis Schroder is having perhaps the best season of his career in 2019-20. He's just a shade under his career-best box plus/minus, but he's easily cleared his career highs in effective field-goal percentage and threes per 75 possessions.He's also been a key component in one of the game's best lineups. When the Oklahoma City Thunder have fielded their three-guard attack of Schroder, Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, they have outscored opponents by an eye-popping 31.4 points per 100 possessions, a net rating that ranks in the 100th percentile.And we're not dealing with some minuscule sample here. That group has shared the floor for 850 possessions.They have managed to dominate opponents by exploiting a part of the floor many now ignore. CP3, Schroder and SGA are first, 12th and 24th, respectively, in two-pointers made from 10 feet and out. And all three are shooting at least 44.8 percent from that range (CP3 and SGA are both over 50 percent).Schroder's ability to beat his initial defender off the bounce and hit pull-ups before meeting the rim protector has done wonders for his efficiency, and his 6'8\" wingspan has allowed him to defend multiple positions in those guard-heavy lineups.  67. Jonas Valanciunas, Memphis GrizzliesJonas Valanciunas is navigating center's new world order just fine. The three-point shot he's tested over the past few seasons is a big part of it. He's hitting 36.7 percent of his triples on a career-high 1.7 attempts per 36 minutes, allowing Memphis to leverage him as both a roller and popper.Barreling his way toward the hoop remains one of Valanciunas' greatest strengths. His screens stop players dead in their tracks, and he's averaging a whopping 1.24 points per possession as the roll man (74th percentile).Defenders are still liable to look like puny humans when he goes to work down low. He is both hefty and handy: light on his feet, heavy with his shoulders. He's one of 10 players shooting better than 50 percent on at least three post-ups per game.Merging the traditional with the neoteric wouldn't mean much if Valanciunas couldn't hang on defense. He can. He's not matchup-proof, but his rotations around the basket are on point enough that he's a net-plus back-line stopper when playing beside rangier 4s. Memphis has maintained an above-average defense in the time he's spent next to Brandon Clarke or Jaren Jackson Jr.—nothing if not a ringing endorsement of Valanciunas' capacity to survive the ongoing frontcourt revolution.  66. Devonte' Graham, Charlotte HornetsDevonte' Graham is mission-critical to what the Hornets do. His off-the-dribble volume is the point of origin for everyone else's opportunities. Charlotte's offense opens up at all because defenses respect his pull-up jumper and the burst he shows going left.Efficiency is the cost of that import.Graham is shooting under 40 percent on twos overall and below 50 percent at the rim (11th percentile). His three-point clip has suffered after a strong start; he's at 33.3 percent from beyond the arc since the middle of December. It is clear, often painfully so, that he's being overstretched in his role. His is a game best deployed as a potent complement to an actual star. Charlotte has him running the whole damn show.Forgiving Graham's struggles is relatively easy under these circumstances. His shots serve a purpose. The Hornets' offensive rating improves by 11.3 points per 100 possessions, and their effective field-goal percentage jumps by 4.3 points with him on the floor—impressively huge swings that both rank in the top six among all players who have cleared at least 500 minutes.65. Derrick Rose, Detroit PistonsInjuries have once again put a damper on Derrick Rose's season—hip and ankle issues are the culprits this time—but not before he reestablished himself as one of the NBA's most potent offensive weapons.Only seven players are averaging more downhill attacks per game, a feat made all the more impressive knowing he sees substantially fewer minutes than all of them. He will never draw fouls like he did at the beginning of his career—his takeoff origins are too inconsistent and often angling away from contact—but he's shooting 64 percent around the rim (76th percentile).Most important of all, defenses are reacting to the results: 18.1 points and 5.6 assists per game.His three-point shot remains a wart, but his finishing at the basket and mid-range game command respect. The disorder he creates on the move is Detroit's shot-quality lifeline. Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players who have assisted on more corner threes, per PBP Stats, and the Pistons' offensive rating improves by 4.3 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (83rd percentile).      64. Bojan Bogdanovic, Utah JazzJoining the Utah Jazz has uncomplicated Bojan Bogdanovic's offensive utility. They have him run the occasional pick-and-roll and mix in an iso here and there, but he otherwise exists to open up the floor and alleviate the burden placed upon Donovan Mitchell.Well, mission accomplished.Bogdanovic is one of six non-bigs averaging more than 20 points per game with a true shooting percentage above 60. His company: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton.Last year's Indiana Pacers team leaned on Bogdanovic for from-scratch offense in the aftermath of Victor Oladipo's ruptured right quad. Though he tackled the task admirably, that was always an overextension of his skill set. He is more in his wheelhouse with the Jazz as a play-finisher.More than 20 percent of his offensive possessions come as spot-ups, on which he owns an effective field-goal percentage of 58.4—a top-10 mark among everyone who has gotten off at least 200 field-goal attempts in these situations. He's also shooting a rock-solid 45.4 percent on 9.1 drives per game.Occasional returns to self-creation separate Bogdanovic from other accessory scorers. He shouldn't really be the focal point of any lineup, but he can get to his desired spots coming around screens and is putting in 39.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers.Utah's playoff stock now needs Mike Conley to be Mike Conley more than ever. Bogdanovic underwent season-ending surgery to repair a right wrist injury, and without him, the Jazz are in the same predicament they found themselves in last year: absent a decided No. 2.  63. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersEvaluating Tobias Harris' season against the five-year, $180 million max deal he signed over the offseason would be unfair to him. He isn't playing up to that contract, but the Sixers aren't paying him to. Last year's market gave him leverage. Philly's still-mysterious breakup with Jimmy Butler gave him more.Harris actually has performed up to snuff following a rocky start to the year. He's averaging 20.0 points and 3.1 points while swishing 39.1 percent of his threes since Nov. 15.For all the Sixers' offensive clumpiness, they've fared quite well when Harris sets up shop at power forward—lineup combinations they have at the same time fielded more than you think and not nearly enough. (Translation: What is Al Horford doing in Philly?) His defense has also been pleasantly solid, even relative to the less-squirmy assignments he pulls by seeing so much time between some combination of Josh Richardson, Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle.If Harris is guilty of anything, it's of not being Jimmy Butler. He doesn't foment the same defensive discord when working off the dribble and, by extension, cannot lug the burden of an entire half-court offense for long stretches or during crunch time. His job is made that much harder by the Sixers' wonky roster construction. That he's not higher is on his limitations as a three-level scorer, and on Philly for not putting him in a better spot.  62. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsKitchen-sink metrics are love, love, loving Will Barton's season. He grades out as a fringe top-50 player when looking at his average rank across six catch-alls. That clearly overestimates his impact, but it also isn't flat-out egregious.Lineup composition accounts for some of Barton's advanced-stat good fortune, particularly as it pertains to his defense.He keeps his fouls in check, and opponents have shot just 14-of-37 against him in isolation (38.0 percent), but Gary Harris usually spares him from covering the toughest wing assignment. And more than that, he's constantly on the floor with the rest of the Denver Nuggets' best players. As Jared Dubin wrote for FiveThirtyEight in December:\"Barton contributes at a considerably above-average level across a wide variety of categories on both offense and defense, and crucially, he’s doing so almost exclusively in the context of really good lineups. He’s been on the floor for 1,778 possessions this season, per PBPStats.com, and of those possessions, he has had at least three of Denver’s four other regular starters alongside him for 1,402 of them—a rate of 78.9 percent. That may not make Barton the eighth-'best' player in the NBA, but it does shed light on why a plus-minus statistic like RAPTOR thinks so highly of his contributions this season.\"The statistical dap Barton keeps receiving isn't all due to convenience. He's been huge for the Nuggets. After a right hip injury bilked much of his offensive mojo last season, he's back to capitalizing on life as the third wheel to Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray.Way more of Barton's looks are coming at the rim (35 percent) relative to 2018-19 (28 percent). His finishing around the basket isn't great (41st percentile), and he doesn't draw a ton of shooting fouls, but he's a reliable playmaker off the ball. His 1.22 points per spot-up possession rank in the 90th percentile, and he's converted 86.8 percent of his scoring opportunities off cuts (33-of-38). Denver can largely count on him to make the right pass when attacking closeouts.Doing a little in a lot of different areas adds up. Gordon Hayward, Brandon Ingram, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Karl-Anthony Towns are the only other players averaging over 15 points, three assists and six rebounds while knocking down at least 37 percent of their threes.  61. Ricky Rubio, Phoenix SunsRicky Rubio has lent a sense of two-way steadiness to the oft-wayward Suns. His inclination to push the ball keeps teammates hustling in transition, he's one of the league's best set passers, and Phoenix's rollers and cutters work that much harder knowing he'll find them. That he promises a measure of consistent backcourt defense is no less indispensable.Like always, though, Rubio's limitations come back to haunt him. His three-point clip is actually benefiting from a late-season boom, but he remains a non-threat to score off the dribble.Dubious range and passive shot volume make it difficult for him to headline lineups without another primary option. Plopping him beside a cast of players with finite floor games themselves during those minutes only exacerbates the issue. The Suns are finding out firsthand. They rank in the 2nd percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he plays without Devin Booker.60. Derrick Favors, New Orleans PelicansDerrick Favors is easy to miss among bigs with more bedecked offensive tricks. His three-point volume and efficiency never took off, and mid-range jumpers have been almost entirely weeded out of his arsenal over the past two seasons. Playing him can come at an opportunity cost if the offense doesn't have the spacing to milk his rolls to the basket or the flexibility to let him hunt second-chance points.New Orleans has done a nice job of establishing his fit, even when he plays with Zion Williamson at the 4. The team's guards ceaselessly push the ball in transition, and putting pressure on the rim is of the utmost importance. And it works.The Pelicans are fortunate it does. They can't afford not to play Favors. The same was true for the Utah Jazz. It would remain true if he were part of another team. His defensive presence is tone-setting. He is a back-line quarterback, and what he lacks in the fast-twitch department, he makes up for with court awareness.Targeting Favors on switches is seldom an effective ploy. He stays in front of ball-handlers, won't bite on head-fakes and has the lateral gait to remain attached at the hip when they do put their heads down. It is no accident New Orleans went from 26th in defensive efficiency through its first 25 games while Favors was dealing with injuries to eighth since. Other players face tougher assignments—mainly on the wings—but he is the backbone that keeps the half-court integrity intact.     59. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles ClippersRelentless is the word that best encapsulates Montrezl Harrell's court presence. He is neither an exceptional rebounder nor rim protector, but his game knows only one gear: light speed.Harrell will out-talent few of his opponents. He'll outwork almost all of them. His pick-and-roll synergy with Lou Williams is well-documented, but his finishing has more layers than that two-man connection. He will bruise his way to buckets in the post on one possession and then finagle his way to the basket, off the dribble, on the next.Someone who checks in at 6'7\" shouldn't be so apt at getting through and over bigger opponents. Harrell merges force with finesse in a way defenses can't quite contain. And the surety with which he carries himself—he isn't shy about finishing plays while logging time beside superstars and primary ball-handlers galore—has secured his transition from a per-minute superhero to a higher-volume, per-game weapon.To wit: Antetokounmpo and Jokic are the only other players averaging more than 18 points while shooting better than 59 percent on twos. Harrell's scoring opportunities are more elementary than theirs in the macro but no less overwhelming.  58. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksBrook Lopez is so much more than his missed wide-open threes. And make no mistake: He's missing a bunch of wide-open threes. Among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 triples with a defender six or more feet away, his 29.2 percent clip ranks...124th.Volume and reputation help Lopez's floor-spacing value. He has made threes at a higher rate in the past and takes enough of them that defenses are drawn outside the paint. He mitigates his shaky shooting even further by peppering in some nifty drives. He has the handle to get around opposing bigs without an up-fake, and the in-between touch to put down looks on the move.Post-ups also remain a reliable part of his bag. He's averaging 1.08 points per possession in these situations (87th percentile). Functionally, then, he's still a threat from all over the floor.Lopez's defensive utility takes care of the rest. If he's not matchup-proof, he's pretty damn close. Where many of the switchiest bigs depend on side-to-side burst, he uses wide, low-to-the-ground stances.Smaller, quicker ball-handlers are hard-pressed to get around his length, and he is a case-specific virtuoso. The amount of space he leaves between face-up scorers varies by a player's strength—his speed, his outside touch, his willingness to pull up off the dribble, etc.When being challenged by Lopez at the rim, opponents are shooting 46.9 percent—a top-three mark among 67 players who defend at least four such looks per game. Rival offenses are getting to the basket less and taking more of their shots from mid-range with him on the floor, a direct result of his capability in space.Demanding he receive Defensive Player of the Year consideration goes a touch too far, but over the past two seasons, Lopez has indeed entrenched himself as one of the league's most impactful defenders.  57. Steven Adams, Oklahoma City ThunderSteven Adams doesn't get the usage of old-school bigs, but everything else about him screams throwback.He's resisted the three-point revolution. He's a banger on the boards. And he doesn't need credit for team success, even though the Oklahoma City Thunder's net rating is 2.7 points better when he's on the floor.His 10.9 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.1 blocks and 0.9 steals per game might sound modest, but that has at least a little to do with his playing time. Per 75 possessions, he has produced 14.8 points, 12.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.2 steals. His 3.2 box plus/minus ranks 25th in the NBA, regardless of position.This is where advanced numbers come in handy. Adams, despite his lack of a jump shot and highlight-reel handles, has an impact on games as wide as his shoulders. He does a bit of everything. And his basketball IQ makes him an ideal gap-filler.\"I [don't] think people know how smart he is,\" former teammate Enes Kanter said of Adams, per Forbes' Nick Crain. \"I think he is one of the most influential, educated and smart people. He is probably the smartest basketball player I have ever played with or against.\"Adams always appears to be in the right place on the defensive end. He's a good roller in half-court sets, with a points-per-possession average that ranks in the 79th percentile on those plays, even without the top-of-the-backboard athleticism of players like Jarrett Allen or a prime DeAndre Jordan.He isn't likely to threaten for an All-Star selection, but Adams may be this position's quintessential glue guy.  56. Lonzo Ball, New Orleans PelicansPutting Lonzo Ball outside the top 50 feels wrong—not indefensible, but a little off. He turned a corner at the end of December and hasn't looked back. His averages across that 31-game stretch: 14.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.5 assists and 1.6 steals, which he's amassing while downing 41.0 percent of his threes.And yet, what Ball does for the Pelicans goes way beyond his numbers.He is their offensive intercessor, the playmaker most adept at negotiating everyone's fit next to one another. New Orleans needs someone who defaults to pass-first alongside so many ball-handlers and questionable shooters. Ball keeps the transition attack humming and everyone else's time of possession in proportion to the rest of the lineup.His significance is perhaps most telltale in the partnership he's forged with Zion Williamson. Forget that Ball has assisted on almost one-third of the rookie's baskets. The Pelicans seldom dare to play Zion without him. More than 73 percent of the possessions he's logged have come beside Ball, the ideal intermediary for anyone who, as of now, isn't in the business of creating his own shots beyond putbacks.55. Serge Ibaka, Toronto RaptorsThe evolution of Serge Ibaka probably tracks pretty close to that of the center position, generally. Over his first three seasons, he attempted just six threes. Over his first six seasons, he averaged 0.7 three-point attempts and a league-leading 2.6 blocks.In 2019-20, Ibaka is averaging a career-high 16.0 points and hitting 39.8 percent of 3.3 three-point attempts per game. For the first time in his career, he has produced less than a block per game.Ibaka is a completely different player than he was at the outset of his career. And his ability to space the floor from the 5 opens up the paint for slashing from players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam.When all three are on the floor, the Raptors outscore opponents by 8.8 points per 100 possessions and post a defensive rating that ranks in the 92nd percentile.Ibaka is a more offensively oriented player than he was early in his career, but that doesn't mean he can't still defend. In those aforementioned lineups, he and Siakam are both able to cover the inside or switch onto smaller players on the perimeter. Their combined length helps to make up for the lack of size from a backcourt that includes the 6'0\" Lowry and 6'1\" Fred VanVleet.      54. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsFew players embody the argument for advanced stats better than Marcus Smart. For the fifth time in six NBA seasons, he's posting a below-average effective field-goal percentage. He's putting up a career high in scoring, but 13.5 isn't a number that leaps off the screen. Across the board, his basic numbers look relatively modest.But when you watch the Boston Celtics play, it's abundantly clear that Smart is one of those \"does all the little things\" guys. He can reliably guard four positions (sometimes five, depending on the opponent). He never takes a play off. He makes smart reads as a playmaker. And he doesn't demand a ton of touches on offense.That's all been true in 2019-20. Boston's net rating is 0.5 points per 100 possessions better with Smart on the floor.   53. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeMar DeRozan's net impact is under siege, even more so than it was last summer. His is a distressed value. He does everything deemed most important—initiating offense for both himself and others—but the terms of his engagement are so outmoded that they leave an imprint only under specific circumstances.The good remains really good. DeRozan is an intuitive scorer and passer out of the pick-and-roll. He can still manipulate defenses with his change of pace, and teams usually fawn over No. 1 options forever under control.Just seven other players are averaging more than 20 points and five assists while matching DeRozan's true shooting percentage, a list that mostly reads like a who's who of top-25 stars: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Not all efficient offense is created equal, though. DeRozan is getting to the rim more often and ranks inside the 99th percentile of shooting foul percentage, but he's still a blemish on his team's spacing. Almost two-thirds of his field-goal attempts come from mid-range, and the San Antonio Spurs don't even bother having him shoot threes.Star scorers deserve certain liberties. The mid-range isn't dead so much as readily available only to a select few, DeRozan among them. He creates enough of his own shots and, this season, hits enough of his in-between looks to let them fly.Building an entire offense around someone who plays this way is still tough. Like three-pointers, mid-range jumpers are high-variance, but with a lower payoff. Living on them is a fragile existence. It is even more tenuous when a team doesn't generate the spacing necessary to ensure those looks are of the best possible quality.DeRozan wrestled with the slimmest of margins until LaMarcus Aldridge started bombing more threes. And even since then, the Spurs have been 3.7 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor. (His defense is a problem.)Certain teams have the requisite shooting to optimize DeRozan. But to what end? Tailoring rosters around floor-raisers is always a nebulous venture, and as the gap between what DeRozan does best and what the league values most continues to widen, his ability to lift up a postseason contender will only wane.   52. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsPaul Millsap's role is nowhere near what it was during his All-Star campaigns with the Atlanta Hawks. He's 35 years old and playing 24.4 minutes per game (his lowest average since 2007-08). He is fifth among Denver Nuggets with 500-plus minutes in usage percentage.There's no question he's entered a role-player phase of his career, but he's undoubtedly making the most of the playing time he gets.On the season, Denver is plus-11.1 points per 100 possessions with Millsap on the floor and minus-1.4 with him off, giving him a 12.5-point net rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.He remains a Swiss Army knife of a defender who can bother multiple positions and rebound at a solid rate. And even alongside Nikola Jokic, he posts a solid assist rate for a big.Put everything together, and Millsap once again finds himself in a small club. Only five players match or exceed his marks for rebounding percentage, assist percentage, block percentage and steal percentage in 2019-20.Of course, those are rate stats, though. If anything is starting to go for Millsap, it's durability. He only played 38 games in his first season in Denver. And he has had a difficult time staying on the floor this season.\"The biggest mark against him is the missed time,\" Ryan Blackburn wrote for Denver Stiffs. \"The starting power forward only played 41 of a possible 65 games, missing 21 on the season and 16 in a row at one point. That’s difficult for any team to overcome, and in a shortened season, missing roughly one out of every three games makes life difficult on the rest of the team.\"The Nuggets have played like legitimate title contenders when Millsap has been on the floor this season. He is the perfect gap filler in lineups with stars like Jokic and Jamal Murray. They just need him to fill those gaps in a few more games.   51. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersThe 2019-20 campaign has been something of a renaissance for Kevin Love. Last season, he appeared in just 22 games and posted his lowest box plus/minus since 2012-13.This season, he is averaging 17.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and a career-high 2.6 threes in just 31.8 minutes per game. Adjust those numbers for pace and playing time and they jump up to 20.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 3.0 threes per 75 possessions.And he has posted those numbers on a team generally dominated by guard play. Collin Sexton leads the team in usage, and Darius Garland and Kevin Porter are above 20 percent. Cleveland were 22nd in potential assists when the season was suspended.That led to viral moments of frustration like this one, wherein he threw his arms up at Sexton during a possession, demanded the ball, then two-hand chucked it Cedi Osman before stomping toward halfcourt.In January, though, Love expressed remorse over this and other moments from a difficult season.\"I wasn't acting like a 31-year-old, I was acting like a 13-year-old,\" Love told reporters. \"That was not me.\"He was the veteran presence the young Cavs needed from that practice on. Prior to that admission, he averaged 16.4 points. Afterward, he scored 19.0 per game.It remains to be seen whether that was enough to reinvigorate his trade value. Love's current deal takes him through 2022-23, which will be his age-34 season. He's set to make a whopping $91.5 million over those three years.That's a huge commitment, but a team that fancies itself \"one piece away\" may look at the last few weeks of Love's 2019-20 and think he's the floor-spacing, solid-passing big who'll put it over the top.After two decades of dominance, it's been a rough couple of years for the San Antonio Spurs. But as long as LaMarcus Aldridge is on the floor, they still score.Since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, San Antonio has put up 116.3 points and outscored opponents by 2.0 points per 100 possessions when Aldridge plays without DeMar DeRozan (the Spurs score 112.3 points per 100 possessions and are a minus-1.2 when both share the floor).When Aldridge is the focal point, the offense generally hums. And that especially became true after he fully embraced the three for the first time in his career.From Dec. 23 to the start of the hiatus, Aldridge averaged 4.2 three-point attempts per game and shot 41.6 percent from deep. Over the same stretch, the Spurs scored 115.4 points per 100 possessions with Aldridge on the floor and 111.3 with him off.Becoming a full-blown stretch 5 could add years to Aldridge's career. In the right situation, this newfound willingness to spread the floor could make things easier for the rest of a lineup.Defensively, Aldridge is posting a career-high 1.6 blocks per game, but the Spurs are terrible on that end when he plays, regardless of whether he's with DeRozan.On the season, San Antonio's 113.4 points allowed per 100 possessions rank 24th in the NBA. And that mark gets worse by 2.4 points when Aldridge plays.Still, if he were surrounded by better perimeter defenders, there's a world in which Aldridge is a very impactful modern 5.Being the No. 1 pick in a 2018 draft class that included Luka Doncic and Trae Young is a tough hand to be dealt. The chances that Deandre Ayton ever tops the hype surrounding either, especially Doncic, are slim. But if you just judge Ayton on his merits, he's off to a heck of a start.After a 25-game suspension, he averaged 19.0 points, 12.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 33.2 minutes per game before the hiatus. On the season, the Suns are plus-0.7 points per 100 possessions with Ayton on the floor and minus-2.9 with him off.His 57.1 true shooting percentage eclipsed the league average, but not by much. That's likely the next frontier for Ayton. More trips to the line would help. A player with his size (6'11\", 250 lbs) and athleticism shouldn't be averse to contact.He could use some work on defense, as well, but the Suns' defensive rating is better when he plays. And the nearly two blocks per game is nothing to sneeze at. Ayton is already a sturdier anchor than many projected he'd be by his second year, but he doesn't strike fear into opposing slashers.Of course, for a sophomore, this is almost nitpicky. What Ayton's done with the start of his career is unusual. Tim Duncan, Blake Griffin, Shaquille O'Neal and Towns are the only players in league history to match or exceed his career averages for points (17.1) and rebounds (10.8) through an age-21 season.Malcolm Brogdon's first season with the Indiana Pacers began with a wave of exceeded expectations. The dribble penetration that shone so bright with the Milwaukee Bucks was in full bloom, only it looked much more impressive coming amid skimpier spacing and at higher volume. He was hitting threes, unloading a spruced-up off-the-dribble two and dropping dimes to teammates against defenses he himself scrambled.Some of these good vibes have persisted.He's hitting 50.3 percent of his pull-up twos for the season, and even as the speed at which he probes has gone down, his dribble drives continue to create opportunities for orbiting shooters and those hovering closer to the basket. But injuries have given way to inconsistency, and it can be tough to watch. As Indy Cornrows' Caitlin Cooper noted on the Hardwood Knocks podcast:\"His drives dropped quite a bit. His free-throw attempts bottomed out. His free-throw percentage dropped by a pretty big margin as well. And you noticed that he didn't really look like he was moving super well on either end of the floor. He's not a great point of attack to defender to begin with, but even when he was off the ball and had to help to the nail, he just looked stiff and brittle. Maybe this [quad] injury that he has, I don't know if that was something that was bothering him before, or what was going on.\"But obviously, his three-point shot hasn't necessarily carried over from Milwaukee either. He's down in the low 30s overall, and he's taking tougher threes—more pull-up threes and more contested threes as a product of no longer being a spot-up guy next to Giannis [Antetokounmpo] anymore. And [Victor] Oladipo isn't really there to generate that type of gravity.\"Writing off Brogdon's midseason spiral as the offshoot of injury woes is fair. Whiffing on contested, off-the-bounce three-pointers is one thing. Missing higher-quality looks is more problematic. Brogdon is finding nylon on just 31.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot triples and hitting only 28.8 percent of his wide-open long balls—the second-worst mark among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 uncontested threebies.Indiana needs him to knock down those looks to facilitate the fit with Oladipo. Brogdon's hot start, responsibility within the Pacers offense and raw numbers (16.3 points 7.1 assists per game) are enough to float top-50 placement for now, but he's primed for a decline if a cleaner bill of health doesn't render him more of a constant.Jamal Murray is at the same time an offensive standout and a source of concern for the Denver Nuggets.Twenty-three-year-old point guards can play with his level of bravado, but few in his age bracket can parlay that bluster into substance. That Murray can transition so effectively from playing off Nikola Jokic to breaking down defenses in the half court is a functional virtue, and he has already shown he can turn the tides of a playoff game.The importance of his off-the-dribble jumper increases tenfold versus the stingiest defenses and during crunch time in general.Handing him the offensive keys without Jokic is still touch-and-go. The Nuggets place in the 46th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he runs solo—neither terrible nor average. This might say more about the lineups in which he plays during these stretches. Suboptimal spacing is a problem in many of the ancillary combinations.Denver needn't place too much stock in these Jokic-less returns...yet. Maintaining an average offense without one of the game's seven best offensive engines on the court is supposed to be a chore...for now. But these safety-net caveats won't last forever.After signing a five-year max extension last July, Murray is about to be paid like a star. The Nuggets don't have clear access to sustained title contention if he doesn't turn into a comparable sidekick for Jokic. Murray has his moments, but those displays aren't yet stasis. He too often disappears in the backdrop. At the very least, he hasn't made an appreciable leap.Check out his per-36 splits over the past three seasons:Right down to his shot distribution, Murray looks eerily similar to the player of the past three seasons. And while that's still good enough to scrap for a top-50 billing, a top-50 billing isn't good enough for what Denver's paying him to be.Spencer Dinwiddie's field-goal percentage, three-point percentage and free-throw percentage have seen fairly significant declines this season. Who knew that D'Angelo Russell was such a safety net?Still, the Brooklyn Nets muster just 102.5 points per 100 possessions when Dinwiddie is off the floor. For context's sake, the Golden State Warriors' league-worst offense scores 104.9 points per 100 possessions.When Dinwiddie is in the game, that number has jumped to 111.8, giving him an offensive rating swing that ranks in the 97th percentile.Despite the inefficiency on his own shots, Dinwiddie's presence on the floor makes things easier for everyone else. He has commanded plenty of defensive attention as the No. 1 option for all but the 20 games Kyrie Irving played and is a willing passer when that attention overwhelms. His career-high 6.8 assists lead the team.Stephen Curry and James Harden are the only players in NBA history with seasons in which they've matched or exceeded D'Angelo Russell's 2019-20 averages for assists (7.0) and threes (3.9) per 75 possessions.His ability to drag defenders well outside the three-point line opens things up for teammates with both the Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves. But it still feels like we've yet to see the fully realized Russell.Perhaps the pick-and-roll (or, more likely, pick-and-pop) game with he and Karl-Anthony Towns will do the trick. Sure, that same duo is a likely target for opponents on the other end of the floor, but it'll be a nightmare to cover.Russell has a sub-50 effective field-goal percentage on shots off the dribble this season, but defenses aren't able to load up on him when Towns is the one setting ball screens. And if the guard has his matchup on an island, he'll do plenty of damage.Zach LaVine's place relative to the rest of the league remains in flux. Someone who clears 25 points per game while nailing nearly 50 percent of his twos and 38 percent of his threes is clearly good, but the degree to which he can impact winning isn't yet known. Billing him as an empty-calories scorer is more than a touch too bold. LaVine's numbers are not solely the offshoot of unchecked volume. He has meaningful layers to his game.Anyone who can reliably find nylon on off-the-bounce threes is an asset, and LaVine has drilled 36.4 percent of his pull-up triples on top-15 volume. Junky twos aren't as prevalent in his offensive armory anymore, and he has appreciably increased his point-blank frequency over the past two seasons.Figuring out whether LaVine's production elevates those around him is where things get tricky. He is fine as a complementary playmaker but overstretched as anything more. And his off-the-bounce triples, while impressive, often seem less necessary and more the result of over-dribbling.This wouldn't matter if the Chicago Bulls were winning, or if LaVine guaranteed an average offense. They're not, and he doesn't.Chicago scores nearly four points more per 100 possessions with him on the court (80th percentile), but that jump is still only good for an offensive rating in the 28th percentile. LaVine isn't Devin Booker or Trae Young, two lifelines on losing teams who redefine their offense's ceiling. He's more of a floor-preserver—the kind of player who'd be a lot better off as the Bulls' No. 2.Gordon Hayward has finally settled into a new normal following the devastating compound left leg fracture and dislocated left ankle he suffered on opening night of the 2017-18 season. He is both better and more consistent than he was last year, his comfort level perhaps most evident in the ease and frequency with which he dribbles into turnarounds and fadeways that require him to spin or stop on a dime.At the same time, Hayward is visibly different.This is not the might-be All-NBA candidate the Boston Celtics signed in 2017. He has never put a ton of pressure on the rim, but he's at least slightly more reserved when attacking from advantageous positions in space. His presence at the foul line was on the modest end to begin with and has since been slashed. He's averaging a career-low 2.7 free throws per 36 minutes.Moving beyond what Hayward was versus what he is now isn't particularly hard. Boston has been unable to buy time on offense when he plays without Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker, and he's on the books for superstar money, but his shift in status post-injury isn't dire. He's still an effective, efficient player.Hayward is shooting a remarkable 55.3 percent inside the arc, including 53.6 percent on pull-up two-pointers. He ranks in the 91st percentile of efficiency on spot-up possessions, which account for nearly 20 percent of his offense. When he does get to the rim, he's converting at a 69.0 percent clip (89th percentile).The Celtics can't expect him to carry entire lineups, but they can count on his two-man game with Daniel Theis, tidy drop-offs to shooters and wicked-fast post entry passes.Viewed in its totality, Hayward's contribution falls well shy of stardom. His numbers—17.3 points and 4.1 assists per game with a 59.3 true shooting percentage—put him in esteemed company, but neither his responsibility nor volume is the same. It may never be.That's fine. Because if stardom is off the table, Hayward has already shown he can be the next best thing: high-end support for a championship contender.Fred VanVleet became a full-time starter this season, and he hasn't disappointed. Beyond the career-high 17.6 points he'saveraging, he shot 38.8 percent from three on 7.0 attempts per game. His 6.6 assists per contest have made him one of the game's top secondary creators as part of the Toronto Raptors' two-point-guard attack.But what really sets VanVleet apart from the point guards detailed above is his defense. Despite a listed height of just 6'0\", he manages to make life difficult for opposing 1s by seemingly setting up shop right under their dribble. It's almost like the undersized boxer is working way inside the range of his taller opponent.When he's on the floor, Toronto allows 105.9 points per 100 possessions, a mark that ranks in the 87th percentile. His in-your-face defense on opposing creators is a big reason why.Trae Young understandably gets the most attention of the young Atlanta Hawks, but it's his budding partnership with John Collins that has the potential to make him a winning player.When Young is on the floor with Collins this season, Atlanta is minus-1.7 points per 100 possessions. When he is on the floor without Collins, that number plummets to minus-7.3.A big who can score from the inside and the three-point line is borderline essential in today's NBA. And Collins is exactly that. Whether Young is quarterbacking a pick-and-roll or isolating, Collins is an ideal receiver.His points per possession as a roll man ranks in the 84th percentile this season. And he is shooting 42.5 percent on 3.3 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per game.Collins is much more than the 21.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and highlight-reel dunks you've seen of him. He has the potential to be a thoroughly modern 5 and half of one of the league's best offensive duos.On the other end, Collins certainly isn't bad, but he's not the kind of dominant defender that can cover for the deficiencies of Young. Clint Capela may be that, and Collins is nimble enough to play the 4, but the ideal configuration may be Young, Collins and three switchy wing/forwards.However those lineups are aligned, Atlanta should feel confident that it already has the box checked for a big man with All-Star potential.Eric Bledsoe is one of the league's best among point guards. After making first-team All-Defense in 2019, there is no slippage from him in 2019-20.On the season, the Milwaukee Bucks allow an era-defying 95.3 points per 100 possessions when Bledsoe shares the floor with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Their overall defense, which ranks first in the league by a wide margin, allows 102.3 points per 100 possessions.Like VanVleet, Bledsoe is undersized (6'1\") but unafraid to play in close quarters. With his lateral quickness, he can play a more aggressive brand of defense than most.And his offense isn't too shabby, either. In fact, after a few years alongside the MVP-caliber Giannis, Bledsoe might be a bit underrated on that end. This season, he's averaging 25.4 points and 7.4 assists per 75 possessions with a 58.3 true shooting percentage when Giannis is off the floor.It took him some time to find his basketball legs again, but once he did, Kristaps Porzingis has looked like the ideal big-man complement to Luka Doncic.He had averages of 19.2 points, a career-high 9.5 rebounds and a career-high 2.5 threes when the season was put on hiatus, but his 54.0 true shooting percentage was over two points below the league average.From Jan. 31 up to the suspension, though, he was at 25.2 points, 10.9 rebounds and 3.2 threes with a 60.5 true shooting percentage.After sitting out all of 2018-19 while recovering from a torn ACL, we probably should've expected the slow start, but even when the shots aren't falling, you can see the stylistic fit.\"He's throwing some really cool lob passes to [Dwight] Powell,\" coach Rick Carlisle told reporters in December. \"I mean, you've got a 7'3\" guy throwing to a 6'10\" guy on a lob? That's pretty [expletive] cool if you ask me. Let's get off of all this stuff that KP needs to go in the post. He doesn't. He doesn't. I'm OK with him going in there once in a while, but we don't post anybody.\"Porzingis as a key cog in Dallas' Luka-run offense has worked wonders. The 116.7 points per 100 possessions the Mavericks have scored is an all-time high.But the bigger impact from KP may come on defense. His offensive rating swing is a near-neutral plus-0.1. But opponents score 5.0 fewer points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor. He has a top-10 block percentage this season and leads all Mavs with at least 500 minutes in defensive rebounding rate.If he maintains that sort of defensive impact next season, while playing like he did in the first few months of 2020 on offense, the Mavericks will have one of the game's top duos (if they don't already).Danilo Gallinari is still better than people realize. He is in his third season of posting a 60-plus true shooting percentage, a 35-plus free-throw-attempt rate and a 40-plus three-point-attempt rate, and he's top 70 all time in career offensive box plus/minus. James Harden and Chauncey Billups are the only players with more such seasons.This distinctly modern game has been a staple for Gallinari for years, but it has been particularly effective alongside Chris Paul with the Oklahoma City Thunder. When the two vets share the floor, OKC score at a blistering rate of 120.1 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile).And while CP3 rightfully gets most of the praise for the Thunder's better-than-expected attack—even Gallo said, \"I think he's the best leader that I've played with.\"—the Italian forward deserves plenty of credit.Paul spreads the ball around more than most floor generals, but Gallinari is still his top assist target. And when CP3 plays without Gallo, that offense plummets to a below-average 109.3 points per 100 possessions.That impact has a lot to do with the shooting that forced defenders to watch him outside, but Gallinari brings a lot more offense to the table. His pump-fake-and-go game is top-tier. And he's one of the game's best at identifying disadvantaged defenses and actually moving into a drive before the catch. He's not the most explosive athlete, so even those plays didn't often end with wide-open layups, but he draws plenty of fouls that way. His uber-efficient attack is a critical part of the Thunder's success.On the other end of the floor, he has a harder time overcoming his weaknesses. He's often caught flat-footed on the perimeter. And he doesn't rebound a ton, despite being 6'10\". Both contributed to opponents scoring 8.0 more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, a defensive rating swing that ranks in the fifth percentile.But even with that deep of a hole dug defensively, Gallinari's plus-6.6 net rating swing still ranks in the 85th percentile. That's how much of an impact his offense makes.Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only player who matches or exceeds Nikola Vucevic's averages for points (20.3), rebounds (11.6) and assists (3.8) over the last two seasons.Yes, that Antetokounmpo. The reigning MVP with a good shot to join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.Of course, Antetokounmpo blows away the thresholds set by Vucevic, but the production is plenty impressive nonetheless.Like others on this list, Vucevic has improved his standing in the league by embracing the three-point shot and facilitating from the post. For the first six years of his career, he averaged 2.0 assists and 0.3 three-point attempts per game. Over the last three, those numbers are up to 3.7 and 3.6.And his more evolved game has made him, by far, the most important player on the Orlando Magic.Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, Orlando is plus-1.3 points per 100 possessions with Vucevic on the floor and minus-5.3 with him off. The offensive rating takes a 6.2-point tumble when he sits.When he's on the floor, Vooch commands defensive attention whether in the post or surveying the floor from up top. This, of course, makes things easier for teammates who've struggled to carry offensive responsibility throughout their careers.On the other end of the floor, Vucevic isn't likely to threaten for Defensive Player of the Year anytime soon, but he's done a solid job of piling up counting stats as a member of the Magic. There are only seven players who match or exceed his totals for blocks and steals since he went to Orlando in 2012. And he's had an above-average defensive-rating swing in three of his last four seasons.One of the key differences between Bledsoe and De'Aaron Fox is that the former has the luxury of playing over two-thirds of his total minutes alongside an MVP. His burden is significantly lighter than Fox's, a third-year guard tasked with engineering the offense of a team without an All-Star.Even with the heavy load and an early-season injury that cost him 17 straight games, though, Fox has maintained his career's upward trajectory. He's averaging 20.4 points and 6.8 assists in just 31.7 minutes per game, and he's scored at an above-average rate in isolation and as a pick-and-roll ball-handler.As (or if) Sacramento fills out the roster around Fox with more reliable offensive players, and defenses can afford less focus on the point guard, Fox's ability to attack one-on-one will yield even better overall numbers.Domantas Sabonis' first All-Star campaign has been a doozy.And his basic averages of 18.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 0.8 steals might not even do his production justice.Let's take a look at a pace- and playing time-adjusted comparison to 2013-14 Kevin Love, who finished second in the league in box plus/minus:The key differences, of course, were Love's scoring and the fact that he was hitting threes, but the statistical similarities are unavoidable.The Indiana Pacers have a superstar talent on their team who can score around the rim and from the mid-range. His passing unlocks opportunities for teammates like T.J. Warren, Malcolm Brogdon and Victor Oladipo.And he's almost certainly better defensively than the 25-year-old Love.The Pacers allow 4.8 fewer points per 100 possessions with Sabonis on the floor this season. And that isn't exclusively a function of the time spent with Myles Turner (though it helps). Indiana still defends at an above-average level when Sabonis plays without Turner.He's not a lockdown defender on the perimeter or a lights-out rim protector, but he generally does a decent job of just being in the way. Sometimes, that's enough from a big man. That and his ability to dominate the defensive glass makes Sabonis a plus on that end.Treating Ja Morant as a top-10 point guard and top-30ish player overall is not a rush to coronation. He's earned it.Rookies seldom ferry his workload while sustaining above-average efficiency. Walter Davis, Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and David Robinson are the only other first-year players who have matched his usage (26) and true shooting percentage (56.8).Morant's game is essentially the marriage of flash and substance. His off-the-dribble escapism bends defenses and renders traditional bigs forced to switch or rotate on to him a special kind of helpless. Every dunk attempt is an event—even the missed ones. And though his takeoffs may, on some level, be for the 'gram, they change the way teams must guard him inside the free-throw line.Tremendous downhill touch only complicates the pickle in which Morant puts defenses. He complements his explosion with split-second finesse. Could-be rim assaults are also potential scoop shots. He's hitting 51.3 percent of his floaters.That Morant partners this touch with on-a-whim vision is unfair. He's more of an equal opportunity scorer and facilitator than a points-first engine. His improvisation on the move belies his experience. He might possibly lead the league in assists thrown after leaving his feet.Knowing that Morant has room to improve is scary. Fewer of his passes will go haywire as he gains more reps, and his occasional off-the-dribble three could turn into a moderate- or high-volume staple.Left alone, though, Morant already holds his own against the NBA's best offensive players, and his first season is almost beyond comparison to others. Oscar Robertson and Trae Young are the only other rookies to clear 20 points and eight assists per 36 minutes.CJ McCollum leaves a lot to be desired when viewing his game through the lens of conventional stardom.He doesn't get to the rim or foul line at a high clip and is a coin-toss finisher when he does attack the basket. He has great chemistry with bigs out of the pick-and-roll, can spot shooters while going downhill and boasts great ball control but is overtaxed as the primary setup man.The Portland Trail Blazers offense when he plays without Damian Lillard has only ranked higher than the 38th percentile once over the past five seasons (2015-16).By those measures, McCollum could be overrated, now more so than ever after he signed a three-year, $100 million extension over the summer. But his standing is only compromised insofar as you're still expecting him to be someone else.Portland isn't paying him to be a situational No. 1. He is meant to be the team's No. 2 through and through, a certified buckets-getter who can moonlight as a playmaker but earns his keep by providing cornerstone offense as Lillard's second in command.McCollum has seldom failed to hold up his end of this bargain. He is one of the smoothest scorers alive. It'd be nice if he could swish more off-the-dribble threes, but he doesn't need to lean on outside volume when he wields an automatic in-between game. He is shooting 47 percent from mid-range overall (89th percentile) and keeps defenses guessing with a mix of deadly accurate floaters (45.7 percent) and stop-and-pop twos (50.0 percent).What separates McCollum from, say, Zach LaVine isn't just a matter of opportunity. He's in the ideal role for his skill set, but he's also shown everything he does translates to the playoff pressure cooker. He can still get to his spots in cramped spaces and doesn't receive nearly enough credit for his tough-shot making.That he also collects his 20-plus points per game without significantly eating into the usage of those around him—he's downing 47.1 percent of his catch-and-fire threes—is very on-brand. He's made a career out of effectively straddling the line between star and complement.Struggling through consecutive postseasons did little to slow Donovan Mitchell's hype train. Anyone would be overburdened as his team's sole from-scratch scorer. Every star must have a viable No. 2. The Utah Jazz needed to get Mitchell his.And then they did. Sort of.The Mike Conley acquisition hasn't panned out, but Bojan Bogdanovic and Jordan Clarkson adequately stock Utah's roster with shot-makers, even if they're not letter-of-the-law sidekicks. The offense should be more equipped to handle the postseason crucible because of them, albeit less so following Bogdanovic's season-ending wrist injury. The idea of Conley can still be an asset, too.But Mitchell's numbers aren't yet reflective of the Jazz's sturdier offensive depth. Though his scoring is almost identical to last season's (25.4 points per 36 minutes) and coming on better efficiency, his true shooting percentage (56.0) remains below the league average (56.4). Long twos are, somehow, an even bigger part of his game, and they're coming at the expense of his volume around the rim.Taking fewer shots at the basket has cut into Mitchell's foul-line trips, and he wasn't an especially frequent customer at the charity stripe in the first place. Among the 40 players with a usage rate of 25 or higher, his free-throw-attempt rate ranks 33rd.Keeping his three-point clip above 36 percent is a win, but only a minor one. He's still not knocking down deep balls off the dribble; he's converting just 31.6 percent of his pull-up triples.Age and role ensure Mitchell will remain the Jazz's most important building block. That's different from their most valuable player. Rudy Gobert still holds that honor, and Mitchell hasn't made enough of a jump to suggest that's about to change.Utah is getting slaughtered whenever he plays without the Stifle Tower while posting a crummy offensive rating. This doesn't mean Mitchell is bad. He's not. It does mean he has a long way to go before the Jazz can comfortably declare him the face of the future.All the tricks Shai Gilgeous-Alexander flashed as a rookie have proved to be but a prelude. He is no longer a young prospect ahead of schedule. He's one of the NBA's most underrated scorers.Gilgeous-Alexander has made great use of the extra license the Oklahoma City Thunder have bestowed upon him. His three-point clip is down, but he's stayed above 35 percent while creating more of his own opportunities. Under 10 percent of his made treys came without assists last year. That number has soared up to over 43 percent this season.Exchanging looks at the rim for longer twos is often frowned upon, but the in-between game suits Gilgeous-Alexander. He's knocking down 45.0 percent of his mid-range jumpers (83rd percentile) and splashing in 45.9 percent of his floaters.Endorsing his shot distribution is even easier when it comes with a rising free-throw-attempt rate. He has added more changes in pace and in-and-out dribbles to his repository and is much better at finishing through contact from outside the restricted area.Others will be lower on Gilgeous-Alexander until he brings more oomph as a playmaker. His opportunity is finite beside both Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder, but he continues to look more like a hybrid wing than a combo guard. Oklahoma City's offense has sputtered whenever he plays without Paul, and he's tallied just 109 possessions as the official point guard.As is, though, Gilgeous-Alexander can be the second-best offensive player on a ridiculously good team. And he doesn't necessarily need to approximate floor-general value when he's so darn useful at the other end. He can make life hell on both guard spots and even wing-sized whatevers. The Thunder haven't shied from using him on Ben Simmons- and Brandon Ingram-types.His All-Star peak isn't just in play. It feels inevitable.Somewhat lost amid Jayson Tatum's climb into superstar territory is the humdinger of a season Jaylen Brown has pieced together. He's averaging a career-high 20.4 points per game while downing 38.1 percent of his threes and a gaga 55.2 percent of his twos. After three years of hovering in the mid-60s, his free-throw conversion rate sits at 73.6 percent—on a personal-best 4.6 attempts per 36 minutes, no less.Brown's progress is palpable enough that he generated some All-Star buzz. His failure to make the cut shouldn't be spun into anything too profound, but it does nod to a certain lagging. He's still stereotyped into more of a specialist's box rather than formal stardom.Whether that's unfair is in the eye of the beholder. The Boston Celtics don't yet know if they can win a title with Brown as their third-best player, and he'll always pale in comparison to most of his would-be peers on the offensive end. His is a role rooted more in finishing plays than creating them.Over half of his possessions come as transition or spot-up opportunities, and close to 90 percent of his made threes are assisted. His volume as the pick-and-roll ball-handler has more than doubled from last season, but he doesn't pass enough for the offense to actually run through him, and his handle can get unglued when he's tasked with doing more than attacking decongested lanes.Without a semi-sizable shift in focus, this caps Brown's apex much like it does for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander—in that it's marginally prohibitive but mostly doesn't matter because of the heavy lifting he does at the other end.Boston's three-wing lineups wouldn't be so effective without Brown's defensive bandwidth. He rumbles with power forwards more than Tatum or Gordon Hayward, and only Marcus Smart sees more reps against No. 1 options, according to data from Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu. Brown's presence on the glass is likewise paramount to the Celtics using the good-but-undersized Daniel Theis so freely at the 5.Elite three-and-D specialists have fringe-star value. Brown is more than that. He has a broader offensive responsibility than catch-and-shoot connoisseurs, and his combination of volume and efficiency verges on anomalous. Giannis Antetokounmpo, DeMar DeRozan, Khris Middleton and Brandon Ingram are the only wings who match his scoring, usage and true shooting percentage.If you're thinking this placement is over-ambitious for a 19-year-old rookie who has only played 565 minutes, you're not alone. Even the writers behind this project struggled with the idea of Zion Williamson already being a top-four power forward.But his numbers leap off the screen about as explosively as the player himself leaves the hardwood.The New Orleans Pelicans' net points per 100 possessions is 12.2 points better with Zion on the floor, a swing that ranks in the 97th percentile and adds an estimated 29 wins to the team's expectancy over an 82-game slate.His 27.5 points per 75 possessions is the second-highest mark for a rookie since 1973-74 (as far back as per-possession data goes), just behind Joel Embiid in 2016-17 and just ahead of 1984-85 Michael Jordan.Zion's 62.4 true shooting percentage ranks first among rookies who logged a 25-plus usage percentage over the same span. Arvydas Sabonis (who was 31 during his rookie season) and David Robinson (24) wind up the top three.As far as scoring and impact go, Williamson pretty clearly justifies his position on this list. His feel in both fast breaks and halfcourt sets is way beyond his years. He knows exactly when to cut and sees lanes opening up seemingly ahead of time. His second jump is absurd, maybe even on par with a prime Shawn Marion, whose playing weight was 60-plus pounds lighter.Offensively, the next steps for Zion are probably a more consistent jump shot and a bit more playmaking for others. But even without those things, he's already a devastating offensive weapon.He needs a lot more work on the other end. His focus there seems to come and go far too often. His block and steal rates from college haven't yet translated. And it feels like he should be gobbling up more defensive rebounds. But we have to remember that he's a rookie. And he's a 19-year-old rookie. The learning curve for NBA defenders is steep.What's clear is that he has the physical tools to dominate defensively. His basketball IQ on offense suggests he should be able to pick up the concepts necessary to be a plus on both sides of the ball. But even if he doesn't live up to his potential as a defender and becomes, say, average on that end, his offense would still make him a mainstay at the top of lists like this.Brandon Ingram has come of role this season. Beforehand, he was the silhouette of an offensive hub, but only for stretches at a time, usually toward the end of the schedule. This year, on a new team that has given him more creative agency, he's been a wire-to-wire force.His All-Star selection speaks for itself, even though it came during a down year for Western Conference wings. His numbers say even more: 24.3 points and 4.3 assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 59.0—benchmarks that, prior to this year, have only ever been hit by one player in his age-22-or-younger season. That player's name? Michael Jordan.Friendlier circumstances (and a cleaner health bill) aren't solely responsible for Ingram's ascent. He has both broadened and refined his game.He's always had a knack for reaching his spots on-ball and making plays at the rim, but his finishing lagged elsewhere. He now wields a more consistent touch between 10 and 16 feet and a more willing trigger finger from beyond the arc. Both his three-point and free-throw clips have exploded relative to his career average.What's most impressive about Ingram's arrival isn't the leap itself but its endurance. His improvement has not only spanned the entire season, but it's also survived two different iterations of the New Orleans Pelicans: pre-Zion Williamson and post-Zion Williamson.Slightly lower usage beside Zion has not rattled Ingram. He's been money in catch-and-shoot situations (60.2 effective field-goal percentage), and his true shooting percentage has dropped without plummeting when they share the floor. Encouraging still, across a 704-possession sample, New Orleans owns a plus-14.6 net rating with Ingram and Zion manning the 3 and 4, respectively.This is not a small development. Ingram's success as part of a larger operation, one that doesn't always default to him, was never a given. Deference can throw players off balance.Ingram himself still has kinks to work out next to Zion, but the early returns suggest his leap is at once permanent and, just as important, generally adaptable.Any lingering urges to loop Devin Booker into the empty-stats brigade need to be stamped out. That stance was always hyperbolic. Youth needs time to marinate, and the Phoenix Suns never put enough NBA talent around him to infer a correlation between him and their downtrodden record.They still haven't. The Suns are much better off than they were in 2018-19 when Booker wanted for the most fundamental ball-handling support. But the core he headlines now still isn't perfectly designed to simplify his role or guarantee palatable proximity to the Western Conference playoff picture.Adding Ricky Rubio is a start. Booker is no longer Phoenix's only primary playmaker. But he remains its most influential one. The Suns rank in the 79th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when Booker is on the floor. That efficiency bottoms out to the 2nd percentile in the minutes Rubio plays without him. (Phoenix's offense is in the 33rd percentile when Booker runs the show on his own.)What little relief Booker has received—mainly from Rubio, career-year Kelly Oubre Jr. and Deandre Ayton—looks awfully good on him. His efficiency has been on the come-up for most of his career, and he's reached yet another new height this season.Among the 58 non-bigs who have played at least 1,000 minutes and are averaging at least 15 points, Booker's true shooting percentage ranks fourth, behind Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton and Davis Bertans. He's on pace to become the 10th player to clear 25 points and five assists per game with a true shooting percentage higher than 61, joining James Harden (six times), LeBron James (six times), Michael Jordan (four times), Stephen Curry (three times), Kevin Durant (three times), Larry Bird (twice), Giannis Antetokounmpo (twice), Isaiah Thomas and Lillard.Between his continuously improving feel for jump-starting an offense, multilevel scoring and the ability to leverage touch and cutting without the ball, Booker is now, without question, one of the league's most impactful players.Bam Adebayo may embody the future of the center position more than anyone on this list. He has the size (6'9\", 255 pounds) to play the 5, but he can be trusted to switch onto any position, handle the ball, facilitate, finish inside and even do a little damage in the floater zone.On the season, he's averaging a well-rounded 16.2 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.2 steals per game. The only thing left is three-point range. And that may be on the way. According to ESPN's Zach Lowe, he went 31-of-50 on corner threes in a predraft workout for the Miami Heat.In an increasingly positionless NBA, guys who can do everything will reign.Michael Pina wrote for SB Nation:\"When [the Heat] look at Adebayo they don't see a position, and even before they took him 14th overall in the 2017 draft they didn't see a prospect who should be boxed into a role. Adebayo is an original, one-of-one — a jittery ball of unselfish, peerlessly athletic energy whose lone hobby is discovering new ways to dismantle traditional norms on a basketball court.\"On the season, 16 players have taken at least 10 shots when defended by Adebayo. They vary from point guards like Markelle Fultz, Russell Westbrook and Spencer Dinwiddie, to wings like Bradley Beal, to bigs like Joel Embiid and Nikola Vucevic. Only two of those 16 shot at least 50 percent against Bam. And Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, was 8-of-23 (34.8 percent).The tenacity and versatility of Adebayo makes him an ideal defensive anchor for the Heat, alongside Jimmy Butler. But his potential on the offensive end may be every bit as tantalizing.Adebayo isn't just making run-of-the-mill kick-outs from the post for his assists. He's passing on the move, out of rolls, from the top of the key or the elbow. He's comfortable passing with either hand. And his vision may be better than any big man's, save Jokic's.The next evolution for this position is \"point center.\" Jokic has been doing that for a while with the Nuggets. Adebayo brings significantly more athleticism to the equation.Jrue Holiday is the same as ever: damn good and underappreciated.Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson have all taken turns overshadowing him on offense, which is to be expected. They're new and shiny, and Holiday has almost always blurred the line between primary option and complement. But his role hasn't actually changed all that much alongside the New Orleans Pelicans' most prominent additions.Sure, his usage is slightly down. And yes, he's taking the occasional extra standstill jumper. For the most part, though, he remains New Orleans' offensive engine.No one on the team runs more pick-and-rolls per game, and rather than ween off his self-creation, he's steered further into it. He looks more comfortable dancing with the ball in his hands and is churning through an almost identical number of pull-up jumpers compared to last season. More of his made threes are actually going unassisted (44.3 percent, up from 40.7), and he continues to bust out his step-back jumper.Plenty of scorers shoot higher clips, but Holiday is efficient enough relative to his role. He's hitting more than 50.0 percent of his two-pointers and within striking distance of league-average accuracy from distance (35.7 percent) while putting up nearly 20 points and seven assists per game.Demands to drop Holiday further likely don't properly value his defense. The idea that he's not as much of a neutralizer is, frankly, a little absurd—like his job description.Just look at the six players he's spent the most time guarding: Luka Doncic, LeBron James, CJ McCollum, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Damian Lillard and Devin Booker. I mean, my goodness. Difficult assignments don't equate to good defense, but Holiday is the exhaustive ball hawk the Pelicans stick on the very best without sending him much help.Finding another player who bears his burden at both ends is almost impossible. Two-way primary usage, a metric developed by Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu, measures the amount of time a player spends as the No. 1 option on offense while guarding the other team's No. 1 scorer. Ben Simmons is the only player in the league with a higher two-way workload than Holiday.Sharing the offensive workload with fellow star teammates and a quality supporting cast looks good on Kemba Walker. It would look even better if left knee problems didn't cost him a chunk of the season.Sticking him this low could come off as an insult. It isn't. It is more so a nod to the league's depth of star power—especially at point guard. Eight floor generals are in front of him, and with the exception of the top two or three, Walker has an argument to be ahead of everyone else. Welcome to the world of splitting hairs.On the surface, Walker is not a material upgrade over Kyrie Irving for the Boston Celtics. He is scoring at a lower and less efficient clip, and their average touch time is about the same. Walker is actually controlling the ball for longer per possessions than 2018-19 Irving.The bigger, more important difference lies in Walker's usage. He is a better complement than Irving to the rest of Boston's roster, a comfier fit who has paved the way for Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward to do more.Fewer of Walker's buckets are coming off assists (36 percent) compared to his predecessor (37.3 percent), but he works in isolation much less. Both may be similar in how long they hold onto the ball, but Walker burns through fewer touches overall. And it is Walker who gives more consistent damns on defense.Mind you, ceding touches to his supporting cast and status to Tatum has not dulled Walker's star quality. He is the Celtics' best pick-and-roll initiator, leading the team in crunch-time usage rate and draining 36.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers, which he launches more often than everyone in the league except for Luka Doncic, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Tatum's ascent has rendered him Boston's most valuable player, but Walker still has claim to the team's offensive crown. The Celtics are scoring a team-high 7.6 points more per 100 possessions with him on the court, during which time their perimeter-shooting efficiency skyrockets.This steadying star power is nothing new. Spending his entire career in Charlotte may have limited his national exposure, but Walker has been this same bracing force for some time. Five-year regularized-adjusted plus-minus ranks him as the sixth-most valuable offensive player since 2015, according to NBA Shot Charts. His role may have shifted in Boston, but he's still clearly among the NBA's very best.Trae Young's detractors needn't reach deep into the bag to find their rebuke: If he's this good, if he's already a top-25 player, why aren't the Atlanta Hawks better? It's a fair question. And Young's defense alone might provide the answer.Catch-all metrics portray him as a certifiable nonfactor at the less glamorous end. He is dead-last in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus and NBA Shot Charts' luck-adjusted defensive regularized adjusted plus-minus. And he ranks third-to-last, ahead of just Bradley Beal and Darius Garland, in NBA Math's defensive points saved.Non-defenders can be tricky cornerstones. They complicate attempts to build contenders. The breadth of Young's offense does not excuse his transgressions at the other end. But it comes pretty damn close.Young's ultra-deep pull-up threes warp entire defenses. Planning for someone who's willing to fire away just inside the timeline is a migraine-and-a-half. Young exacerbates the defense's dilemma by actually making those shots. He's converting 35.8 percent of his looks from 29 feet and out.A lack of size (6'1\") has not hindered his capacity to make plays inside the arc. He has perfected the arc and timing of his floaters and ranks in the 92nd percentile of finishing around the rim. His 9.3 assists per game are not the byproduct of how much time he spends on the ball but an accurate reflection of his vision. He beams one-handed dimes on the move before it's even clear he's picked up his dribble, confuses defenders by telegraphing one pass but throwing another and threads the needle against double-teams he's not supposed to see over.Atlanta's offense is not elite with Young on the floor (54th percentile), but it's subject to a monster drop-off when he sits—an 11.8-point-per-100-possessions plunge that ranks as the third-largest in the league among every player who has cleared 500 minutes.Put a more established supporting cast around Young, and the wins and losses should take care of themselves. He's averaging 29.6 points and 9.3 assists with a 59.5 true shooting percentage as the all-everything of an offense light on polished talent. Adding another ball-handler alone would go a long way, granting him an actual chance to work as a spot-up and motion shooter.In the meantime, he cannot be too harshly penalized for the constraints placed upon him by the circumstances under which he plays. He has outperformed the degree of difficulty attached to his role. So few players have ever balanced his volume with this efficiency—10 in league history, to be more exact: Adrian Dantley (four times); James Harden (four times); Michael Jordan (three times); Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (two times); Kevin Durant (two times); Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Karl Malone and Bob McAdoo.Slotting Russell Westbrook any higher would demand selective memory.Indeed, he turned a corner once the Houston Rockets steered into microball. He's averaging 31.0 points and 5.8 assists with a 57.5 true shooting percentage since Clint Capela left the rotation. Close to 56 percent of his field-goal attempts are coming inside five feet during this time, compared to 46.3 percent beforehand, where he's shooting 63.4 percent, up from 58.8 percent.It would not be a stretch to say this is the best version of Westbrook ever. The Oklahoma City Thunder never afforded him so much room to maneuver, not even during the Kevin Durant years.His downhill attacks are a different kind of terrifying—and almost impossible to stop—when he's not forced to navigate cramped spaces. He's even upped his accuracy from downtown, to 35.5 percent, while curbing his volume.Still, the first part of the season happened. Westbrook was on course for the fourth-worst true shooting percentage of his career prior to Jan. 1 while firing up far too many threes, during which time the Rockets failed to keep their head above water whenever he played without James Harden. Opponents outscored them by 4.3 points per 100 possessions, with a sub-105 offensive rating, through his solo stints.Westbrook deserves credit for flipping the script, even before Capela's injury and eventual departure. Since Jan. 1, Houston is pumping in 113.9 points per 100 possessions and posting a plus-3.7 net rating when he runs the show without Harden. But those returns have done yet another 180 since Jan. 29, when Capela last played for the Rockets.This level of inconsistency is unsettling. The Rockets are significantly worse off, both now and later, if they cannot count on Westbrook to successfully spearhead units without Harden. His most recent performance is proof he still has the impact of a top-25 player, but his top-15 case is no longer airtight. His average rank across six catch-all-metrics, in fact, suggests he should be lower—closer to No. 40 overall than No. 20.Bradley Beal exists in a gray area of superstardom.Merely having him doesn't assure playoff contention, which puts him outside the top-15-player conversation. And yet, he's also an offense unto himself, fully capable of crashing the All-NBA discourse in any given season. Pegging him as anything less than a top-25 player isn't an option.And to be clear, no one should want it to be.The Washington Wizards' hard-knocks season isn't on Beal. He's eclipsing 30 points and six assists per game with an above-average true shooting percentage, all while subsisting on a diet of difficult shots. James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook are the only players tossing up more contested looks, defined as any attempt during which a defender is between two and four feet away.Granted, even without John Wall in the fold, Beal doesn't shoulder the same from-scratch burden many of his contemporaries do. Nearly half of his made buckets are coming off assists. But what he avoids in next-level difficulty, he makes up for with sheer volume. He owns the league's fifth-highest usage rate, trailing only Trae Young, Luka Doncic, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo.Attributing his numbers exclusively to that volume undermines their significance. This isn't a good-to-greatish player stat-padding on a bad-to-terribleish team. The Wizards offense is optimized through his usage. They go from scoring 114 points per 100 possessions with him on the court (81st percentile) to 106.2 with him off (18th percentile)—a wrong-direction swing that typifies his importance to a team with zero first-option alternatives.Cue the annual \"Kyle Lowry is too damn high!\" pitchfork-carriers.Every time someone tries their hand at sorting the NBA's best, his name invariably appears in front of a few others who seem to deserve more due. How is he ahead of Russell Westbrook? Or Kemba Walker? It makes no sense.In actuality, it makes perfect sense. Lowry's value might even be underrated. He doesn't carry the largest load relative to other point guards or stars at large, but that's part of his charm. He routinely shape-shifts based on the Toronto Raptors' depth chart and lineups.Last year, this meant deferring shots and possessions to Kawhi Leonard and the rise of Pascal Siakam. In seasons past, it meant giving DeMar DeRozan the leeway to expand his playmaking portfolio. And this year—well, this year is some of Lowry's best work yet. He has juggled taking on more of the scoring burden without inhibiting Siakam's continued ascent.Few point guards afford teams so much wiggle room. Having the ability to splash in off-the-bounce threes, break down defenses, drill standstill jumpers and cover larger backcourt assignments while playing beside another smaller guard is different from actually doing it.Lowry doesn't dabble so much as he balances. He is an offensive chameleon. Look no further than his shot distribution. Almost 27 percent of his field-goal attempts come as spot-up threes. Nearly 31 percent, meanwhile, come as pull-up treys. He can both dictate and accommodate the terms of how Toronto plays.His case is only bolstered by the energy he expends on defense. He frustrates opponents in search of offensive fouls and has the stubborn strength to tussle with assignments much larger than himself (6'0\").There is likewise a Damian Lillard-esque air about the way he sets the tone, the author of both culture and identity. The Raptors defend and carry themselves like Kyle Lowry clones. He might not be Toronto's best player—though he was during the DeRozan years—but he is certainly its most important.The numbers support as much. He doesn't lead the Raptors in scoring. Or have their highest net rating swing. But his average rank across six catch-all metrics pegs him as the league's 21st most valuable player (and sixth-best point guard), putting him just ahead of Siakam (No. 26).The benefit of the doubt has assured Kyrie Irving a relatively high finish. And yes, he deserves it.Right shoulder and right knee issues have limited him to just 20 games. His season was deemed over before the NBA suspended play after undergoing surgery to address the former injury. This awfully small sample size cannot be discounted when assessing his value.Plenty of people will argue that Irving should be lower, if not left out altogether. Neither would be a totally unfair claim were we discussing the bigger picture. Murky availability has been a career-long problem, and it is fair to wonder how much worse off his teams actually are without him.Though the Brooklyn Nets have played shorthanded all season, they're still 22-22 when he sits, compared to 8-12 when he's in the lineup. And it doesn't help that the Boston Celtics have not just tread water but improved following his departure over the summer.Now still isn't the time to relitigate Irving's cornerstone value. Brooklyn is the first team for which he has chosen to play, and sweeping conclusions cannot be drawn until he's integrated into a healthier roster. Between injuries to him, Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert, in addition to the exit of head coach Kenny Atkinson, the Nets have not exactly been a portrait of stability.To what extent this falls on Irving isn't readily known. Atkinson's departure coupled with the usual dose of quixotic comments are, at bottom, instruments for debate. But drama and skepticism and health can only nuke Irving's stock if he fails to outstrip the collective concern on the court. That's almost never been his problem.This season is no exception. Through his 20 appearances, Irving averaged 27.4 points and 6.4 assists on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. He still isn't the guy you trust to reach the rim or get to the foul line in volume, but his off-the-dribble shot-making continues to bend the brain. He has buried 38.6 percent of his pull-up threes and rates in the 91st percentile of scoring efficiency as the pick-and-roll ball-handler.Small samples are conducive to noise, but for what it's worth, Irving has also proved to be a more consistent finisher around the basket in Brooklyn. His 65 percent clip at the hoop is a career high.Less debatable is the overall impact he has on the Nets offense. They score 6.4 points per 100 possessions more when he's on the floor, a swing that places in the 92nd percentile and is right in line with his on-off splits through five of the past six seasons. Brooklyn nearly gives everything back on defense when Irving plays, but his offensive credentials squarely put him among the NBA's most valuable players, even amid abbreviated availability.Before the hiatus, Rudy Gobert led the NBA in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus for the fourth consecutive season.He dominated the field in FiveThirtyEight's new catch-all, defensive RAPTOR rating, which incorporates box score numbers, on-off data and tracking data.His value there is so immense that he ranks fifth in the NBA in RAPTOR wins above replacement, behind only James Harden, LeBron James, Antetokounmpo and Kawhi Leonard, despite posting a negative offensive RAPTOR rating.He doesn't seem to have the narrative on his side for a third straight DPOY, but he clearly has an argument.Tune into any Utah Jazz game, and you'll almost certainly see multiple possessions on which a perimeter player dusts his matchup on the outside, gets to the paint and then does an abrupt U-turn upon seeing Gobert. It's a phenomenon that traditional box scores struggle to capture.The way to neutralize that, of course, is by deploying a modern 5 who pulls Gobert from the rim. He does a decent job while playing one-on-one out there, but simply having him out of the paint can break down a Jazz defense that featured only Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles as clear plus defenders outside.That's probably the biggest knock against Gobert. As the Houston Rockets have shown, there are ways to game-plan around his dominance. His career postseason net-rating swing is minus-10.1.Generally speaking, though, he remains one of the most impactful players in the league. His plus-11.0 net-rating swing this regular season ranked in the 95th percentile. He's a devastating, dedicated rim runner, even when high-usage players like Donovan Mitchell don't throw the eventual lob. Just having Gobert attack the rim out of the pick-and-roll bends defenses toward the paint.He's also a staple on the screen-assists leaderboard, generating a league-leading 16.1 points per game off those plays.Put it all together, and it isn't difficult to see why Gobert is still one of the game's best centers, despite not having the guard skills most others have had to develop for survival.It isn't impossible to find a precedent for Pascal Siakam's career trajectory, you might just have to venture outside basketball.Going from 4.2 points as a rookie, to 7.3 points as a sophomore, to 16.9 points and a Most Improved Player in Year 3 is wild enough. Then, Siakam made being the first back-to-back winner of that award feel like a real possibility early in the season.Being elevated to the No. 1 option following Kawhi Leonard's departure torpedoed Siakam's true shooting percentage, but he's still 15th in the league in points per game (23.6) and is posting a slightly-above-average three-point percentage (35.9) on 6.0 attempts.This kind of production is a far cry from the projections of Siakam back when he was a borderline first-round prospect in 2016.\"To even think that I'm in the conversation, I have an opportunity to be [in the NBA], that's crazy to me,\" Siakam told Bleacher Report's C.J. Moore three months before he was drafted. \"For me, it's just about working hard every day and getting better. The thought of knowing that I might one day be there is amazing for me.\"Four years later, Siakam is an All-Star and the leading scorer for a 46-18 team defending a championship.And if that trajectory is any guide, he may not be done improving. The next step is merging the efficiency with which he played in a lesser role in 2018-19 with the volume he has had in 2019-20. If he does that, Toronto could remain a title contender for the foreseeable future.As for defense, there aren't many question marks there. The 6'9\" forward can ably defend multiple positions and rarely gets lost in the Raptors' scheme. For the third straight year, Toronto is surrendering fewer points per 100 possessions when Siakam is on the floor.Is there a more plug-and-play superstar than Paul George?Perhaps out of depth as the every-possession No. 1, he has dominated while working off another primary ball-handler in each of the past three seasons. That's not a given for everyone of his stature.Better players would struggle when having less granular control over the offense. Paul's game is made for that balancing act. It is seamless.Displacing him from the ball gives you one of the league's most dangerous standstill shooters. He has ranked no lower than the 74th percentile of spot-up efficiency through the last five seasons.Tasking him with from-scratch creation leaves you with a viable source of offense. George's 53.2 effective field-goal percentage when shooting out of the pick-and-roll is the 10th-highest among 56 players finishing at least five such possessions per game, and his 38.2 percent success rate on pull-up triples ranks fifth out of everyone firing three or more per game.George distinguishes himself from players who wear similar hats by virtue of his role allocation. He can spend more time as the de facto No. 1 than most other sidekicks. He is at home swishing jumpers after coming around ball screens, even if his turnover woes out of the pick-and-roll are closer to the rule than the exception.\"Playoff P\" is both a laughably lame name for his alter ego and an actual thing (last year's five-game letdown against Portland notwithstanding).Don't bother arguing that George belongs any lower after missing a bunch of time with right shoulder and left hamstring issues. This is his conservative finish. In any normal season, his context-proof offense and All-NBA defense—playing next to Kawhi Leonard hasn't spared him from pestering the best 1s and 2s—earns top-10-player consideration.Ben Simmons' finite offensive range is problematic in that nearly 90 percent of his attempts come inside eight feet. He doesn't even have break-in-case-of-emergency touch beyond there. And yet, his limitations are far from crippling.Simmons has the speed and size (6'10\") to thrive amid his own shortcomings. He's still in the 93rd percentile of finishing around the rim, and defenses remain inclined to collapse around him when he's going downhill.It is within this chaos that Simmons' passing IQ shines. He is a drive-and-kick whiz and has the floor awareness to hit trailing shooters and sling dimes to the corners. No one has assisted on more three-pointers than him, according to PBP Stats.None of this is license to entirely ignore the elephant in the room. Simmons' jumper-less repertoire is an issue, and there seems to exist a clear disconnect between him and head coach Brett Brown, who so obviously wants his 23-year-old superstar to branch out.The operative word here is \"superstar.\" Simmons is flirting with the pinnacle of his profession while skirting one of its most sought-after skills. That speaks to everything else he does, particularly on defense. He can lock down lifelines for entire games.Nobody in the league qualifies as a more versatile defender. Simmons has spent at least 17 percent of his time guarding every position on the floor, save for center, according to Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu. And among every player who has logged at least 1,000 minutes, only Terrance Ferguson and Royce O'Neale have racked up more reps against No. 1 options.Reconciling Simmons' offensive sins is admittedly tougher this side of his five-year max extension. Superstar pay grades come with increased scrutiny and less patience. That the Philadelphia 76ers offense is slightly more efficient with him off the floor this season cannot be written off. But it can be contextualized.Philly took an already unevenly built roster last summer and leaned into the awkwardness. Simmons' drawbacks aren't new. The Sixers knew who he was when they maxed him out and surrounded him with too little shooting and neither enough ball-handling nor spacing to explore what he can do away from the action. That he's come so far despite his team working against him in so many ways is a testament to his value.The list of players who had a better offensive box plus/minus than Karl-Anthony Towns' 4.8 through five seasons is short (and impressive): Michael Jordan (7.9), LeBron James (6.2), Vince Carter (5.4), Chris Paul (5.3), Nikola Jokic (5.2), David Robinson (5.2), Charles Barkley (5.1) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5.0).He isn't quite the passer LeBron, CP3 or Jokic were right off the bat, though his career-high 4.4 assists per game this season shows progress, but Towns' hyper-efficient scoring arsenal makes him perhaps the game's premier big-man weapon.Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who matches or exceeds Towns' career marks for points per 75 possessions (24.4) and true shooting percentage (62.2). To get that level of scoring prowess out of a 5 is likely unimaginable for other organizations.And despite missing much of the season with injuries, Towns has shown he's still developing.He's posting career highs in points (26.5), assists (4.4), made threes (3.3) and effective field-goal percentage (60.0). No one has ever had a season that matches Towns' 2019-20 combination of efficiency, volume and rebounding.Progress on the defensive end seems to have stalled for Towns, though. Minnesota allows a whopping 6.2 more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. Opponents' effective field-goal percentage is 3.4 points higher when he plays.His defensive rebounding and shot blocking (1.2 per game) provide value on that end, but he still loses focus far too often and is regularly caught out of position.But there's no question his offensive contributions outweigh the defensive shortcomings. For the fifth time in five seasons, the Timberwolves' net rating is better with Towns on the floor.Every so often a superstar's decline is not just exaggerated but invented. It is talked about as a matter of fact when, in reality, it has yet to begin.Such was the plight of Chris Paul entering this season. The Houston Rockets treated him as the less valuable player in their trade for Russell Westbrook, and the Oklahoma City Thunder tried to reroute him upon arrival. Some of this recurring reservation was precautionary. Paul is an undersized point guard (6'0\") on the verge of turning 35 and owed $85.6 million over the next two years. Time is a friend to neither his ability nor price point.Viewed against those concerns, Paul's situation was still overblown. Even when presented with the disclaimer that the Thunder might keep the core intact past the trade deadline, they did not begin the year as a consensus playoff contender. That aloofness is atypical of a team built around a fringe top-10 player.Just so we're clear: Paul absolutely remains a fringe top-10 player. His 17.7 points and 6.8 assists per game don't leap off the page, but they come on tough-to-fathom efficiency. He is posting the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career and has been Kevin Durant automatic from mid-range, where he's connecting on 53 percent of his looks, another personal best.Paul continues to take great pleasure in cooking bigs off the dribble when they switch on to him, and he is still a defensive bulldog. Even more impressive is the extent to which the Thunder thrive by leaning on him. Their offensive rating improves by 13.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, the second-largest such swing among anyone who has logged at least 250 minutes. (Of note: Danilo Gallinari, his teammate, is first.)This dependence carries over to crunch time, where Paul leads Oklahoma City in usage rate by a country mile. He's slashing 53.5/36.0/93.8 in the clutch, which is just silly. Among every player with similar usage who has made at least five crunch-time appearances, only Joel Embiid owns a higher true shooting percentage, which is even sillier—and the core reason why the Thunder are 29-13 in clutch contests.When he's engaged, Joel Embiid shows flashes of Rudy Gobert-level defense and Karl-Anthony Towns-level offense. Though probably a little shy of both comparisons, when combined, Embiid looks like he might be the best center in the game.He's shown an ability to step out and hit threes or dominate a post-up like Towns. And his rim protection and recovery speed is elite in certain defensive possessions. But he struggles to consistently provide that level of play on both ends.Even with ebbs and flows of effort, though, his 23.4 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.3 blocks in 30.2 minutes per game impress.And for the fourth straight season, the Philadelphia 76ers' net rating is better with Embiid on the floor. His defensive-rating swing ranks in the 94th percentile, which is somehow a career low.One thing he never struggles with is an ability to get to the line. Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Embiid's 10.1 free-throw attempts per 75 possessions trails only Shaq's 10.4.That's why his true shooting percentage is always above average, despite a 51.4 effective field-goal percentage that falls shy of the 52.2 average during his career.When Embiid gets the ball, his mind often seems already made up to attack. And officials often can't help but blow the whistle.Getting all those scoring possessions at the line has a compound effect. Embiid's free-throw percentage yields around 1.6 points per two-shot trip to the line. And each whistle gets the opposition closer to the penalty and foul trouble.Embiid can be a great defender, floor spacer and post player, but his most consistent, valuable contribution might be that foul-drawing ability.Among players with at least 50 post-ups, Embiid leads the NBA with 1.12 points per post-up possession. But that's buoyed by the fact that he draws shooting fouls on nearly a quarter of those possessions. His effective field-goal percentage out of the post ranks 16th, right behind teammate Ben Simmons.  The process to get here wasn't always smooth, even after a standout rookie season in 2017-18, but Jayson Tatum is now the guiding force through which the Boston Celtics play. It is on the back of this progression that he's entered superstar territory.Skeptics like to harp on his efficiency. His 56.2 true shooting percentage is below the league average, and he's banging in his mid-range jumpers at an unspectacular clip. Calling him erratic or unreliable still equates to misinformation.Relative to his shot quality, Tatum has actually outperformed expectations, according to PBP Stats.Among everyone attempting at least three pull-up triples per game, only Damian Lillard and Caris LeVert are downing theirs at a better clip. Nikola Jokic is the lone soul who has converted more looks inside four seconds of the shot clock, and Tatum's 55.7 effective field-goal percentage in these situations ranks first out of 104 players who have 50 or more relevant attempts under their belt.Having another scorer, aside from their point guard, so comfortable creating something out of nothing is a boon for the Celtics offense. They've more than doubled his pick-and-roll volume accordingly. And in recent months, he's parlayed that additional responsibility into more volume around the hoop.Tatum's playmaking does still trail expectations for someone in his role. He has the lowest assist rate of anyone with his usage. But the feel for throwing less obvious passes is there, and he's proved capable of carrying league-average offensive units without Kemba Walker. His assist totals should approve with repetition.Through it all, Tatum has maintained the seamlessness of his offense. He hits a ton of self-created threes, but almost half of his overall shots come off assists. He dominates with his escape dribble and step-back three; he preserves his fit next to everyone else with his spot-up touch and opportunism in transition.This says nothing of his defense, which is borderline All-NBA-caliber. Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart streamline his workload by chasing around the glitziest assignments, but his help around the basket and free-safety gambles are one of the Celtics' most precious defensive devices.It is no accident Tatum owns their largest net-rating swing (plus-10.9). His two-way impact is their foremost building block.The Milwaukee Bucks need a second star.Scant few takes have become more outdated than this one. Reductive disclaimers haven't aged much better.Khris Middleton isn't a traditional No. 2 option.What in the what does that actually mean?Maybe the influx of superteams and superstar free-agency pairings over the past decade has restricted the criteria for sidekicks on championship contenders. That's fair enough and perhaps a legitimate problem for the Bucks given the teams they most likely must get past in prospective Finals matchups.Except, well, it shouldn't be considered an issue right now. If Middleton didn't qualify as a genuine star before—and that's a big if—he does this season.Middleton is tied with Damian Lillard for the highest true shooting percentage among everyone averaging more than 25 points per 36 minutes, a list populated almost exclusively by, you guessed it, consensus superstars. But it isn't just these numbers. It's the method by which they come.Misrepresenting Middleton's place in the league usually begins with the assumption that he's the benefactor of Giannis Antetokounmpo's world domination and the Bucks' floor balance. Who wouldn't thrive playing next to the NBA's reigning MVP, inside four- and five-out lineups? Milwaukee's environment no doubt glitters up Middleton's role, but it hasn't made him in full.Self-creation is ingrained into his game. He runs pick-and-rolls into pull-up jumpers. He shoots over mismatches in isolation and from the post. Tough fadeaways are business as usual. His off-the-dribble three is deployed in small doses but remains effective. He is the secondary playmaker everyone's waiting for Jayson Tatum to be (which, for now, gives him a clear, albeit slight, edge over Boston's fast-rising linchpin).In fairness to his critics, Middleton lacks a certain preponderance. His game still stalls out inside the arc, where he's neither strong nor explosive enough to live at the basket. A career-low 15 percent of his looks are coming at the rim this season (7th percentile).Beyond that, Middleton has all the trimmings of an offensive nerve center. The Bucks aren't the Bucks without their capacity to navigate minutes sans Antetokounmpo. Middleton is central to that independence. Milwaukee outscores opponents by 8.1 points per 100 possessions during his solo stints with an offensive rating that ranks in the 94th percentile.Ebbing offensive efficiency is a threat to Jimmy Butler's place in this exercise. His 24.8 percent clip from three is the second-lowest of his career, and among 111 players attempting at least three pull-up jumpers per game, his 33.8 effective field-goal percentage ranks...110th.To his credit, Butler has supplemented struggles from the perimeter with relentless assaults on the basket. A staggering 43 percent of his looks are coming at the rim, his highest share since 2012-13. Defenses are still inclined to overreact when he gets going downhill, and he is an expert at both creating and finishing through contact. He ranks in the 100th percentile of shooting foul percentage.Butler has further counteracted his spiraling outside clips with additional playmaking. His 6.1 dimes per game are a career high, and he places inside the top 25 of potential assists. The Miami Heat are at their scariest when he's captaining fast breaks.Even in a down shooting season—his crunch-time splits aren't pretty—Butler has proved to be more than essential. The Heat need every ounce of the pressure he puts on defenses off the dribble. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn are the closest they come to face-up alternatives, which won't cut it. Miami's offensive rating takes a nosedive whenever Butler is on the bench.And more so than anyone else, Butler deserves credit for keeping the Heat afloat on defense.They started fizzling by December but have stayed above board when he's in the game—no small ask given how much time he spent in lineups with three negative defenders prior to the trade deadline. Playing beside Bam Adebayo, Mr. Happy Feet himself, barely qualifies as a luxury under those circumstances.This season was always going to be a test of Butler's stardom—of whether he, at age 30 and independent of another top-25 player (Adebayo isn't there...yet), guaranteed his team a playoff spot. It turns out he does.Year 1 as a Los Angeles Laker couldn't have gone much better for Anthony Davis so far.His per-game numbers of 26.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.4 blocks and 1.5 steals, in concert with L.A.'s Western Conference-leading 49-14 record, has AD all the way up to fourth in Basketball Reference's 2019-20 MVP Tracker.The chemistry between him and LeBron James—who trails only Giannis Antetokounmpo in that tracker—seems instantaneous.The Lakers are plus-10.4 points per 100 possessions (95th percentile) when AD and LeBron share the floor. LeBron passing to AD is the most prolific assist combo in the league. And the three-time champion has had no issue deferring to Davis when both are in the game.In those situations, the big man's usage percentage is 26.7. And he trails only Joel Embiid and LaMarcus Aldridge in post-ups per game.The knock against Davis, of course, is that the Lakers are minus-0.9 points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor without LeBron. And the defense is dreadful for those possessions.That may be a bit nitpicky, though, as his time in New Orleans probably taught us he's not the kind of player who can singlehandedly carry a team to above-average play.Instead, he may be the absolute best No. 2 (he still trails LeBron in usage) in the NBA.Damian Lillard's superstar stock is aided by the anecdotal perhaps more so than any of his peers.This isn't to imply he doesn't have the statistical credentials. He absolutely does. His 28.9 points and 7.8 assists per game are career highs, and they come on a personal-best true shooting percentage (61.9). Larry Bird, James Harden and Michael Jordan are the only other players to hit those benchmarks for an entire season.Really think about it, and this is sort of absurd. Superstars in their prime reach new peaks, but the means by which Lillard has gotten there is different. He has improved incrementally almost each and every season, adding new wrinkles to his game at a stage of his career when many are settled in their ways and focused on maintenance rather than expansion.Getting swept by the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the 2018 playoffs motivated him to improve his decision-making versus double-teams. This year, without a big who can flip up shots and toss passes out of short rolls, he has diversified his own pick-and-roll package. And his finishing around the rim, while still below league average, is more bankable than it has been in most other years.All this time later, Lillard remains the NBA's closest approximation to the best version of Stephen Curry. No one is better on super-deep threes at the moment. He leads the Association in attempts from 29-plus feet, where he's shooting a bonkers 41.1 percent. And where others offer a reasonable facsimile, Lillard noticeably separates himself with an actual defensive motor and, most importantly, a certain plug-and-playness.Someone like Trae Young doesn't yet have the luxury of a secondary playmaker who invites him to relinquish control, but you could see other megastars, such as Luka Doncic or James Harden, suffering unintended consequences if tasked with deferring too often. Lillard's style, similar to Curry's, is inoculated against that wart.And yeah, in the grand scheme of things, his intangibles matter. He's among the players who make you believe the clutch gene exists, even when his shots aren't falling. More than that, he is the master at cultivating and preserving culture.For most teams, bringing in both Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside would've been a notional heat check. For the Portland Trail Blazers, it was business as usual, thanks in largest part to their top-10 superstar and emotional bellwether.What you're about to read might sound like hyperbole, but I assure you: Nikola Jokic is on track to be one of the best centers in NBA history.Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Jokic ranks sixth all-time in box plus/minus, trailing only Michael Jordan Jordan, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Magic Johnson and David Robinson.Before the league was suspended, he was averaging 20.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.7 blocks in just 32.3 minutes per game.This is his fourth season (he's only played five) with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists per 75 possessions. No one else has more than three such seasons, and Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and Kevin Garnett are the only players in league history to have at least one.Oscar Robertson and Magic, both of whom averaged more minutes and played in eras with a faster pace, are the only players in league history with more triple-doubles than Jokic before turning 26.The Serbian center fills up stat sheets like few players ever have, and they're not just empty numbers. This season, his plus-9.2 net-rating swing ranks in the 93rd percentile (he's never been below the 89th percentile).Before he was selected first-team All-NBA for 2018-19, there was a robust debate over who the game's best center was. With each passing year, Jokic makes it harder to argue against him.Even at seven feet tall, he is functionally Denver's point guard. His vision from anywhere on the floor is unparalleled. He can lead a break or pick apart defenses in the half court. And his passing repertoire is outrageous.He has absurd touch as a scorer, particularly on flip shots and his patented Sombor Shuffle. His footwork in the post hearkens back to the days when big men ruled the league.Defensively, Jokic gets a bad rap because of the lowlights he finds himself in when switched on to much smaller players on the perimeter. No, he's not the most fleet of foot. But generally speaking, he's in the right spots defensively, knows how to take up space without fouling and actually has a very good steal rate, thanks to deceptively quick hands.Denver has allowed fewer points per 100 possessions with Jokic on the floor in each of his five seasons. During his career, his 1.9 defensive box plus/minus is tied for ninth in the NBA.He is, at the very least, an above-average defender. And when you combine that with all-time great offense, you get one of the best players in the world.Can someone knocking down under 32 percent of their threes really be one of the NBA's most valuable shooters? It turns out yes.Luka Doncic's game is not the least bit inefficient. It is just a different brand of efficiency. His 31.8 percent clip from deep comes on absurd volume—9.8 attempts per 36 minutes—and incomprehensible difficulty. Only James Harden and Damian Lillard take a larger share of their triples after using seven or more dribbles, and he's fourth in points scored off unassisted treys, according to PBP Stats.Both the volume and difficulty on Doncic's threes act in service of everyone else. The mere threat of his step-backs and parking-lot range invites defensive attention commanded by, maybe, seven other players. The Dallas Mavericks' league-best offense improves by 4.4 points per 100 possessions when he's on the floor (83rd percentile), not by chance but by the openings his long-distance volume creates and the ridiculous on-the-move passes he flings.Awarding Doncic top-five-player status is not an overreaction to his sophomore climb. He has amplified his game to the distress of opposing defenses. His step-back gather is more nonchalant than that of Harden, and he's gotten better at leveraging it into opportunities inside the arc. He's more effective at keeping defenders on his back hip, and he mixes changes in direction with shifts in pace to keep helpers on tilt. (It'd be nice to him mix in more of this variety during crunch-time situations.)This variance in attack has coincided with souped-up finishing. Doncic is shooting 73 percent at the rim (94th percentile) and 57.4 percent on all-two pointers. His flip shots are deadly when he's going downhill, and he's pieced together a strong situational post game.That he has both honed and expanded his offensive bag while shouldering even more responsibility is patently ridiculous. Dramatic upticks in volume tend to come at the price of efficiency. Doncic's true shooting percentage has actually jumped roughly four points from his rookie season even though his usage rate has spiked by 6.5.Combine all that with almost unparalleled vision—he's already one of the league's seven best passers—and he has an ironclad case as one of the NBA's top-five players. And he hasn't even technically entered his prime.If watchability debates were a metric for value, James Harden would have no fewer than three unanimous MVP trophies sitting on his mantle.Opinions of his game don't actually matter. The aesthetics are open for interpretation. The results are not. Harden has unlocked an alternative means of sustaining efficient offense. He burns through more isolations than entire teams and has standardized the use of step-back threes. The Houston Rockets don't even go through the trouble of sending that many ball screens his way anymore. He doesn't need them. His 1.22 points per isolation possession are the equivalent of a league-best offense on their own.Sitting through this brazen of an approach can be grating for those with no vested interests in Houston's well-being.The possessions aren't always long—the Rockets are second in average possession time, per Inpredictable—but they can be monotonous and, anecdotally, seem to last forever. His search for three-shot fouls and four-point plays is frustrating, if only because both its success and failure lack a consistent baseline. The way he chases—and exaggerates—contact on drives to the basket is equally infuriating for similar reasons and because of what it does to the pace of play.Say what you will about the look of it all, that it's gimmicky or not in the spirit of the game. The Rockets, in their eyes, have spotted a market inefficiency, and they've elected to ride it, repeatedly, to title contention. Playoff flameouts open them up to criticism, but jockeying for a top-three regular-season finish in the Western Conference every year is nothing to belittle.None of it's possible without Harden. He has broken regular-season defenses, not unlike Stephen Curry, only on the back of harder-to-love extremes. Focusing too much on the pretense of Harden's invention risks underselling the significance of what he's doing: scoring like hell, to the tune of 34.4 points per game on unreal efficiency.For anyone who can't appreciate that, perhaps they can at least muster affection for his playmaking. Harden has achieved absolute awareness in the half court and throws some of the league's most mind-meltingly difficult passes.Because, obviously, scoring like hell isn't enough.Kawhi Leonard's best-player-in-the-league case keeps receiving convincing bumps.Winning a second title and Finals MVP last year was the peak of his argument. That he wound up leaving the Toronto Raptors partially added to the intrigue. This wasn't him emerging from the shadows of his Hall of Fame teammates. It was him spearheading an entire championship push in a one-off situation while playing through a left knee injury that became progressively worse as the postseason soldiered on.Not that he needed it, but Leonard's second title legitimized him in a way 2013-14's banner year never needed to, a measuring stick for just how unfathomably far his offensive game had come. The Raptors put him at the center of their universe, and it worked.Leonard's performance this season, on yet another new team, has amplified his cause, resetting his career peak once more. The Los Angeles Clippers opened the year leaning on him for extreme pick-and-roll usage. That volume has come down from its initial high, but it still makes up roughly one-third of Leonard's offensive possessions, by far and away the largest share of his career.Cooking more initiation into his routine has given way to the long-anticipated playmaking surge. Leonard doesn't toss the same fancy-schmancy passes James Harden and LeBron James do, but he's successfully leveraging the chaos he inflicts into gimme opportunities for his teammates.Defenses regress into ataxic clutter when he maneuvers inside the arc, and so many opponents are predisposed to show double-teams as soon as he catches the ball outside the rainbow. The attention he draws, verging on panic, is the turbine Los Angeles uses to power its offense. Leonard is averaging a career-high 5.6 assists per 36 minutes, and the Clippers are scoring 116.8 points per 100 possessions (93rd percentile) when he plays without Paul George and Lou Williams.Driving an entire offense as the primary facilitator is Leonard's final frontier, the last step in his quest, be it deliberate or incidental, to become the NBA's most complete player.His progression as a scorer already gave him a stake in that conversation before now. He swishes pull-up mid-rangers on autopilot, and his bullish drives to the basket render defenders who aren't built like houses mostly helpless. His off-the-bounce three is on the come-down, but teams still respect it, and he remains lights-out off the catch.That someone can be so utterly assertive on offense—30.0 points per 36 minutes on 58.5 percent true shooting—while guarding at an All-NBA level is beyond comprehension. Leonard doesn't exhaust his defensive stores on every possession, thus creating negligible separation between himself and Giannis Antetokounmpo. But the engagement and resolve he's sustained for the latter half of this season are truly, totally terrifying.LeBron James' will should be showing signs of erosion at age 35—something, anything, that suggests he is exiting his prime.So much for thatFor whatever reason—and there are many—he seems further away from his twilight than last season. Whether it's the arrival of Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers' proximity to a title, a disdain for the push to inaugurate Giannis Antetokounmpo or Kawhi Leonard as the league's best player or some combination of everything, LeBron is carrying himself with a renewed sense of purpose and swagger.That fresh approach is most evident on the defensive end. He isn't checking fellow superstars every night, but he's openly more engaged in the half-court. His close-outs on shooters have more pep, in that he's actually closing out on shooters, and he's fighting through screens with intent, enough to help Los Angeles coax ball-handlers into long mid-range jumpers and keep them from working the corners.Much is made of the Lakers offense in LeBron's absence, and correctly so. They are short no fewer than one ball-handler. But the defense has, statistically, suffered more when he's off the court. That's not telltale of anything groundbreaking. It also isn't purely a function of his spending so much time beside Davis and Danny Green.On offense, meanwhile, LeBron still emits inevitability. What he wants to do gets done.Just as he developed a post game in Miami and added a step-back three into his ammunition depot last season, he has decided that now, in Year 17, is the time to win the league's assist crown. It is this added influence over the offense that allows him to hold off the stars most closely at his heels—namely Kawhi Leonard.Players have rarely churned out 25-point, 10-assist detonations so regularly, much less at LeBron's age. He has six years on anyone else who maintained those averages for an entire season. What he's doing now isn't natural. Yet watching him, it looks and feels organic.In truth, that's LeBron's career arc in a nutshell. He has normalized, even numbed us to, what isn't. Someday, he'll cease contending for MVPs and best-player-alive honors. That time isn't now. What's more, it doesn't appear to be on the horizon, either.This might be the easiest call of this project. Giannis isn't just the NBA's best power forward in 2019-20, he is having an all-time great campaign, regardless of position.His 11.5 box plus/minus is the ninth-best single-season mark in NBA history. LeBron James (three times), Michael Jordan (three times), Stephen Curry and David Robinson are the only players with better seasons by that mark.And while the per-game numbers—29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks—that underlie that box plus/minus are eye-popping, they still don't do this season justice.Like Curry and the Golden State Warriors in 2015-16, Giannis hasn't needed to play a ton of minutes for his team to put games away early. For the season, he is averaging just 30.9 minutes per game.His per-75-possession numbers—32.9 points, 15.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks—are literally unprecedented. And no one's all that close.That seemingly impossible individual production for a 53-12 team suggests Giannis should win MVP in a landslide. The aforementioned tracker agrees.For the reigning winner of that honor, the real prize might be Defensive Player of the Year. If he secured both awards, Giannis would join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to pull that off.In addition to his 12.7 defensive rebounds (first this season and third-most all time), 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions, Milwaukee allow 11.3 fewer points per 100 possessions when Giannis is on the floor, giving him a defensive rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.For further context, the Bucks allow just 97.7 points per 100 possessions when Giannis plays. The league average defensive rating this season is 110.4.Not only is Giannis one of the most nightmarish (for opponents) point forwards the league has ever seen, he's a versatile defensive anchor who can guard multiple positions.If his still-developing jump shot ever truly arrives, it might be impossible to even imagine a 4 more perfectly suited for the modern NBA.      Unless otherwise noted, stats courtesy of NBA.com, Basketball Reference or Cleaning the Glass.Andy Bailey and Dan Favale cover the NBA for Bleacher Report.

      "    Best DC Comics to start with for new readers including Superman, Batman and more\n",
      "Whether you're wanting to get into Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, or any superhero either in the Justice League or out of it, you'll need the right starter comics for getting into DC. Backstory, reboots, resets, parallel universes and varying timelines - it can be a lot, but it's worth it if you can find that easy way in with a good read with all the necessary details.That's where we come in to help. In our guide below we'll show you all the easiest comic stories and arcs to find your way into DC comics, whoever your favourite character is, as well as some basic info on DC itself.If you're struggling to get into DC Comics, that's more than fair. It's not easy to get into any big franchise with a big history, and though it's absolutely worth the effort, we can't blame you if you feel a bit intimidated or put off. Fortunately, there's some cheat codes and easy solutions to that. For one thing, check out our piece on the best Marvel Comics, as the guidelines and tips we put there are also great when it comes to DC too! Once you know those, all you need to do is pick one of the comics listed below and you'll be off. Oh, and a quick, wild history lesson first.So here's the thing: DC has often tried to simplify or fix elements of their history for the sake of readers with big, cosmic events or time-control events. So whereas Marvel - for better or worse - is generally one long timeline that remains largely consistent, DC will occasionally reboot or reset their multiverse with some changes, often designed to make it easier for new readers. Problem is, the result is that now there's a big, looping history that twists and reverses and changes and can seem more bewildering than ever. Fortunately, we've laid out some of the biggest markers below, when they were published, and what you need to know about them.DC's universe wasn't initially planned, it arose naturally as more and more comics were written under the same company, and little crossovers and team-ups became the norm. And all this began with Superman in the first ever issue of Action Comics in 1938, kickstarting \"the golden age of comics\" and leading to decades of DC and multi-generational heroics.In the 1950s and 60s DC were remaking a lot of their old heroes in a more modern, sci-fi style, but this was leading to a lot of bemused questions from fans. Why were there two guys called Superman? Why was one Green Lantern a man in an opera cape, and another was a space cop? The multiverse had been referenced and alluded to before, but here was where it began properly, as an explanation to these kinds of questions. There was more than one universe, with duplicates of different heroes! A whole multiverse of heroes and villains was built off the back of this, with the main two realities being referred to as \"Earth One\" and \"Earth Two.\"This is the big one; the crossover event so huge that it split DC in half, with fans referring to everything before and after as being \"Pre-Crisis\" or \"Post-Crisis\". Structured as both a celebration of DC's history, as well as a complete rebuilding and streamlining of their lore, it redefined everything. Even the tagline went \"worlds will live, worlds will die, and nothing will ever be the same.\"It certainly lived up to that message: all the multiverse was shattered, rebuilt and merged together, erasing everything down to one reality that was pretty much beginning anew. Most of the comics that came afterwards were reboots of classic heroes' origins, setting a firm history to work from, and even though the wider multiverse would return two decades later in the sequel event, Infinite Crisis, now we had a firm core universe that everything was centred on, and a firm history to go with it. At least until…Yes, we're back to the Flash again. Wanting to recreate the success of Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC rebooted their whole reality when Barry Allen runs back in time and changes a bunch of things by accident. He puts it back as best he can, but the result was the New 52: a whole new wave of comics that, again, reset and retold all the big hero's stories and began them anew. This was the new status quo forever!Well, for about five years, at least. Convergence is a grand, complicated ol' story of reality being mangled and unmangled, but the result was the full restoration of the DC multiverse and the recreation of the pre-Flashpoint timeline. Nothing from the New 52 was erased, but now there was just a New 52 universe, and the previous Post-Crisis universe next to that. I guess it's the best of both worlds when there's literally two worlds in play.In the wake of Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC began to rebuild and renew all their heroes, starting from the basics, and John Byrne's renowned telling of Clark Kent's origins is a perfect beginning for that. It sets all the big elements of the Superman mythos into play with a fun, light-hearted tone, and helped establish the Last Son of Krypton's origins in a way that'd define the legendary hero for decades.There's no shortage of Batman comics to leap onto, but few of them are as expansive as Batman: Hush, which introduces many characters, but also tells an entirely fresh story that works on its own. Aside from Jim Lee's artwork being achingly good, it's a mystery story about an unknown figure sabotaging Batman's efforts by collaborating with numerous other villains. Each individual issue focuses on Bruce and one of his supporting cast, giving a great sense of the scope of Batman's world and introducing you to all the people in it. It's also got one of the very few examples of a Superman/Batman fight that doesn't come across as completely ridiculous and contrived, and that is an achievement, if nothing else.George Pérez's run is considered one of the great eras of Wonder Woman. Like The Man of Steel, it's a follow-on from Crisis on Infinite Earths, but Pérez's work carried on beyond a simple retelling of Diana's origins into a vast epic of mythology that spanned the DC universe and back again. Wonder Woman's origins have always changed across the era - from god to demigod to ambitious pottery project - but the core of the character is set in stone and the reason why Diana has been an icon for all this time.Aquaman is many things - hero, warrior, outcast, king - but here in the wake of the Convergence event and the Rebirth relaunch, we see him as something new: an ambassador. Working to build relationships between Atlantis and humanity, all of Arthur and Mera's work is put under threat when a mysterious force begins trying to sabotage matters with a series of planned attacks. It's a fun, quietly clever book that does respect to all the characters and effortlessly introduces Atlantis to humanity - us included.Flash stuff is a little complicated: there's three characters all with a claim to being THE Flash. There's Jay Garrett and his tin helmet in the forties, Barry Allen as the most famous Flash in the 50s onwards, and his nephew Wally West taking over when Barry died in Crisis on Infinite Earths (don't worry, he got better later on). If you're talking iconic though, Barry is considered by most to be the definitive Flash, and there's no better way to get why than starting with his beginnings in 1956, as well many of his famous villains in the follow-up issues.The Green Lantern mythos is a massive, crazy idea: a whole organization of cosmic law enforcement using weaponised courage channelled through jewellery, all as part of a whole spectrum of harnessed, colour-themed emotions. With all that in mind, best start from the beginning. Emerald Dawn is the retelling of Hal Jordan, the first Green Lantern's origins (there's been about five or six Earth-born Lanterns total since then), in his journey from cocky test pilot to… er, cocky superhero.Many of you probably know Oliver Queen simply as \"Arrow\" after the TV show, but the bones are pretty similar: a rich industrialist who, after being stranded in a shipwreck, teaches himself mastery of the bow and returns to civilisation as the vigilante hero styled after Robin Hood, known as the Green Arrow. The Archer's Quest is a perfect way to find out about Ollie's history, a walk through his past as he goes looking for old memorabilia and treasures tied to his identity.From villain to antihero to icon, Harley Quinn first appeared in the 90s animated Batman show, but was popular enough to be brought into the comics' continuity. In fact, we see how that's done right here, in a story that outlines her history, her character, and her lasting connection with Poison Ivy, the impact of which we're still seeing in comics now. Harley's history itself is split into two halves: being with the Joker and moving beyond him midway through the New 52, turning into an independent character with her own agenda. Whichever phase you find her in, Harley's always dangerously enjoyable to read.There's been a hundred different versions of the Justice League, with different names, line-ups and causes, but perhaps the most enjoyable is Giffen's acclaimed run on the team from the late eighties. With many of the most popular heroes unavailable, Batman forms a new version of the League, largely using B-lister heroes like Guy Gardner, Mister Miracle and Doctor Fate. The tone was light and comedic, with many readers fondly remembering the bumbling bromance between Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, which carries on in DC to this very day. It's probably not the perfect representation of the Justice League, not with how goofy it gets (or how certain characters feel like caricatures of themselves), but it's fun and fresh, and determined to make you enjoy yourself no matter what.There you have it - a whole multiverse of comics to be starting with, with hundreds more beloved characters beyond that, from the New Gods to Swamp Thing to the Teen Titans to Zatanna to Animal Man and more!

      "The 30 Best Marvel Graphic Novels of All TimeSpider-Man. The X-Men. Captain America. Iron Man. The Hulk. Captain Marvel. Those iconic heroes and so much more belong to the House of Marvel. Arguably the world’s top comic book imprint and entertainment powerhouse, Marvel has gifted the world with amazing storylines, beloved characters, and a long line of top-notch blockbusters that have captured the attention of millions. Thanks to the business/creative moves made by innovators such as Martin Goodman, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and several others, Marvel has morphed into a huge facet of American culture and can be throughout every corner of media. On the comic book side of the spectrum, Marvel has produced a wide swath of riveting tales that have been compiled into must-read graphic novels.We’re here to provide you with the very best stories Marvel has to offer in graphic novel form. The 30 stories we’ve put here before you here perfectly capture the pomp and circumstance comic book fans have become accustomed to when it comes to Marvel.EXCELSIOR!Secret Wars is one of the most monumental events in not just Marvel Comics history, but comics as a whole. The presence of The Beyonder leads to an epic struggle between the entirety of the Marvel universe and results in a pretty wild plot that sees Doctor Doom end up at the center of that struggle. Secret Wars may not have gotten the most positive reception upon release but over time, it’s garnered a bit of love due to its long-lasting effect on some of Marvel’s greatest characters. Plus the action-packed panels make it an exciting read.The all-powerful Thanos gets quoted by anyone and everyone these days thanks to his incredible villain role in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. The story arc that clearly inspired those films and brought the “Mad Titan” to the forefront is this one. Infinity Gauntlet is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to get wrapped up in the Marvel Universe - it follows the Avengers, the New Warriors, the X-Men, Silver Surfer, Adam Warlock, and more as they clash with Thanos & his universe-altering gems.Matt Fraction and David Aja’s combined efforts led to a career resurgence for Marvel’s expert bow and arrow wielder, Hawkeye. This Eisner Award-nominated run follows the hero as he comes to grips with a tumultuous life that shows more of his human side over his heroic exploits. When he eventually does get into some superhero hijinks, this series gets even more engrossing as Hawkeye clashes with mobsters and so much more alongside his understudy Kate Hudson & his loyal pup.The man behind the mask is Tony Stark. And his biggest issue comes in the form of rampant alcoholism. Iron Man: Demon in a Bottle follows Mr. Stark as he’s forced to confront his innermost problem while simultaneously contending with Justin Hammer & his formidable army of baddies. The clever writing included in Demon in a Bottle does an amazing job of handling the difficulty of alcoholism and presents Tony in a more relatable light for readers who’ve been forced to deal with it themselves.New Avengers Vol. 1: Breakout takes place after the dissolution of the original Avengers team lineup. With such an important event taking place within the Marvel universe, a concealed evil rises under the surface to take advantage of it all. A series of harmful events leads to two of the original Avengers members reuniting and aligning themselves with a strong class of fellow superheroes. This astounding tale follows the initial formation of the New Avengers during their rebooted run as a superhero collective.If you got sucked into the Jessica Jones show that used to be on Netflix, then it’s definitely worth checking out the series she originated from. Alias: Ultimate Collection, Book 1 showcases a side of Marvel Comics that delivers more mature storytelling, darker humor, and intriguing detective work from the former costumed hero turned private eye. Jessica Jones gets caught up in conspiracy theories, disappearances, and even a date with a beloved superhero. And you’ll end up loving every bit of each and every plot thread.Marvel’s mutant contingent has been rebooted plenty of times already. One of the best fresh takes on the fan-favorite team comes from creators Joss Whedon and John Cassaday. Astonishing X-Men. Vol. 1: Gifted brings Cyclops and Emma Frost into the picture as they build a new X-Men troupe. A major event that centers around a supposed “mutant cure” goes public and a new foe named Ord comes into the picture, however. With those two obstacles put in place, this new X-Men team has their work cut out for them from the start in the most difficult ways possible.If you’re reading this right now, then you’re probably one of the many MCU fans who hold the Captain America: The Winter Soldier film in very high regard. The original storyline lifted right from this graphic novel’s pages came to life wonderfully on the big screen, which is why you should pay tribute to those same pages with a thorough read. One of the best Captain America stories of all time features the return of Bucky Barnes, the demise of the Red Skull, and a dangerous group of Red Skull followers who are out to wreak havoc in his wake.When the X-Men of the 1980s are made aware of their race’s ultimate demise in the future, they’re forced to spring into action to prevent that future from coming to fruition. X-Men: Days of Future Past centers around Kitty Pride as she converges with her future self to help the X-Men prevent a specific event from transpiring in order to save mutantkind from a doomed future. Alongside that monumental story, this graphic novel includes the debut of Alpha Flight and marks the return of the Wendigo. X-Men: Days of Future Past is the quintessential X-Men story from the Silver Age of Comic Books.Chris Claremont is regarded as one of the greatest comic book writers of all time. And his biggest claim to fame is his run on the X-Men from 1975 right up until 1991. When he went into graphic novel mode alongside comic book artists Brent Anderson, greatness ensued with the creation of X-Men: God Loves, Man Kills. This storyline forces Professor X’s mutants to align themselves with their mortal enemy Magnet in order to confront an overwhelming threat. The religious zealot at the heart of this grand tale raises the stakes for the X-Men and all of mutantkind.Frank Miller’s legendary status is due in part to his run on the Daredevil comics during the 1980s. The biggest and best story arc from that run has always been considered to be “Born Again,” which follows the ground-level hero as he encounters one of his biggest struggles. With his identity known by the Kingpin menace and his life in more danger than ever before, Daredevil must overcome his mental anguish and fight for survival.When Marvel’s most influential heroes work alongside each other, you can’t help but root for them in their fight for justice. It becomes a tough endeavor once those heroes enter into a major conflict that threatens to disrupt their unity, however. The “Civil War” storyline produces such a dispute between those saviors. Once the U.S. government enacts the Superhero Registration Act, lines are drawn between those who support it and those who don’t. What ensues is the most action-packed...well, disagreement in the Marvel Universe.2020 marked the relaunch of the X-Men as a pillar of the Marvel Universe before the start of the “Dawn of X” story arc. When Professor X makes the world aware of the mutant nation of Krakoa, a temporary partnership between mutant and humankind is put into action. But at some point, that perfect union comes apart at the seams and leads to a brand new mission statement for all of Homo superior. The X-Men mythos is impacted in the most shocking manner possible across their past, present, and future.Deadpool’s hilarious fourth-wall-breaking antics never disappoint. Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe heads off in a much darker direction by pitting an even more unhinged Wade Wilson against Marvel’s wealth of beloved heroes. The violence and gore from this one are off the charts, so prepare yourself for a Deadpool graphic novel that delves into his maniacal crusade against the superhero community.The multiverse always gives way to crazy interpretations of everyone’s favorite heroes and presents their origins & clashes with their Rogues’ Gallery in unique ways. Marvel Zombies takes readers to a wild sector of the Marvel multiverse that’s filled with zombified versions of the greatest superheroes of all time. The Ultimate Universe’s version of the Fantastic Four’s Reed Richards aka “Mister Fantastic” ends up in their crosshairs, which leads to some of the craziest storytelling in the Marvel Comics mythology.Marvel’s “Ultimate” line of comics offers a fresh spin on the long-standing legacy of its most iconic characters. Readers ended up falling in love with that spinoff universe’s version of Spider-Man, which is fulfilled by the teenage hero named Miles Morales. His origin story is contained within this graphic novel’s beautifully animated pages - you’ll end up falling in love with him too as he comes to grips with taking on the mantle of Peter Parker.If the Hulu TV series based on this collection of young heroes caught your attention, then you need to spend some time with the comic book series it's based on. The first volume of The Runaways introduces readers to the motley crew of Alex, Karolina, Gert, Chase, Molly, and Nico. Their lives are turned upside down once they learn that their parents are all super-powered baddies, which forces them to run away from home and seek out a life that differs from the one their evil parents abide by.Shang-Chi may have taken the spotlight as Marvel’s martial arts maestro, but that title once belonged to Danny Rand aka “Iron Fist.” This graphic novel provides answers to the biggest questions surrounding Iron Fist’s origin and everything that goes into the legacy of his superpowers. Prepare yourself for eye-popping flashback sequences that delve into the past wielders of the Iron Fist moniker.When Marvel transported its superheroes to the Elizabethan Era, a breath of fresh air arrived in the form of Marvel 1602. This focused timepiece tale sees our favorite Marvel heroes reside in England and clash with a powerful stable known as The Witchbreed. Spider-Man, the X-Men, Nick Fury, and a slew of even more Marvel saviors appear as alternate versions of their familiar selves as they navigate the dark reign of the year 1602.The “World War Hulk” storyline sticks out as one of those Hulk arcs that makes you feel for the big guy. After being exiled from Earth by the very same heroes he once fought side by side with, The Hulk finds himself wandering through space before taking refuge on the planet of Sakaar. Hulk soon finds himself in a struggle that places him on the side of the slaves who seek an uprising against their rulers. Hulk’s crusade alongside them eventually leads to him becoming their leader, which ultimately sets them all up for a violent return to Hulk’s home planet. For revenge, of course!Stan Lee and Jean Giraud’s masterful work together resulted in one of the best galactic tales ever told in comic book form. Silver Surfer: Parable features the space-faring champion as he fights to save Earth from two evil forces - Enslavers & Mrrungo-Mu and the all-powerful planet consumer known as Galactus. The climactic battles Silver Surfer is a part of are awe-inspiring, while the story’s themes of false prophets and human nature will keep you intrigued from start to finish.The creative duo of Grant Morrison and Jae Lee puts forth the well-known origins of Marvel’s First Family, the Fantastic Four, with a much darker tone. Fantastic Four: 1234 showcases each member of the superhero squad with their own singular stories, which all delve into some of the dysfunction at the heart of their innermost struggles and relationships. The striking art style and mature storytelling are much different than the Fantastic Four stories that came before this one.Frank Castle’s life is redefined by the team of Garth Ennis, Steve Dillon, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Tim Bradstreet in The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank. Frank’s return to prominence as a vicious vehicle for retribution against the worst criminals known to man has earned him the ire of two cops and the mob. Along with those opposers at his heels, Frank must contend with three individuals that try to co-opt his gameplan and have him join their group of vigilantes.One of the most beloved runs for Daredevil came during the late 90s. And that’s all thanks to Brian Michael Bendis and Alex Maleev. This defining series of stories follows the ground-level hero as his real identity becomes known to the world. And of course, this results in his most infamous foes doing everything in their power to make his life even more of a living hell. This comic book run also features some amazing guest appearances that make this a star-studded storyline worth checking out.The Ultimates are presented as a different interpretation of “Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.” The art style presented for this series grabbed everyone’s attention during its initial run and it’ll do the same for anyone that decides to check it out in this collection. You’ll definitely enjoy watching Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, and more as they combat familiar threats and confront a world overrun by varied supervillains.One of Spider-Man’s most notorious (and fan favorite) villains is Kraven the Hunter. In “Kraven’s Last Hunt,” the fearless warrior embarks upon a final feat in order to defeat his greatest adversary. After succeeding at his lofty goal, Kraven takes over Spidey’s role and ends up serving the city as a much more benevolent hero. Once Spidey escapes from Kraven’s grasp, he sets out to take back his role as the city’s savior.One of the most intriguing parts of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier Disney+ series is the way in which it explained the earliest example of super soldiers and the horrible acts committed by the U.S. government towards one of its patriots. Captain America: Truth delves into the tragic life of Isaiah Bradley, a soldier who donned the Captain America costume before Steve Rogers but was stricken by a horrible treatment by his superiors that speaks to real-world issues.Imagine a world in which superheroes are first introduced to the general public and, as a photojournalist, you set off to document their early days. Marvels, which comes from the combined efforts of Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross, presents that intriguing storyline in the most gorgeous fashion possible through some of the best-looking panels we’ve ever seen. This special edition of Marvels features extra content that focuses on the X-Men and even the aforementioned photojournalist that gets caught up in all the action.Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. drops a lot of humor into Marvel’s usual array of action-packed epics. The story follows a group of anti-terrorism specialists known as the Bizarre Weapons of Mass Destruction. But once Nextwave learns that their overseers are terrorists themselves, they become a bit peeved and set out to hand out some much-needed revenge. Get ready to laugh a bunch and most definitely get ready to remain excited throughout every explosive panel of this graphic novel.Chris Claremont and Frank Miller came together during the early 1980s to send Logan on an international journey that produced one of his finest acts to date. This storyline sees the highly celebrated X-Men member head off to Japan to rescue his beloved Mariko Yashida from an arranged marriage. But after facing firsthand embarrassment from Mariko’s father, Wolverine basks in his sorrows. Of course, you’ll get to follow his resurgence as a badass hero as he fights alongside a newfound assassin and clashes with the individuals trying to keep him from his true love.\n",

      "The Ten Best DC Comics Books, Right NowYesterday, Matt shared his picks for the best Marvel books, and tomorrow, David will share his thoughts on Image’s. This is a decidedly different list than either of theirs.Here’s why: slowly, DC has been reshuffling their creative deck and, due to that, are currently serving up the best books they have since… well, since the New 52 launched, honestly. Despite a number of great creators leaving the company, DC seems to have been finally placing the “right” creatives on many of their projects. Because of that, this was a much harder task than I had anticipated.Not that their line is in great shape; there are still quite a few books coming out that are pure trash, and a lot more that don’t distinguish themselves in any real way, featuring a ton of artistic fill ins, overly dark/violent turns for no real reason, and the same, Jim Lee-influenced art that dates the books quickly and permanently. It is also a list full of brand new books or brand new creative teams. In fact, only three of these teams have been on their assigned book for more than a year, and three of these books haven’t even been in print for a year, with two having debuted in the past two months. I took the “right now” caveat quite seriously.So, with those caveats laid out, enjoy the list!10. Batman/SupermanWritten by Greg PakIllustrated by Jae LeeWhy It Made the List: Despite a few hiccups, the Bat-corner of the New 52 has always been in pretty decent shape. The Superman side, on the other hand, has been a dumpster fire of epic proportions. With the upcoming film featuring these two characters already in production it was clear that there would be some sort of team up book coming, but I think few expected the book that we got.Aside from a forgettable middle arc featuring Brett Booth art, this book has been an exceptionally thoughtful and well-crafted book. Each line of dialogue and panel seems deliberate and measured, as if Pak and Lee and trying to get at the absolute core of who these characters are – not just now, but from all time.This is also one of the most stylized books that DC is putting out, which could be polarizing to some, but is rather exciting to me. Lee’s art is inimitable, and the tone he brings to the book is something that is closer to a prestige-format book than a monthly floppy. That further elevates Pak’s scripts to a place that feels somehow “above” current continuity – which, given some of the editorial choices elsewhere in the line, is a good place to be.9. Green Lantern CorpsWritten by Van JensenIllustrated by Bernard ChangWhy It Made the List: The best thing to happen to the health of the Green Lantern family of books was Geoff Johns stepping away from them, if only because it gave the four “team” books (not counting “Sinestro” or the soon to be departing “Larfleeze”) a chance to stake out their own identities and do some new things. Of all of these books, “Green Lantern Corps” has been the most consistently enjoyable since, and it is the book that, on the surface, changed the least. The “Corps” title has been used primarily to bring the concept of the Corps back to its core: these are, essentially, space cops.“Corps,” under the pen of Van Jensen and pencil of Bernard Chang, have embraced this role pretty flawlessly, letting the camaraderie become an essential part of the book, as well as the idea of following orders you don’t necessarily agree with. This book also has the most vibrant colors in DC’s entire catalog, courtesy of Marcelo Maiolo.  His presence on the book elevates it and, because of those bright, almost neon colors, and expressive, cartoon-ish style Chang brings, the visuals gives the book a feel not unlike the short-lived, and under-appreciated, Green Lantern: The Animated Series. That is a great touchstone for this book, as it means that the book is doing exciting, accessible, and enjoyable work.8. AquamanWritten by Jeff ParkerIllustrated by Paul PelletierWhy It Made the List: For the first 20+ issues, “Aquaman” was a book that was a huge commercial success, but left myself and a huge swath of the critical community cold. The character became unnecessarily dark and humorless, and the book became entangled with Antlantean politics to the degree that it ceased being about Arthur Curry, and instead was something more akin to a soap opera set under the sea.Enter Jeff Parker. Parker didn’t exactly turn the book into a “bwahahaha” revival, but he injected some much needed personality into the book, while keeping Paul Pelletier’s detailed, clean line. The supporting cast, while still dealing with Atlantis more than I’d care for, has become focused more on the small town of Amnesty Bay and Arthur’s relationship with the people he grew up with, both in Maine and on land in general.  Parker also adds a bit of super secret science, one of my favorite comic tropes, to the mix, along with some of the mythological fun from the “Wonder Woman” side of the DCU.  Taken all of that together, and the book has a really rich miasma from which Parker and Pelletier can pull from, to take Aquaman – a hero that can control 70% of the Earth – just about anywhere.  Plus, in the first issue of the run, Mera used her water powers to shoot him like a rocket into the atmosphere so he could punch a monster mega-hard. That’s just awesome.7. New 52: Futures EndWritten by Brian Azzarello, Keith Giffen, Dan Jurgens, and Jeff LemireIllustrated by Patrick Zircher and othersWhy It Made the List: I know this is risky – the book has been in publication less than a month and, at press time, has only had three issues come out, one of which was not nearly as strong as the other two. However, this series is doing something that’s different and playing with the expectations and realities of the New 52 in a way that no other series has since it launched almost 3 years ago.In my opinion, if DC had done a weekly spinning directly out of “Flashpoint” that could have connected some of the stray corners of the New 52 and given space for stories that didn’t necessarily carry enough weight for a series (like, say, “Blackhawks”), the initiative might have had more of a fighting chance to crawl into the public’s good graces. Instead they waited 30 months, but the results are more or less the same. It is fun to see Firestorm, Grifter, Stormwatch, etc, all popping up to get in on the action. Despite the book taking place five years in the future, we are finally getting some real world building.This book feels like the glyph that can unlock the potential of the New 52. And, from where we sit, this is one of DC’s better books. Of course, this could all fall apart, but couldn’t all of it?6. Justice League UnitedWritten by Jeff LemireIllustrated by Mike McKoneWhy It Made the List: Some of the best Justice League stories have taken place when the “Big 7” aren’t the core team on the book. I know DC has forgotten this over the past few years, but it remains true. When the book has a mixture of interesting characters, it doesn’t matter if they are the A list, or close to the C+ list – good writing and art will elevate any team to stardom (see: “Justice League International”).Enter “Justice League United” – Mike McKone has taken the team provided and created a unified (pardon the near pun) look that not only draws on their classic looks, but updates a few of them in ways that make sense, and aren’t just throwing a high collar on everyone.  The setting, thus far, of Northern Ontario also gives the book a location that isn’t simply a city or an orbiting base, but rather a visually unique, and culturally relevant, area to occupy.  And, if solicitations and interviews are to be believed, the team will also be all over the galaxy, which is a sadly under-utilized part of the DCU (outside of the Lantern books).  And Jeff Lemire, a Multiversity favorite from early on, has given these characters purpose and opportunity to be a team that can actually be something greater than the sum of its parts.  By both creating new characters, re-introducing old ones, and giving some from the stray corners of the New 52 a new lease on life, Lemire can craft a team that doesn’t rely on star power, or even a corner of the universe to occupy (like “Justice League Dark”), but rather a team that can be adaptable and handle whatever is thrown at them.Which, coincidentally, sounds a lot like the Justice League.  5. BatmanWritten by Scott SnyderIllustrated by Greg CapulloWhy It Made the List: This has become, along with “Wonder Woman,” the equivalent of rap and country. When I was a kid, a common (and stupid) response to “what kind of music do you like?” was “everything but rap and country.” Well, ask many readers now, “what do you read from DC?” they will answer “only Batman and Wonder Woman.” Snyder and Capullo were, initially, seen as a mismatched pair when this book was announced, but they have proven that they bring out the best in each other, and have now told three nearly year-long epic stories within the pages of “Batman,” and the pair seems to be going quite strong.Their dedication to the long form story is what sets this book apart, but it also is what keeps it at #5 on my list. If, for some reason, ‘Zero Year’ didn’t strike your fancy, well, the better part of a year is going to not interest you. These long form stories are best (and detractors may say, only) experienced from beginning to end. So, that also means that it is not the most new-reader friendly book on the shelves (although, to be fair, few of these are). That said, if you’re looking for a focused, blockbuster-style Batman story, you can’t go wrong with this book.4. Detective ComicsWritten by Brian Buccellato and Francis ManupalIllustrated by Francis ManupalWhy It Made the List: Look, I get it. Where do I get off putting a run two issues in in the fourth place position of this list? Well, a couple of things have led to this decision. The first being this: Buccellato and Manapul have emerged as one of the best creative pairs in comics today. The second is this: while this is the third Bat-related book on the list, this is the only one that doesn’t feel like it has a precedent set for it.This is the book that DC is literally named after, and a pretty good way to judge the health of their company is to look at how “Detective” is doing. And the book, post-new team taking over, looks like a pretty spectacular place to spend some time. For one thing, the book is about Batman actually thinking through an issue – it shows him being a detective. It also is one of the few books to escape from the biggest visual problem DC has right now, and that is its dull coloring house style. Most of the stories set in Gotham, especially, suffer from an overuse of drab browns and greys, and Buccellato, in his role as colorist, is not guilty of that at all.The most obvious thing about the book, from a physical production standpoint, is that (much like the next two books on the list) it doesn’t look like anything else on the shelves right now. The team has brought some of the eternal hopefulness from “The Flash” and, without changing who Batman is or what he is all about, made a book that feels more optimistic than any Bat-book has in a long time.3. Green ArrowWritten by Jeff LemireIllustrated by Andrea SorrentinoWhy It Made the List: It is no surprise that a few of the books on this list are self-contained entities, allowed to operate in their own little corner of the DCU without too much interference from other creators or crossovers. That is, more or less, the story of “Green Arrow” since Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino took over.In addition, the book took a risk by incorporating Diggle, a character created for Arrow, into the cast, and has done so more or less flawlessly. Part of the turnaround of this book, which was among the worst in all of comics before the current team took over, has been the absolutely incredible art by Sorrentino. One part David Aja, one part Sean Phillips, Sorrentino’s work is never dull, and brings a totally unique look to the book.It also is a book that isn’t afraid of the character’s own history, nor is it beholden to it.  An upcoming arc appears to be hinting at the tone/general concept of the famous “Longbow Hunters” arc, and yet I’m sure Lemire and Sorrentino have no interest in simply rehashing an old story.  They are doing exactly what the New 52 was supposed to do – tell good stories that didn’t require 50+ years of knowledge to enjoy them.  But when they tap into some of that history, it allows folks who grew up reading these comics a nostalgic tingle down their spine, without alienating the new readers.  Other creative teams: take note.  2. Wonder WomanWritten by Brian AzzarelloIllustrated by Cliff ChiangWhy It Made the List: This book is second only to “Batman” in terms of consistency over the first 30 issues, and might have the edge on the book in terms of quality per page (a new comics cum sabermetrics statistic I just invented). Led by the fearless Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang, they have crafted a world for Diana that feels almost completely removed from the DC universe proper.This is the perfect anecdote to the asshole who says “what makes Wonder Woman so special?” Her mythological origin has been updated with a powerful, emotional kicker which, although anathema to many long time fans, gave the book a hook that took the supporting cast from superfluous to essential.Although Chiang has only illustrated about half of the issues, his usual sub of Tony Akins is simpatico enough to stay within the lines Chiang established as the look for the series. This is one of the very few New 52 runs that has been long enough and good enough to stand alongside the most classic of DC stories, and will be surely missed come the end of the summer, when a new creative team takes over.1. Action ComicsWritten by Greg PakIllustrated by Aaron KuderWhy It Made the List: Greg Pak is the only writer currently working for DC who seems to really understand what makes Superman tick – and DC needs Superman to tick. I mentioned in the “Detective” write up that a good way to judge DC’s health is the success of “Detective” – while that is true, the heart and soul of DC has always been “Action Comics.” Nothing makes DC itself more than Superman. And for the first time in a long time, Superman seems to be in good hands.When Grant Morrison took over “Action” with the New 52, he said he wanted a book that always felt like it was moving. I found this quote curious, because his “Action” didn’t feel like that; this “Action” does, and a huge credit for that has to go to Aaron Kuder, who has grown into an absolute superstar. Each panel Kuder draws (which, sadly, isn’t all of them – he’s needed some fill-in help as he scripts the last arc of “Superboy”) leaps off the page with such gusto and personality that the book becomes infectious.“Action” has focused a lot on Lana Lang, and she, in many ways, is the avatar of the creative team. She’s the second or third most popular Superman love interest, she has been grossly underutilized in the past, and she is such a breath of fresh air when thrust into the spotlight. It might have taken DC 25 or so issues to get “Action” right, but once they did, they knocked it out of the park. Here’s hoping that, with its two signature books working extraordinarily well, a few new series kicking ass, and some of their most important properties heading in new directions, when I make this list this year, it is an even harder task.Brian Salvatore is an editor, podcaster, reviewer, writer at large, and general task master at Multiversity.

      "10 Greatest DC Superheroes Of All TimeThere's more to DC than the Justice League...It's hard to imagine what the world would look like without superheroes. The costumed do-gooders have been saving their respective fictional universes from unstoppable threats for almost a century, entertaining millions of fans through comic books and various film and TV adaptations. One of the driving forces behind the rise of the superheroes in comic books was DC Comics. Upon its inception in 1934, the company soon became a major part of a revolution that helped put superheroes on the map, as it created the likes of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, that was only the beginning.From metahumans to aliens (and everything in between), DC has introduced readers to a wide array of colourful crime-fighters over the past century. But with a roster of such rich characters, you can't help but wonder which of these revered heroes reigns supreme as DC's greatest creation?Commissioner Gordon's crafty daughter Barbara wanted to make the world a better place, and thus took the law into her own hands as lone vigilante Batgirl. After making a name for herself as a crime-fighter, she was officially welcomed into The Dark Knight's extended Bat-Family, becoming an integral part of the team. Though there already was a Batgirl in the comics, the classic sixties Batman TV series rewrote the character's origins (introducing her as Jim Gordon's daughter) and the comics did the same to keep in-line with the show. This has since become the definitive Batgirl.There are few characters in comic book history as resourceful as Babs. Whether she was fighting crime in the field as Batgirl or providing comms assistance as Oracle, she redefined what it was to be a female superhero - overcoming the odds, a male-dominated society, and working as Oracle to save people even after Joker's horrific attack.With an integral role on Batman's team, as well as being the voice of the Birds of Prey, Barbara has been involved in some of DC's most compelling storylines. Her popularity has sky-rocketed over the years, thanks to her starring roles in arcs like Batgirl Of Burnside - as well as her involvement in TV shows Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman.\n",

      "The 12 Greatest DC Superheroes of All TimeDC Comics is home to myriad superheroes and villains, including many of the most iconic characters to grace the comic book page. However, even within that vast universe of mythic figures, a few heroes soar above the rest, whether owing to their compelling backstories, visually interesting powers, or — in most cases — a combination of the two.So let’s take a look at our definitive list of the top 12 DC superheroes.As half of the Dynamic Duo, Dick Grayson began as Batman’s sidekick but broke out of his Boy Wonder binds to become a bona fide DC superhero in his own right. Nightwing uses the lessons he learned from his brooding mentor — minus the darkness, plus a glimmer of hope — to take down DC’s villains. He is the kinder, gentler Batman. Like his fellow DC superheroes Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, Billy Batson lost his parents when he was a child. Their untimely demise sent him on a righteous path to an ancient wizard, Shazam. The wizard bestowed the boy with the power to transform himself into an adult superhero of the same name by summoning a magic lightning bolt with one word: “Shazam!” When he first appeared in Whiz Comics No. 2 in 1940, Shazam outsold Batman and Superman, The New York Times reported. His popularity led to an eponymous 1974 live-action TV series, a 2019 Hollywood blockbuster, and its 2023 follow-up, Shazam! Fury of the GodsIt's official: Booster Gold is the worst gift-giver of all-time. What's your review of \"The Gift\" Part One in BATMAN #45? pic.twitter.com/gFzeleLeHfBooster Gold doesn’t have the name recognition of his Justice League contemporaries, but he’s no less important (and awesome), hence his inclusion on our DC heroes list. His comic series infuses much-needed comedy into the otherwise grim DC canon, as a time traveler from the future using his advanced technology to become a celebrity superhero.A few years ago, Warner Bros. even had plans for a standalone movie that many theorized would be DC’s answer to Marvel’s wildly popular Guardians of the Galaxy saga. But so far, nothing has materialized. Film writer Zack Stentz told The Fanboy Podcast in 2019 that the script is complete, but he’s waiting for the studio to make the next move. Much in the same way Marvel entrusted the future of its fledgling streaming universe to Daredevil, DC tagged the Green Arrow to launch its TV empire on The CW. The move paid off in spades, featuring the green-hooded archer in all his broody glory.Originally, DC was content to have him basically act as a Batman clone who used a bow and arrow. But in the years since his creation, Green Arrow has taken on a personality of his own, pushing the Justice League into a progressive, forward-thinking mindset.Do you know the cost of magic? Share your thoughts on JOHN CONSTANTINE: HELLBLAZER #12  #DCBlackLabel pic.twitter.com/tV9aKOnU11As the gatekeeper for all things supernatural, John Constantine plays an integral role among the DC superheroes. The skilled magician and resident demon-fighter leads the “Dark” iteration of the Justice League and is known for his trademark brown trenchcoat, snarky quips, and frequent chainsmoking.He wonderfully embodies the seedy underbelly of DC’s superhero world, protecting the planet from the spawn of Hell itself.Aquaman’s powers may not always be useful in a land-based battle, but there’s no denying his importance in the larger DC universe. As the King of the Seven Seas, he shoulders great responsibility while watching over all the creatures of our planet’s oceans.And Aquaman got even cooler when resident Hollywood badass Jason Momoa played the hero in the 2018 movie of the same name.A strong argument can be made for why Martian Manhunter is the most powerful hero in the Justice League. Possessing a wide range of psychic, physical, and sensory abilities, he’s a valuable ally among DC heroes. Beyond that, he also acts as an intriguing foil for Superman, as a fellow alien forced to watch his society come crumbling down around him.You can see him on The CW’s Supergirl, a live-action depiction he rightly deserves.Probably the most famous female comic book hero, Wonder Woman was the only member of the DC Comics “Trinity” —  alongside Superman and Batman — to never star in her own film. But that changed when Gal Gadot portrayed the character in the standalone blockbuster Wonder Woman.  Considering she is as powerful as Superman, Wonder Woman — whose origin story is steeped in Greek mythology — deserves to be as popular as her male counterparts. Given her 2017 film and 2020 follow-up, Wonder Woman 1984, casual fans finally learned how fascinating a figure she really is.Don’t let that 2011 Ryan Reynolds film fool you. Green Lantern may have yet to be effectively translated to live-action, but the character has a long-standing history as one of DC’s most powerful heroes.Like the Flash, numerous men have wielded the magical ring that is the signature of the intergalactic law enforcement group the Green Lantern Corps. However, all have proven to be strong additions to comic book lore — from Hal Jordan to John Stewart. It appears to be just a matter of time until the character’s name and the imaginative source of his powers finally achieve redemption in the eyes of casual superhero fans unfamiliar with his many successful appearances in comics and animated adaptations.The Flash may not have the same marquee value among non–comic book readers, but the character is catching up with his fellow Justice League members fast (after all, he is the fastest man alive). Often depicted as more fun and relaxed than most other top DC heroes, the character has long been a staple of the comics and finally broken into the mainstream, thanks to the hit series on The CW.Flash has also undergone loads of evolution over the years, with different men donning the suit. Regardless of which version of the character appears, the Flash is always a highlight, and his world — which frequently dabbles in time travel — never fails to create new and surprising stories.Undoubtedly one of the most popular heroes of all time, Batman serves as the perfect counterpoint to Superman in the comic books, offering a conflicted sense of darkness and brooding commitment in place of the Man of Steel’s clear view of the planet he serves.Classic works like The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke perfectly capture how morally complex and endlessly thrilling Batman’s world can be, thanks in part to his stunning rogues’ gallery of memorable foes.The Caped Crusader has also seen financial success, with his theatrical releases collectively raking in $2.4 billion to date, Box Office Mojo reports.Perhaps the most recognizable superhero ever created, Superman is probably also the one responsible for the explosion of the genre, as he predates virtually all of the heroes we love today.A paragon of truth and justice, the strongest DC character is known for his unyielding sense of righteousness. And although he has largely been difficult to capture on the big screen — at least since Christopher Reeve donned the red cape — even fans who criticized Man of Steel continue to stand by the last son of Krypton, whose tragic origin has yielded many epic comic book tales over the years.Additional reporting by Nick Cannata-Bowman.Check out Showbiz Cheat Sheet on Facebook! RELATED: ‘Batman’: The Real Reason the 1966 TV Series Was ‘So Corny’\n",

      "screenrant.comThe Best DC Comics Miniseries of 2019In 2019, DC Comics offered readers a wide variety of miniseries to chose from along with the regular ongoing series titles. Here are our favorites!DC Comics, along with the regular ongoing series, provided readers with a wide array of miniseries and limited series in 2019. 2019 saw DC Comics begin to embrace their new, more mature Black Label line of books along with the more whimsical and less serious offerings from the newly minted Wonder Comics line.DC's miniseries, for the most part, offered readers an opportunity not to have to worry about big events, such as the ongoing Year of the Villain, which was one of DC's bigger focuses of 2019. It should be noted that the following list is made up of those series that began and ended in 2019.Related: Will Superman's Powers Ever Let Him Die in DC's Universe?It was a complicated process to pick out which miniseries to include, especially since DC embraced the 12 issue maxiseries format for series such as Steve Orlando and Riley Rossmo Martian Manhunter, Greg Rucka and Mike Perkins' Lois Lane, and Matt Fraction and Steve Lieber's Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen to name a few. Those books began in 2019 and scheduled to end in 2020. The following are the miniseries that were the best of the best of 2019.Since his appearance during Dark Nights: Metal, the Dark Multiverse's the Batman Who Laughs has been one of the leading forces to be reckoned with in the DC Universe. This miniseries, which included a one-shot about the Punisher-esque Grim Knight, finally pitted Batman against the darkest version of himself, pushing him to his limits and beyond as Bruce was forced to come face to face with the nightmares spawned from the Dark Multiverse.Scott Snyder and Jock reunited for this project, which not only gave readers a great and exciting story but also laid the groundwork for The Infected and Hell Arisen story arcs, which is the final installment of the company-wide storyline Year of the Villain. Even though this series seemed to suffer from a staggering publishing schedule, the newest issue was always on the top of our \"to read\" stack.The creative powerhouse team of writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo, who essentially reinvented Batman in modern times, came together once again to tell the sprawling tale of the Dark Knight, who wakes up in the future and must embark on a quest through a devastated DC landscape. This miniseries, which was one of the first offerings published under DC's Black Label, found its genesis from a short story that Snyder wrote for Detective Comics #27  (vol#2) entitled \"27.\"  The original short story was about a machine that cloned a new Bruce Wayne every 27 years and was supposed to explain how Batman has managed to fight crime for 80 years.Along with the apocalyptic landscape of the DCU, Snyder and Capullo included many elements from their previous collaborations together, such as their The New 52 Batman series and Dark Nights: Metal. This series was not only a fun read but contained a cornucopia of easter eggs and references for fans of the DC Universe. Though billed as \"the last Batman story ever told,\" fans can hope that Snyder and Capullo return to this story in the near future.Related: The 10 Best Comic Book Creators of 2019Female Furies was a remarkable series that used the characters from Jack Kirby's Fourth World to paint a portrait of the abuse and oppression that women in a patriarchal society face, be it on Earth or Apokolips. The story not only centers around the members of the Female Furies and how they react to their leader Auralie's plight but also focuses on Granny Goodness and her struggle as the only female of Darkseid's male-dominated inner-circle.Written by Cecil Castellucci and combined with the energetic art of Adriana Melo, Female Furies not only recontextualized Jack Kirby’s Fourth World but also brought gave it a new and fresh look to the characters and their established histories. Melo's steller artwork imbued the series with a sense of weight and presented the characters in such a way that it accurately reflects their environment.While the \"in the face\" political overtones may have turned some readers off, the story is an accurate reflection of the empowerment and privilege in today's society. Put, this was one of the smartest, best drawn, social commentary series disguised as a comic book.Whereas DC's Black Label imprint focused on the more mature side of the DC Universe, the Wonder Comics imprint embraced the more whimsical and fun aspects of the universe. While Dial H for Hero is a great series, it was Mark Russell's Wonder Twins that stood out as the best miniseries for more than a few reasons. First, Russell was able to take two C-list characters and turn them into two of the most relatable characters in the DC Universe. Russell showed that Jan and Zana not only had to deal with the problems that superheroes face but also those of normal teenagers. Russell also brought in the social commentary aspects he is known for into the series. He not only got to tell a great and funny story but at the same time was able to bring it to the next level like he has done with his other projects at DC Comics like The Flintstones and GLAAD award-winning Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles.It is due to these reasons that it is no surprise that DC extended Wonder Twins from a six-issue miniseries into a twelve-issue run. It's worth checking out.If there was one miniseries on this list that is questionable about its inclusion, Event Leviathan is that entry.Event Leviathan was Brian Michael Bendis' project, which was supposed to change the landscape of the DC Universe. Spinning out of the events of Action Comics, Leviathan was responsible for destroying all the covert super-spy organizations and secret societies in the DC Universe in one fell swoop. Event Leviathan and followed a group of \"the DC Universe’s greatest detectives,\" as they tried to figure out who Leviathan was before they could strike again and reveal who was the mastermind was behind the mask.Even though Bendis maintained that Leviathan wasn’t a new character, but someone who existed in DC Comics canon, the final reveal of Leviathan's identity did leave many feeling cheated. What saved this series and qualified it to be included on this \"best of list\" was the artwork of Alex Maleev. Maleev, who has collaborated with Bendis on such memorable series as Daredevil and various Marvel and creator-owned properties, set the tone for the book and made the visual components of the story the reason to come back each issue.Related: DC's New BATMAN is Everything Fans Love About The Dark KnightOn the surface, DCeased seemed like it was DC's answer to the Marvel Zombies franchise. It proved to be a fast-paced series that focused on the idea of hope and perseverance in the face of devastating events.DCeased centers around the citizens and heroes of the DC Universe being assaulted by a terrifying disease that is spread through technology and turns people into zombielike creatures. This disease was the result of Darkseid bonding the Anti-Life equation with Cyborg's techno-organic components, which he then used to get back at the Justice League for stopping his invasion of Earth. The kicker was that no one was safe, and anyone from the regular citizen to the heroes and villains was considered safe from being zombified as the disease spread.Tom Taylor, the scribe of DCeased, is no stranger to alternate DC universes having writing other limited series such as Injustice: Gods Among Us. In DCceased, Taylor presented a fast-paced story along with excellent small moments between the characters throughout the series. While the ending of the six-issue miniseries seemed a bit rushed, it was well executed and feels like there is more of the story to be told in the future.More: The Best Marvel Comics Miniseries of 2019Chad Burdette is life long comic book reading and collector with many issues, some of which are bagged, boarded, and filed away.

There are also more hilarious stories within the comic book, such as why Drax has sworn off violence forever and why Groot can’t grow bigger. These Marvel comics were so popular that they were translated into two Marvel movies on the big screen! It was in 1962’s Amazing Fantasy comic book when Spider-Man was first introduced in the Marvel Universe. Before all of the ostentatious exposure he got teaming up with the Avengers, Peter was just a regular high schooler who gets bit by a radioactive spider. He stubbornly lets a thief run away, saying “he’s done being pushed around by anyone,” who later on kills his Uncle Ben. He recognizes the magnitude of his power and continues to learn why “with great power comes great responsibility.” In the tear-jerking The Night Gwen Stacy Died Marvel comic book, the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacy and uses her to lure Spidey to the Brooklyn Bridge. When Goblin and Spidey clash, Gwen gets hurled off the side of the bridge. Spidey shoots his web out and catches her but discovers she is dead. He blames himself for her death and seeks revenge on the Green Goblin but finds he cannot kill him. What happened to Gwen Stacy was revolutionary to Marvel history and other comic books as important characters were rarely killed off, much less the protagonist’s girlfriend. This case gave way to the birth of the Gwen Stacy Syndrome when wives or girlfriends of heroes suffered some grim fate. Also Read: When Did Disney Purchase Marvel Studios?Marvel: Annihilation is a crossover miniseries featuring the best stories of the lives of outer-space characters in the Marvel Universe. Thanos, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Annihilus, Galactus, and others are some of the stories this series follows. The X-Men go head-to-head against the supervillain Shadow King [1], who can control minds and get under the skin of many of our psychic heroes. He wants to use the X-Men to help him get back to the physical realm. Discontent with only the psychic heroes, he spreads his psychic powers all over London to possess its citizens as well. Several Marvel Avengers comic books have been present previously, but a few of them, including Mighty, New, Dark, and the Initiative, has been canceled to make way for the modern Avengers series released in 2010. In the Heroic Age of Marvel Comics, our favorite Avengers team gets into an epic battle of heroes and villains to save Earth from catastrophic threats. Also Read: Thor vs Captain MarvelThe Marvel: Black Panther comics are written by National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates. T’Challa is challenged by The People, a superhuman terrorist group, who aims to spark a revolution among the people in Wakanda and turn them against their king. T’Challa must choose to stand by tradition or do what is right by his people as their ruler. Steve Rogers is back in his own Marvel comics with a new shield, new teammates, and a new mission… working as an agent for Hydra. In this alternate timeline, we see how Captain America set up the stage during the Civil War, the nature of his relationship with the Winter Soldier, and how Hydra had taken an interest in him and fostered him ever since he was a child to make him their strongest Secret Soldier. In the Marvel: Civil War comic book series, our favorite superheroes are forced to perform missions with the law supervising them after a reality show literally bombs and kills over 600 people, including young students. The public turns against superhumans, calling them villains and freaks of nature. The biggest heroes Captain America and Iron Man take on opposing sides and recruit their team members, including Winter Soldier, Ant-Man, and the rest of the Avengers. This was adapted into the big screen, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America. Also Read: Black Widow ComicsMarvel Comics Daredevil: Born Again uses plenty of Catholic themes throughout the story. Writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli have received praise for their work, and it is considered one of the best, if not the best, Daredevil storylines. When his ex-girlfriend Karen Page sells his identity out to the Kingpin, Matt Murdock is left homeless after his home gets firebombed and bankrupt after the IRS froze all his accounts. He confronts the Kingpin but gets badly beat up. His unconscious body gets strapped to the back of a taxi that was pushed into the East River, but he wakes up just in time to swim to safety and makes his way to Hell’s Kitchen. There, he is found by his long-lost mother, Maggie, who serves as a nun in a Catholic church. Read: How Strong is Captain MarvelThe Darth Vader comics begin with Anakin Skywalker completely falling to the dark side of the Force and becoming Darth Vader to prevent the death of his wife as promised by Palpatine. Obi-Wan Kenobi kills him, but Palpatine retrieves his body and puts it inside a cybernetic armor to revive it. He eventually wakes up with nothing but pain and rage and wreaks havoc on the entire universe. Wisecracking Deadpool is back in his latest comic book series that old and new fans will come to love equally. This story gives us a fresh look at the character and what exactly makes him well-loved -- even more than Spidey (or so Deadpool thinks). In the Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again comics, MODOK uses special programming to control Deadpool into thinking that the Avengers Unity are his enemies. The character proceeds to kill all of them without hesitation, which leads a group of heroes, including breakout star Jessica Jones, Hawkeye, and Punisher, to investigate what is happening. We learn that Red Skull, Abomination, Doctor Doom, and Magneto are behind the MODOK programming. Written by Marvel geniuses Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, The Coming of Galactus tells the story of the Silver Surfer as he was working for Galactus, a cosmic entity who fed on planets to sustain his life source. The Fantastic Four notice that the skyline seems to be burning, leaving a trail of debris, which they closely examine. A powerful being named the Watcher appears and tells them that he has attempted to conceal the Earth’s presence from the Silver Surfer. The herald notices Earth hidden anyway and alerts Galactus. The edition’s cliffhanger ending shows us the cosmic entity declaring his intention to devour Earth, with the Fantastic Four on standby, ready to defend the world.  Written by major players in the comic book world Jim Starlin, George Perez, and Ron Lim, the Infinity Gauntlet story starts with Mistress Death resurrecting Thanos to correct a perceived imbalance of life forces. Because the Titan wanted to earn her good graces, Thanos collected all six Infinity Stones and attached them to his Gauntlet to do her bidding, but still, Death rejected him. The Mad Titan angrily wiped away half of all living beings. Doctor Strange summons all of the surviving heroes to defeat Thanos but fails. Because Thanos was under the impression that he’d all but defeated his enemies, he left his body and assumed an astral form, which eventually gave his daughter Nebula a chance to steal the Gauntlet and restore the universe to its previous condition. Also Read: Best Way To Watch the Marvel MoviesInfinity War has a total of six issues and is the sequel to Infinity Gauntlet by Jim Starlin. Adam Warlock takes possession of the Gauntlet and uses it to expel the evil side from his being, creating a completely different persona called Magus. Magus ran amok and created evil doppelgangers of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Old Man Logan is set in an alternate universe wherein the villains emerge victorious over superheroes. Superheroes have been all but extinct, with a few in hiding. Logan lives in Hulkland, part of California, with his family, but times are getting tough, and he needs money to pay rent to his landlords. He accepts a job from a blind Clint Barton to assist him in traveling east to deliver a package. When he gets back home, he discovers the Hulk Gang had killed his family due to their overdue rent payment. Wolverine unleashes his long-dormant claws and kills off every Hulk family member, not noticing that one family member was left. Together with baby Hulk, Wolverine says he plans to defeat all the new world villains to bring peace to the land and starts the modern Marvel superheroes with two new warriors. Peter Parker is back in New York for the Marvel: Spectacular series. This story is a take on the classic 1960s tale, with humorous dialogue and exciting fights with villains. He teams up with classic favorites like Iron Heart and Human Torch to take down Vulture, Kingpin, and other nostalgic villains. Read: Some Marvel Painting IdeasSecret Empire is a ten-issue modern Marvel storyline centering around Hydra’s control over Captain America. They made him believe that he was acting as a sleeper agent and setting the stage for Team Hydra to take over the world. There are nine issues in the Marvel: Secret Wars series, whose storylines center around the Marvel Universe's destruction and many different alternate universes. Each has its version of Earth, which combines in a planet called the Battleworld. Since there are many different Earths from many different universes, there are multiple versions of our favorite superheroes. It’s interesting to see how vastly different they are -- from their powers, personalities, and histories -- from the ones we are familiar with in the Marvel Universe. The 2016 modern Marvel edition tells us the story of Miles Morales, a biracial teen of Black American and Puerto Rican descent. He possesses powers similar to Peter's after being bitten by a spider infused with a formula created from Parker’s blood. He is unhappy about having powers; at the same time, his father also mistrusts superheroes, so he does not say anything. He gets in touch with Parker’s friends and loved ones, such as Gwen Stacy, Mary-Jane Watson, and even May Parker, who inspires him and tells him why Peter did what he did, and finally assumes the masked superhero role. The evilest villain in the Marvel Universe is back in his title series. He seeks vengeance on everyone who opposed him, especially the Avengers. This series is clever and interesting because we see destruction through the eyes of Thanos and learn of his reasoning on why he does what he does, with a great showdown on heroes and villains in its climax. Read: What's the Best Gift For a Marvel Fan?The first-ever issue of The Amazing Spider-Man by Steve Ditko, John Romita, and Stan Lee was released over 50 years ago in 1963. It tells the story of how Peter Parker juggles life as a high school student, son, and freelance photographer while saving the people of New York as the web-shooting masked crimefighter. Ultimate Spider-Man is a telling of the original story Marvel fans adore. A young Peter is orphaned at six years old and gets bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superhuman powers and a “spidey sense,” which warns him of impending danger. He learns the gravity of the phrase “with great power comes great responsibility,” and tries his best to do good. Weapon X is a clandestine program conducted by Department K in Canada that experiments on both mutants and humans. In this story, mutants are turned into weapons by further enhancing their powers, while humans are mutated in order to give them powers. Plenty of funding and research are given to this program to kill none other than their high-stake target, Wolverine. Legion, son of Professor X, decides to travel back in time to kill Magneto before he can start committing heinous crimes. Little did he know, he travels to a time when Magneto and Professor X were still friends, and Professor X died saving his friend. This sacrifice results in Magneto having a change of heart and following through with Professor X’s vision, which was humans and mutants coexisting peacefully. Apocalypse, a time-traveling immortal mutant, rules over the world and sees that all humans are killed as revenge for the past. X-Men: Blue is a bi-weekly publication with 36 issues from 2017 to 2018. This series follows the aftermath of the Inhumans vs. X-Men war, wherein the five original X-Men, including Marvel Girl, Cyclops, Beast, Iceman, and Angel, are looking to bring mutant criminals down to bring justice to their team. In the Days of Future Past story, we see a dystopian present-day United States ruled by Sentinels, who hunted and tracked down mutants all over the world to place them in internment camps and kill them via a nuclear holocaust. The few remaining members of the X-men send Kate Pryde back in time to stop a defining event that greatly contributed to the present happenings. Unlike X-Men: Blue, the Gold team features newer heroes spearheaded by Shadowcat, or Kitty Pryde. Along with Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Prestige, and Old Man Logan, she is on a mission to become Earth’s heroes and defend the same people who hate and fear them because of the traumatic events of the Inhumans vs. X-Men battle. Written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the Dark Phoenix Saga story revolves around Jean Grey, who gets exposed to the deadly radiation of a solar flare. She attains the highest power of telepathy and telekinesis called the Phoenix Force. She then assumes the identity of Phoenix, a being of pure thought, and makes her a target for Mastermind, who successfully controls and manipulates her and the Phoenix Force to do his bidding. To this day, the Dark Phoenix saga remains one of the best stories about the X-men. Our best advice for those planning to get into Marvel Comics is to pick one superhero and story you know and start there. Personally, we loved reading Iron Man comics simply because of the familiarity of the stories. And sure, some things in the Marvel comics have been told differently in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and TV series, so you may have to unlearn some stories along the way. Marvel Comics hasn’t released an official record of all of its comic book titles, so the best we could come up with is an estimate. In 2009 -- about ten years ago -- Marvel reported having 32,000 comics in its arsenal, which is about 450 per year since they released their first issue in 1939. Multiply 450 by ten, and you’ll have about 36,000 comics in total, more or less. Suppose you read all 36,000 issues of Marvel Comics. Each Marvel comic has around 60 to 68 pages, which we presume an average person finishes in about 15 minutes. If readers spent 24 hours everyday reading, it would take them a year (375 days) to finish all the Marvel Comics. Of course, you have to sleep and eat, so consider that, too. Marvel comics is a wide universe filled with rich stories of heroes and villains. There’s a reason why they’ve been around since the 1930s -- their stories are gripping, touching, and heartwarming. With clever dialogue and colorful sketches, it would seem like the Marvel characters are leaping off the pages as you read. If you’re interested in Marvel Comics merch, check out our listings! References: Connecting people with their favorite pop-culture products every day.\n",

      "You voted on the best DC Comics stories of all time, and these are your resultsThe DC Universe is one of the longest-running superhero universes in fiction - in fact, the American version of the genre started with the debut of Superman in 1938's Action Comics #1.In the decades since, DC has been home to some of the greatest superhero stories ever - and these are the very best DC stories of all time as decided by Newsarama's readers.How do you eulogize the history of a character in two short issues? That's the question Julius Schwartz sought to answer, and he hired Alan Moore to do it - and he did with 'Whatever Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow?.'With the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths effectively ending the Silver Age, Schwartz imagined that his last two issues editing the Superman line were to be the last in human history. In two short issues, Alan Moore created a road map through Superman's history that included his most fearsome villains and his closest friends.And ultimately, he gives the man who has everything the one thing he lacked: a perfect ending. Part of the reason that this is such a pitch-perfect tribute to the Man of Steel is that legendary artist Curt Swan handled the art. He had been drawing Superman since 1948 and from the opening letters \"This is an imaginary story\" to that final, knowing wink from 'Jordan Elliott,' this one feels like a Superman story through and through.It honors the legacy of one of the world's greatest heroes while simultaneously thumbing its nose at the continuity changes that were to take place.Buy: AmazonIn the wake of Crisis On Infinite Earths, Wally West became the new Flash, graduating from sidekick to superhero with the death of his mentor Barry Allen. Wally's transition wasn’t without growing pains, however. He failed to gel with readers until Mark Waid began his landmark run on Flash, giving Wally the depth that his predecessor had often lacked.While it’s hard to argue that there was ever a lull in Waid's original Flash run, 'The Return of Barry Allen ' is likely its apex. In this story, Wally is confronted with the return of the deceased Barry Allen – a story that, under another writer's pen, might have been heartfelt schmaltz, but for Waid, was an examination of Wally's ascent to true heroism, and the moment that solidified him as the one true Flash.Over the course of six issues, Wally and Barry struggle to share the mantle of the Flash until the truth of the return is revealed. Written in a conversational style reminiscent of Wally recounting the tale to a friend, it's as much a conversation between Waid and readers about legacy and heroism as it is between the characters on the page.'The Return of Barry Allen' is something of an unsung pioneer of modern comic books, blending an everyman perspective with a modern narration and a grasp of classic ideals that make it one of the best examples of late 20th-Century superhero storytelling, and one of the best DC stories of all time.Buy: AmazonWhen 'The Judas Contract' began in New Teen Titans #42, the surprise wasn't Terra's apparent heel turn. Marv Wolfman and George Pérez had spent nearly a year introducing Terra to the Titans and making her part of the group and then letting readers in on her terrible secret months before the Titans would learn her true nature.The shock of that issue was just how totally and thoroughly she and Deathstroke owned the Titans because she knew all of their secrets at that point. At the height of their creative energies, Wolfman and Perez's stories were about the unique individuals that made up the Titans. All of the characters are so strong that the introduction of a wildcard like Terra to the team was a great way to shake things up.'The Judas Contract' also focuses on the story of Dick Grayson versus Deathstroke as the two warriors maneuver their allies to counter the other's forces, culminating in the one-time Robin's transition to his new superheroic persona as Nightwing. Just as Grayson moves out of his mentor's shadow, this story proves that the Titans are much more than just a Justice League junior varsity team.Buy: AmazonFor years, the Green Lantern Corps stood as the universe's best and brightest, defending the galaxy through the use of the most powerful weapon in the cosmos — their emerald power rings.But with the action-packed space opera epic 'The Sinestro Corps War,' Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons, along with A-list artists such as Ivan Reis and Patrick Gleason, showed Hal Jordan and company they weren't the only ring slingers in town.Featuring the debut of the fear-powered Sinestro Corps, 'Sinestro Corps War' was a pivotal moment for the Green Lanterns as both an organization and as a franchise, with a murderer's row of iconic DC supervillains thrown against the team, including Parallax, Cyborg Superman, Superboy-Prime, and the Anti-Monitor himself. Yet this book also had key moments of the Green Lanterns rising to this unprecedented challenge, with beats such as John Stewart trading interstellar sniper fire with the hermit crab-like creature known as Bedovian, the Guardians revoking their eons-old edict against killing, or the promotion of Daxamite Green Lantern Sodam Yat as the new, all-powerful Ion as he tackles the unstoppable Kryptonian Superboy-Prime.Culminating with some huge battles and personal redemptions, 'Sinestro Corps War' also led to a greater expansion of the Green Lantern universe as a whole, hinting at the rise of five more corps based on the colors of the emotional spectrum. This explosion of creativity and action not only solidified this as one of the greatest Green Lantern stories but one of the greatest DC stories in history.Buy: Amazon30+ years after its original four-part release, Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley's The Dark Knight Returns is undeniably one of the most powerful Batman stories ever told. A violent tale acted out behind a backdrop of Cold War paranoia and nightmares of a teenage uprising, The Dark Knight Returns follows Batman as he comes out of retirement to wage war against a Gotham City that will no longer tolerate one man taking the law into his own hands.Miller's Bruce Wayne is a silver-haired cowboy dropped into an '80s dystopia, a burly bag of aching bones who finds himself physically outmatched by a new generation of vicious gangs and the return of his arch-nemesis the Joker. Finally, as nuclear war breaks out between the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, it's up to Superman to take down a Batman hell-bent on cleaning up Gotham's streets.Although written and illustrated when Miller was just 29, The Dark Knight Returns feels like the work of a much older man. It's a satirical look at the evolving media landscape of the '80s when TV became more youth-oriented and even the news began to turn towards entertainment, as exemplified by the many talking heads who narrate the book's events in ways that benefit their own twisted agendas.Although time and countless issues of a harder-edged Batman have since softened the original impact of Frank Miller's pessimistic take on the World's Greatest Detective, its place in comic book history cannot be understated. For that reason alone, 'The Dark Knight Returns' deserves a place in every reader's library.Buy: AmazonIn a modern era of cynicism in comic books, the late Darwyn Cooke was able to showcase the latent optimistic potential of the DC Universe in the now-classic New Frontier. The story is everything that Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns aren't, with DC's marquee characters exhibiting their best traits and inspiring the world and readers alike to fight towards a better tomorrow at the dawn of the nuclear age. Cooke captures an America fresh from World War II and before a cultural shift where the only way comic books could be respected was if they were dragged through the gutter first.New Frontier is unabashed in its love of the superhero as an icon for what humanity could strive towards. Often under-served characters like Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Adam Strange are given their best interpretations here. Cooke simultaneously gets to the core of these characters and, through this, reinvents them at the same time.Cooke's art is a perfect marriage of influences from DC's storied history - from Jack Kirby to the Fleischer Superman cartoon and Batman: The Animated Series. Even the creator's art style brings out the best of DC's Silver Age with each hero smiling into the sunrise in a post-war art deco style. Darwyn Cooke's magnum opus, New Frontier is a portrait of DC's best side and embodies all the courage and hope that these characters represent in a perfect love letter to the Silver Age of comic books.Buy: AmazonGrant Morrison's intent with the 12-issue series All-Star Superman, one that took almost three years to finish its original publication run, was to create a Superman story that was both fresh and timelessly classic. He does so by tasking the simple question of how Superman would spend his last days on Earth.In a way that's an antidote to his previous exploitative death of the '90s, Superman is seen completing a series of tasks, or 'trials' in the most mythical (or perhaps even biblical) sense. It's a narrative that celebrates everything we have ever loved about the Last Son of Krypton. Morrison funnels his encyclopedic knowledge of the Man of Steel into a singular story in a way that never feels didactic, allowing cameos and appearances from virtually every era of Superman comics without ever needing to crack open the Multiverse to do so.Stripping the character down to his most heroic of essentials, Frank Quitely makes a career-defining turn on the book, casting the hero as a super relaxed version of a near-omnipotent alien. From the barrel-chested Superman, a logical extension of what the ultimate human being would look like, through to the polar opposite in the vulnerable Lex Luthor, Quitely has a way of capturing both the majesty and the humanity of these characters.All-Star Superman remains a quintessential Superman story for new readers through to those with much deeper long-boxes.Buy: AmazonLegion of Super-Heroes' 'The Great Darkness Saga' is one of the oldest stories on this countdown, and hasn't seen many references in the modern DC Universe, but it stands steadfast as an example of what DC stories can accomplish when they combine the classic with the nouveau and find common ground in disparate ideas.'The Great Darkness Saga' tells the tale of Darkseid, dark lord of Apokolips, making his way into the 31st century. The story brought together numerous villains of the Legion of Super-Heroes, uniting them with aspects of the 20th Century DC Universe. It defined the era of the Legion and set the stage for what came for years after.'The Great Darkness Saga' is not just the highlight of Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen's run on Legion of Super-Heroes, it's one of the greatest tales of the modern DC Universe, and a prime reason so many fans still clamor for the Legion even when they aren't part of DC's line.Buy: AmazonDC's continuity leading up into the '80s was rich with nostalgia but convoluted with inconsistencies, leading to the first real mega-event in the company's history: Crisis on Infinite Earths, which shook DC to its core, remixing its timeline and heralding the beginning of a continuity-shuffling practice repeated every decade since.Introducing the literally earth-shattering threat of the Anti-Monitor, this Crisis threw together dozens of heroes from across the Multiverse and was the scene of the then-shocking deaths of Barry Allen and Supergirl. Marv Wolfman and George Pérez juggled a universe full of characters, packing together more panels and action in one issue than many modern series fit into a trade. Earths lived and Earths died, resulting in a true epic that has withstood the test of time 30 years later.The legacy of Crisis also cannot be overlooked, with the streamlined continuity establishing Wally West as the new Flash, and launching into well-received series such as John Byrne's Man of Steel, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman arc 'Year One' and George Pérez's Wonder Woman run.Buy: AmazonKingdom Come, Mark Waid and Alex Ross's tale of the old guard of DC heroes facing obsolescence in a world protected by a younger and more vicious generation of superheroes is just as powerful now as it was when it was first published in 1996.Thanks to Waid's understanding of the titanic personalities he handles, his presentation that makes them feel human instead of lofty gods, and Ross' gorgeous painted visuals, Kingdom Come is often the first book mentioned when people are asked what their favorite DC stories are.While Kingdom Come stands as an emotional testament to Mark Waid's almost superhuman knowledge of the DCU and Alex Ross's immense talent behind a brush, it also rewards readers who find themselves coming back again and again to Waid and Ross's dystopian Elseworlds series. Whether it is the fact that Ross used the image of his own father, a reverend himself, as the inspiration for point-of-view character Norman McCay or Waid's cameo-filled final showdown that still reveals new heroes amid the din of battle, this story feels new with every reread despite being on shelves for over 20 years.Kingdom Come is a classic in every sense of the word, and continues to stand as the best story that DC has produced – and with 2021 marking the 25th anniversary of the story's release, we expect some renewed attention from DC.Buy: AmazonLove comics but don't know where to start?

      "Weird Science Marvel ComicsMarvel Comics Best of 2020: Year in ReviewIt has been one heck of a year. I think everyone would agree, including Comic Book Publishers, Writers, Artists, and Editors alike. The big companies have had to make cutbacks, distributors have had setbacks, and physical stores have struggled to find their place throughout the new normal of COVID. However, even with these conflicts, amazing stories have still been pumped out by some of the very best creators and thinkers in comics today. Sure, we’ve all strived to find our new normal. Nevertheless, comics have been there throughout all of this as an escape from the everyday trials and hardships that are ever impacting the entire planet.With that said, this article is more of a thank you to Marvel Comics, its writers, its artists, and its entire staff for the hard work they’ve done throughout this entire year. It takes a village to raise a child. And, it takes an army to make a great comic. So, here is my “BEST OF MARVEL COMICS” for the year 2020. Before I begin, let me once again say “Thank you” to everyone at Marvel from the publicists to the writers and everyone between. Without all of you, 2020 would have been so much more unbearable.Now, this commentary could focus on so much more. However, I’m just going to hit on three key areas: Writer of the Year, Artist of the Year, and Book of the Year all at Marvel Comics. Sprinkled in, I will hand out some honorable mentions to spice up the article. Again, everyone at Marvel deserves some praise. Nonetheless, the individuals I name are who I think were at the top of their game in 2020. Amazon Links will be attached for you to snag all of these outstanding comics and work from these artists and writers. I hope you enjoy it and God Bless!Let’s begin with some honorable mentions. The first artist on my shortlist would be German Peralta. This year he’s worked on STRIKEFORCE and MAESTRO with some KING IN BLACK items on the horizon. Now, I wasn’t a huge fan of STRIKEFORCE. Still, that had nothing to do with the art. With MAESTRO as his main focus, Peralta has done a stellar job locking this reviewer into the series with some extremely monumental illustrations that are almost next level involving the Hulk. Another honorable mention goes to Stephen Segovia for his work on HELLIONS, CONAN SERPENT WAR, EMPYRE: X-MEN, and GIANT-SIZE X-MEN: A TRIBUTE TO WEIN AND COCKRUM. His style is very distinctive and incredibly vibrant which ultimately lends itself well to the unique X-team in HELLIONS.Continuing with more honorable mentions, there is Nic Klein (who mainly focused on THOR) and Phil Noto who spread his artistic chops throughout the Marvel Landscape in 2020 from DR. STRANGE, CABLE, X-MEN, and a variety of covers including STAR and SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: ALIEN REALITY. Together, these two both added their extraordinary artistic mark on their respective comics. Noto’s almost painted, yet overly realistic style of our favorite heroes appears natural, sometimes muddy, but exceptionally rich and textured. However, on the other hand, Klein’s THOR is sharp, bright, crisp, and almost surreal. Each artist offers something different to their respective comics that helped drive their stories to the top of my list in 2020. Nevertheless, the award for BEST ARTIST AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to Joe Bennett!Joe Bennett, known primarily for THE IMMORTAL HULK, THE IMMORTAL SHE-HULK, and a variety of covers from MAESTRO to KING IN BLACK: IMMORTAL HULK, exudes his own frightfully violent style that’s scary good. Bennett is what has made THE IMMORTAL HULK such a huge success and has morphed everyone’s favorite Green Goliath into a horror comic. Readers, some of Bennett’s illustrations are so graphic and so unnerving, that I strongly recommend you don’t read THE IMMORTAL HULK at bedtime. In each issue, Bennett’s illustrations become more and more vivid, violent, and grotesque… but in such a way that truly amplifies the narrative. This year, Dispatch’s award for Artist of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the brilliantly talented Joe Bennett. If you’re not reading his comics, you need to get them on your pull list ASAP!Just like Artist of the Year, let’s kick things off with some honorable mentions. I’m going, to begin with, one of my all-time favorite writers, Jonathan Hickman. This year, The Head of X, strung together X-MEN, parts of NEW MUTANTS, multiple GIANT-SIZE X-MEN, and pioneered X OF SWORDS. Now, X OF SWORDS was… ok… but it was no HOXPOX, which is ultimately why I can’t give my boy Hickman the title this year.Continuing with my honorable mentions, let me focus on the “first-class” of X-Men writers this year: Ben Percy, Gerry Duggan, and Zeb Wells. Percy led the charge immediately after Hickman with X-FORCE, WOLVERINE, WEAPON PLUS: WORLD WAR 4, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and he even dabbled on MARAUDERS with CARNAGE: BLACK, WHITE, AND BLOOD on the horizon for 2021. His hands are all over Marvel Comics write now and that makes this comic fan extremely happy. He’s the perfect fit for WOLVERINE and X-FORCE championing some truly intriguing stories while keeping the character’s voices intact. He’s a genuine rock star at Marvel right now and I can’t wait to see what he has on deck for 2021.Now, if Percy is Hickman’s right-hand man, then Duggan is unequivocally his left-hand man. Duggan, who’s managed MARAUDERS, SAVAGE AVENGERS, CABLE, WOLVERINE: BLACK, WHITE, AND BLOOD, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and even contributed on WOLVERINE, has become a staple to Marvel Comics. His take on Kitty Pryde is outstanding. Plus, Duggan has taken the extremely unlikeable concept of Kid Cable and made him digestible and interesting. Readers, that’s a task I wouldn’t wish on any writer, yet Duggan has done it masterfully. Additionally, he’s had the amazing opportunity of weaving CONAN THE BARBARIAN into the modern Marvel Landscape within the pages of SAVAGE AVENGERS, which is such a fun title everyone should be reading. I just can’t say enough about Duggan.Now, I know these honorable mentions have been extremely X-MEN centric, however, it can’t go overlooked without mentioning Zeb Wells and the work he’s done this year with ANT-MAN, HELLIONS, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and SPIDER-HAM. Readers, HELLIONS is no doubt my surprise series of the year. After some epic flops like FALLEN ANGELS, I wasn’t expecting much from the series. Nevertheless, HELLIONS and Wells are a true delight. His take on Mister Sinister is the perfect blend of snarky, sarcastic cynicism that I never knew I needed in my pull list. Plus, the band of Misfits he’s put together makes for a wildly fetching team. Give HELLIONS a look and let me know what you think!Nevertheless, even after all of these honorable mentions that were remarkably X-MEN heavy, my writer of the year has absolutely nothing to do with the X-MEN. This year, the award for BEST WRITER AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to Peter David! David, who’s spearheaded so many original titles like SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: KING IN BLACK, SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: ALIEN REALITY, and MAESTRO, has been a breath of fresh air this year for both Peter Parker and Bruce Banner. Sure, these stories take place in alternate realities. But, both take aspects of the characters that David wrote many moons ago and has found a way to traverse these ideas into the future of Marvel Comics.Both of these stories are utterly fascinating, incredibly entertaining, and exceedingly creative. Almost every issue of each of these titles has been a spectacular hit. For the older fan, these have elements of nostalgia mixed with a new age twist that show David hasn’t lost a step. I highly recommend any newer reader to check some of Peter David’s past work out. He’s been in the business for quite some time and I think you’ll be pleased with what you find. This year, Dispatch’s award for Writer of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the dazzlingly talented Peter David. If you’re not reading his comics, you need to get them on your pull list ASAP!Marvel fans, this award is always more difficult to hand out each year. There are always some series that just start towards the end of a year, as well as some comics that ended early on in which we all forget. Plus, I place my criteria on this award that also entails a bit of longevity. Meaning, I try to only hand this award out to a series that’s been around for a minimum of 6-8 issues. That said. I would just like to mention one of my favorite titles in which I’m giving an honorable mention simply because it falls short of my criteria. Otherwise, it may have won the award. And that comic is MAESTRO by Peter David. This book has been an action-packed, nonstop success. It’s done so well that David is continuing the series this month with MAESTRO: WAR AND PAX. David takes his FUTURE IMPERFECT story and gives it a “prequel” with a spin. If you haven’t read it, get the MAESTRO trade and tell your shop you want MAESTRO: WAR AND PAX on your pull list. Additionally, if the concept of an evil, tyrant Hulk is new to you, grab the FUTURE IMPERFECT trade! You won’t be disappointed.The next honorable mention that fits the bill is DAREDEVIL by Chip Zdarsky. Now, Zdarsky is also one of my favorite writers right now. However, I merely didn’t put him in my writer’s honorable mention because he’s only done DAREDEVIL and X-MEN/ FANTASTIC FOUR this year. And let me tell you, I was very unimpressed with X-MEN/ FANTASTIC FOUR. Nonetheless, DAREDEVIL has been cerebral, unique, emotional, and massively significant to the character Matt Murdock. Murdock has changed drastically and has been battling some demons all year. And the irony, Zdarsky is more known for his humor and wit. However, some of the very best comics he’s ever written have been so emotionally charged. I can’t say enough about this title that has slid to the top of my pull every month. I won’t spoil the story for you BUT I will tell you to grab some DAREDEVIL trades posthaste! Zdarsky is such a gifted writer that truly deserves our praise this year.My last set of honorable mentions will solely be a group of titles… and those titles are X-MEN, X-FORCE, and WOLVERINE. These titles, forerun by Jonathan Hickman and Ben Percy are the top dogs of X-Men Comics at Marvel. Simply put: these are the three titles that you must read if you’re an X-fan. Sure, I do like many other titles. Nevertheless, if you had to make cuts in a time where money is tight, these are the three X-titles to grab. X-MEN is the flagship book that helps maintain the status quo each month written by the Head of X, Jonathan Hickman himself. This series gives you Cyclops, Jean, Magneto, Xavier, and the rest of the Quiet Council in all its glory. Ben Percy leads the charge with the two most high octane X-titles on the market in X-FORCE and WOLVERINE. Both of these titles have Logan (a fan favorite) deeply engaged and both titles focus on the war that’s been raging with humanity since HOXPOX and the creation of Krakoa. Furthermore, the best titles involved in the X OF SWORDS crossover event also happened to be these three titles as well.So, with all honorable mentions aside, my book of the year happens to be the very same as 2019. This year, the award for BOOK OF THE YEAR AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to THE IMMORTAL HULK! Now, I know what many of you are probably thinking… why? Other than Joe Bennett, you’ve barely mentioned anything about this title throughout the article. Well, let me start by saying Bennett is a huge reason as to why this comic is so dang successful. Without him, this series would be typical and ordinary. It’s Bennett that makes this series almost transcendent.Many would argue that if THE IMMORTAL HULK is your book of the year, then Al Ewing should have made your honorable mentions for writers. This is true. And, I struggled with that concept myself. However, this was the only work of his that I rather enjoyed. Plus, he had his fair shake at an event this year in EMPYRE that was a bit lackluster in my opinion. However, when Ewing has the opportunity to focus on one specific character and mold it to his will, he always does a fantastic job, which is the case in THE IMMORTAL HULK.Readers, Bennett and Ewing are doing something special here. Furthermore, how often has a creative team been on a book that’s been consistently on fire? Hardly ever! When THE IMMORTAL HULK graced the pages at Marvel, it was a genuine Fresh Start that’s continued 40 issues later. This series is scheduled to end at issue 50 and I for one am not looking forward to that day. Many recent writers at multiple companies have tried to write their 100 issues of a character (cough… cough… Tom King). However, their stories ebbed and flowed worse than a rollercoaster ride.THE IMMORTAL HULK has had very few duds in its over 40 issue run. It’s got action, suspense, thrills, and amazing cliffhangers that keep you coming back for more. It’s taken average B to C list characters and weaved them into the story as key players within the narrative while developing the multiple personalities inside Banner in the process. It’s explosive, diabolical, and volatile with the art telling just as much of the story, if not more than the writer. This year, Dispatch’s award for Book of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the bizarrely masterful IMMORTAL HULK. If you’re not reading this series, you need to get it on your pull list before it’s too late! And even if it’s too late, grab the trades ASAP!It’s been one heck of a year. I don’t think anyone would disagree. Even at Marvel Comics, we’ve seen a plant verse zombie verse human space war in EMPYRE, a Mortal Kombat style tournament that has ushered in hundreds of new mutants in X OF SWORDS, and now the KING IN BLACK has come as the year reaches a close. For a year encompassed by a pandemic, Marvel Comics has delivered some remarkable stories by extraordinarily talented individuals. I would once again like to thank everyone involved from top to bottom for the hard work they put forth this year. It’s because of these outstanding individuals that many of us have been able to survive and find some sort of escape this year. I hope that Marvel Comics can continue on this path throughout 2021 and I can’t wait to see what’s next for so many of my favorite characters, writers, artists, and series. Once again, Amazon Links were attached above for you to snag all of these excellent comics. Thank you once again to everyone involved and Thank you all so much for the read and continued support.

      "Columbia College Chicago© 2015 Columbia College Chicago Best DC Comics of 2019Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJune 28, 2019 by Dave 1 Comment 2019 has been a challenging year for DC Comics, with operational changes leading to layoffs throughout the publishing arm, and high profile series like Heroes in Crisis suffering from extensively negative reviews. Many of the publisher’s most memorable 2019 events are exercises in crisis control, from Batman: Damned‘s “Bat-Penis” controversy (see also: sentences I’ve always dreamed of writing) to the early removal of Tom King from Batman.Even with this, DC has published plenty of great stories, and continues to build an impressive network of top tier creative talent. Since acquiring Brian Michael Bendis from Marvel in 2018 (it wasn’t actually a sports style trade, but I prefer to phrase it that way), DC has also added the following list of heavy hitters:This is on top of pre-existing universe architects like King, Geoff Johns, and Scott Snyder (among many others!).The end result is a seemingly endless stream of ongoings and miniseries on my pull list of comics I collect week in and week out. We’re entering year 4 of the DC Rebirth era, and that’s an admittedly difficult spot to be – the thrill of the “new” has worn off, and now DC faces a lot of questions about what they want their universe to look like for the long haul.These are the comics that are doing it best in 2019.Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!This is a borderline best-of for me because in many ways Aquaman still feels more like a draft prospect than a fully fleshed out player – even with complete arcs published, the creative vision of Deconnick and Robson Rocha feels like a lot of untapped potential.But oh that potential! There’s plenty of interesting world-building occurring in the early parts of Deconnick’s time writing an amnesiac Arthur Curry, and Rocha’s approach to storytelling makes for a visually compelling comic. I definitely think the best is yet to come on Aquaman, but even so, it remains one of the more interesting DC Comics of the year.If you’re surprised to find Hawkman among DC’s best of 2019, well, so was I. Nonetheless, Robert Vendetti and Bryan Hitch have been hard at work on (arguably) DC’s most underrated title, spinning the return of Carter Hall (via DC Metal) into an extremely fresh take on the complicated character.After an inconsistent run on Justice League to kick off DC Rebirth, Hitch is back to conveying incredibly cinematic visuals on the page, as he and Vendetti lean into Hawkman’s roots as an archaeologist. I don’t exaggerate when saying this is the most I’ve ever liked Carter Hall.It hasn’t received even a fraction of the hype, but Female Furies is a worthy companion piece to Tom King and Mitch Gerad’s Mister Miracle. Making Granny Goodness a sympathetic figure, and a clear target of an inherent patriarchy at the center of Apokolips is no easy chore, and Female Furies not only succeeds, but entertains while doing so.Through the six issue miniseries, Cecil Castelluci and Adriana Melo dig into the harsh realities of the Furies fighting force, and the characters of Big Barda, Aurelie, Mad Harriet, Lashina, Bernadeth and Stompa. It’s an untapped corner of Apokoliptin myth, with a whip-smart layer of contemporary commentary.Following work on The Flintstones, Snagglepuss, and DC’s Nuclear Winter Special, writer Mark Russell is an “auto pull” in my comics rotation. Russell’s brand of satire and humanism resonates deeply, and although I have absolutely zero nostalgic connection to The Wonder Twins, the prospect of Russell on such an odd piece of DC history was instantly tantalizing.Stephen Byrne’s art is perfectly suited for this high school setting, and Wonder Twins manages to wrangle Super Friends nostalgia into an extremely relevant story for 2019.Ever since Captain America 3: Civil War hit theaters, I’ve said it’s a fool’s errand to question the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Pulling off a movie of that scale, with that many moving pieces proved to me once and for all that the creative players involved were a near lock on a quality offering (and that was before we saw the true scale in Infinity War).That’s also how I’ve come to feel about comics written by Tom Taylor. No matter how outlandish the premise (a videogame were Superman goes Tyrant-mode or a Wolverine series featuring a *gasps* real live girl!) Taylor delivers some of the best superhero comics available.DCeased pulls that trick off yet again, this time with a “Marvel Zombies” style exploration of the DC Universe. While I still wish this was an in continuity event (let Taylor get wild, you cowards!), the freedom to explore free from continuity opens a lot of storytelling doors.The thing about this comic is that Matt Fraction (Sex Criminals, Hawkeye) and Steve Lieber (Superior Foes of Spider-Man) are responsible, and every indication is that it *should*  be one for the ages. Even with a limited sample available, I can say I unequivocally love “Superman’s Pal, Jimmy Olsen.” It’s hilarious, and inventive, and explores way more of the DC Universe than I expected.Above all else, Jimmy Olsen is challenging, zigzagging between eras and plotlines with reckless abandon, leaving only your faith in a guiding hand to keep the story from unraveling. Fraction and Lieber seem intent on ensuring all twelve issues of the series are in your hands before any accurate assessment can be levied, which certainly has both pros and cons. As a result, I’ve softened mildly on my assumptions that this would be my favorite DC Comic of 2019, and now find it merely quite good, with the possibility that I’ll have a spot for the completed work here again in 2020!A Green Lantern comic by the creative team of Grant Morrison and Liam Sharp is one of those sure bets that I could feel comfortable including on a best-of list sight unseen.I’m pulling and reading issue every issue the moment they’re released, but I’m just saying, my confidence in Morrison and Sharp is that high.Since Morrison has a history with the DC Universe dating back to the late 80’s, The Green Lantern is also held to the standard of his past work, which increases the complexity of evaluation. Ultimately I know this take on Hal Jordan, space cop is compared to some of the greatest runs in DC history. The looming shadow of reports that this is Morrison’s final superhero comic (we’ll see) also offer some legacy gravitas to a series that stands out regardless.I’ve written extensively in a “Previously On” column why I love “The Wild Storm” by Warren Ellis and Jon Davis-Hunt. I’ll add here that 2019 has been especially exciting as it houses the conclusion of this 24 issue narrative, and that the slow-burn is paying off in tremendous ways. Ellis and Davis-Hunt have effectively ramped up to “The Authority” portion of the proceedings, which means reimagined Jenny Sparks, Midnighter and Apollo (among others).It’s a contemporary masterclass in updating a shared universe and Jon Davis-Hunt is doing some of the best work in superhero comics. Plus, you can read all 24 issues right now, and have a full sense of story completion!Gene Luen Yang is one of the surest creative bets in comics, and his all ages work with artist Gurihiru is an instant classic, both an homage to Superman’s deep history and much-needed socio-political reflection of the Superman myth’s place in 2019.The oversized three issue book has quickly become one of my most eagerly anticipated releases, and even with the final third yet to be released in 2020, there’s no doubt that Superman Smashes The Klan is a remarkable testament to how effective true all ages works from the Big 2 can be in the right creative hands.The world of Batman is an unsurprisingly crowded realm this year, with all sorts of creative powerhouses taking their turn at the caped crusader. In Batman, Tom King is unveiling his years in the making love-story, in “Detective Comics” writer Peter Tomasi is taking the iconic title in a new direction, in “Batman Who Laughs” Scott Snyder and Jock reunite for a Dark Nights Metal spinoff, and in “Batman Universe” Brian Michael Bendis and Nick Derington are giving the Walmart faithful gorgeous Bat-adventures.And that’s before we get to “Black Label,” which is apparently going to be nothing but a Batman U showcase!Above all, though, I’m most excited for Batman: Last Knight on Earth which reunites New 52 Batman and Dark Nights Metal creative combo Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo. Snyder and Capullo have described the oversized three issue collection as their Dark Knight Returns, and they’re not overselling the goods. “Last Knight on Earth” is a post-apocalyptic / Mad Max style narrative in which Bruce Wayne awakens in a surreal DC Universe gone wrong and sets to make things right.Rather than lean in to the grim situation, Snyder and Capullo have fun with the premise, giving Batman a Joker-head to carry around on his newfound, perhaps final quest. It’s a gorgeous looking comic with all the absolute comic book conceptual joy of Metal.If you only read one comic book series in the DC Universe in 2019, make it Batman: Last Knight on Earth!Filed Under: Featured Tagged With: best of 2019, DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Chris J says September 14, 2019 at 9:59 pmWell, overall I can’t fault your choices as they are ‘your preferences’. However, I have to say that DC has long since disenfranchised me from their fold, something I’ve been somewhat loathe to admit having been a fan of their characters since the 50s and 60s. And, having been a fan, a comics artist and storyteller, back issue dealer, comic book store manager, and even having worked as a sales manager for a small comics publisher in the past (Viz), my perspective is rooted in a breadth of perspectives and experience. It’s not better than yours, but also lends itself more, perhaps of a longer perspective.While I might still be attracted to some DC characters and ever so hopeful, there have been so many missteps in the past ten years (and this also by accounts includes Marvel as well) that I no longer really…care about the characters. I bear that excuse and decision. Do I blame DC? No, I guess they’re doing the best they can in an exceedingly difficult publishing environment, and I have little doubt that the corporate folks who engineered the move to LA and are no doubt more bottom-line concerned has put the fear of god (getting fired, not achieving better sales, etc.) into the existing administrative/editorial pool that the general consensus of publishing is now based as much on focus groups, appealing to the middle ground, and…let’s face it…playing to the masses rather than…whatever they SHOULD be doing. Obviously, they haven’t figured it out, they’re inan environment where the staff don’t know what to do, and whatever they choose, might bring them all to the exit door. I dunno. I wish them all luck, but I barely recognize any of these characters. Retcons run rampant, rebirths, re-issues, re-starts with #1, crisis this and crisis that, crossovers that literally strip the money out of feeble-minded fans who are addicted and afraid to  miss out…what a mess. Best of luck to them allYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *Comment * Name * Email * Website  \n",

      "Apocalypse Reading Order Best Tablet For Digital Comics  Is Marvel Unlimited Worth It? Copyright © 2022 · Metro Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log inThe 30 Best DC Comics of All-Time, RankedThough I was chomping at the bit to do a “Top 30 Marvel Comics” it turns out there was a great list to that effect in October. But there was no such list for the “Distinguished Competition” on the site, so here we go: these are my top 30 favorite DC comics.As a note, these will include both regular DC superhero comics like Wonder Woman and Green Lantern, as well as several entries from their storied Vertigo imprint. When it gets down to the top ten, don’t be surprised to see significant overlap with our recent “50 Best Graphic Novels of All Time” list.Starting out with one of those imprints, DMZ both feels timeless in its depiction of a divided America and like a narrative and artistic time capsule from the Post-9/11 era of dystopian comics. The story follows a journalist trapped in Manhattan, now the eponymous DMZ between American factions, where the war-torn stories dominating the early 2000s news cycles take on a distinctly American flavor.It would be reductive but not inaccurate to call Longbow Hunters the Dark Knight Returns or Batman: Year One for Green Arrow. It’s a grittier depiction of the character, but with a painterly style that helps distinguish it from others in that genre. It’s stylish and is a solid introduction to those looking to get more into the psyche of Oliver Queen.George Perez’s defining run on Wonder Woman helped cement many of the qualities that are readily identified with the hero today. Gods and Mortals thrusts Wonder Woman into the midst of the drama of the gods and puts her role as a Daughter of Themyscira at the forefront of her journey into the modern world. New Frontier is Darwyn Cooke’s love letter to the Gold and Silver ages of comics, telling a story that interweaves the fictional evolution of the characters post WW2 with the real-world crises from McCarthyism to Jim Crow. It manages to both tell a story about a civil conflict within superheroes between the state-sanctioned ones and vigilantes working in the shadows while managing to never get too bogged down in grittiness and showcasing the best of these characters.Tom King’s run on Batman is good, don’t get me wrong, but it’s his Mister Miracle that’s special. In a lot of ways, Mister Miracle feels like a follow-up to his equally personal and similarly color-scheme’d vision series. Here, New Gods hero Mister Miracle is struggling with his past traumas and his domestic life with his wife and fellow New Gods refugee Big Barda. Like with Vision, Tom King knows how to effectively funnel cosmic sci-fi into a personal family narrative.Scott Snyder is a master of gothic horror, and the Court of Owls villain introduced at the start of his New 52 run may be one of the more iconic entries to Batman’s rogue’s gallery in recent years. Here, a shadowy cabal of masked elites threatens one area Bruce always felt was his strength: his knowledge and understanding of Gotham City. How the mystery unfolds leaves a little to be desired, but all-in-all it’s a compelling Bruce Wayne story that introduces an instant-classic villain.Aquaman’s reputation as a joke hero has always been somewhat undeserved, and nowhere is that status better struck down than in Geoff Johns’ New 52 reboot. Here, Aquaman’s adventures open up an undersea world of court intrigue worthy of Game of Thrones and elements of Lovecraftian horror in the depths of the sea. It’s an exciting, compelling homecoming for the rebooted Arthur Curry.This series doesn’t introduce John Constantine, that honor goes to a book later on this list, but it’s one of the stories that best illustrate the character by dragging him through some of his lowest moments. Here, the chain-smoking British exorcist faces his own mortality as he’s—understandably given the number of cigarettes he inhales—diagnosed with lung cancer. In this Garth Ennis story, Constantine’s life opens up more and readers get to know the man more even as his end seems nigh. It also shows Constantine at his best: dancing around and double-dealing cosmic forces and forever staying just barely one step ahead.In one of the best single-issue stories, a villain traps Superman in an artificial construct by giving him what he’s always dreamed of: a chance to experience life on his homeworld. It’s an interesting conceit that feels like a precursor to the later Elseworlds brand, and culminates with Superman having to give a heartbreaking farewell to a vision of everything he wanted. In just one issue, Alan Moore gets at the heart of the character in a way that few others accomplish.While Year One’s portrayal of Batman and Jim Gordon’s relationship is rightly praised, one of the best aspects of the comic is the repositioning of Batman as “the guy who beats up street-level crooks” -- though don’t get me wrong, there’s plenty of that -- to a vigilante willing to take on the wealthy and powerful that others won’t touch. It’s one thing when those are cartoonish businessmen like The Penguin, but Batman: Year One sends its hero after police commissioners and mayors, and gives new nuance to the character’s frequent clashes with authority figures throughout his mythos.The Sinestro Corps War is epic. It marks one of the best occasions where the writers get to let loose and fully embrace the space opera side of the character. Green Lantern Hal Jordan goes toe-to-toe with former comrade turned nemesis Sinestro in an epic battle across the stars. The central conflict is great, but the splintering of the emotional spectrum into multiple Lantern corps was one of the best changes to the character’s mythology in years and helped give the event a lasting weight.The “twist” in Under the Hood is set up in the Hush storyline, but it’s how the mystery unfolds in Under the Hood that’s got the real staying power. A specter of Batman’s past comes back to haunt him and is picking off Gotham’s villains one by one. Like with Court of Owls, Under the Hood also introduces a villain into Batman’s rogues' gallery that became an instant classic. There’s a fair amount made in Batman media about his non-fatal code, but it’s a conflict explored at its best here.This Superman spin on the nature vs nurture debate looks at how the Man of Steel might have been a different hero with just a slight change in the trajectory of the Krypton escape vessel. Here, Superman grows up in Stalin’s Soviet Union, a fact that changes not just his life but ripples out into other heroes and villains across the DC universe. The 1950s Elseworlds versions of the various characters are all fun and interesting, but it’s the character study of Superman’s values that helps make the book so memorable.There’s a lot of good Teen Titans stories, but The Judas Contract is the best and most memorable of Marv Wolfman and George Pérez’s storied run. The Teen Titans are a close-knit team that’s torn apart when a new member is revealed to be a traitor. It was a popular book, but The Judas Contract really put the Teen Titans on the map.It’s not uncommon for characters to get rebooted or reset in one way or another, especially at D.C., but it’s a rare pleasure to watch that happen on the page. In Dennis O'Neil’s run on the question, his own struggles with addiction play out in the noir-infused character. The eponymous hero is beaten nearly to death at the end of the first issue, and much of the rest of the first volume is the character slowly building himself back up from the ground but also questioning what it means to be an investigative hero and some hard questions about the use of violence to that end.Note: sadly the only accessible version of this, at the time of writing, is as single issues on ComixologyPut the ill-fated recent TV show out of your mind, Y: The Last Man is an incredible (and complete) journey following the last man alive on the planet as the world struggles with all the Y-chromosome folks suddenly dropping dead. It’s an interesting premise with a very new order to the world, and as he’d later do with Saga, writer Brian K. Vaughan excels in exploring through that space with a small and very believable cast of characters.Fables, the story of the interwoven lives of various fairy tale denizens living in a magical borough of New York, loses some steam as it goes on. But if it’s a story with some lows, it’s certainly worth reading for its highs. When writer Bill Willingham leans in on the noir or fantasy epic sides of the story, particularly with sections following grizzled sheriff Bigby Wolf, it’s a thrilling ride.The New 52 relaunch had some misses for DC, but where it hit (like Court of Owls and Aquaman) it did so in a big way, and one of those who benefitted the most was Amazonian Diana Prince. Updating and truly living up to the mythological groundwork laid in Gods and Mortals, the New 52 reboot for Wonder Woman adds new wrinkles into her origin and modernizes the Greek pantheon into a compelling urban fantasy series that’s an easy recommendation for any fans of mythology, comics or otherwise.One of the most fun aspects of American Vampire is how willing writer Scott Snyder is to throw out the traditional vampire lore. With various “strains” of vampirism, Snyder throws out the old rules about sunlight and silver in favor of new, wholly American takes on the myth. It’s a decade-hopping tale that starts with a young woman in the Golden Age of Hollywood abused and left for dead, but the story expands over time into a story of grudges and obsessions that span human lifetimes.Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale’s The Long Halloween is widely beloved, but spoiler alert: you won’t find it on this list. For my money, the pair’s best work at DC Comics was Superman for All Seasons. It’s fairly simple as far as Superman stories go, but its strength is in tapping into the minds of the supporting cast closest to Clark Kent. Each of the stories offers a beautiful and well-written perspective on the hero with a masterful, Norman Rockwell-esque visual style that’s Tim Sale at his best. There’s rarely been a more heartfelt encapsulation of the Man of Steel, though there’s at least one better Superman story later on in this list.This won’t be Alan Moore’s last entry in the Top 10, and anyone who has read a “Best of DC” list will understand why. But before… that elephant in the room, Alan Moore breathed new life into the superhero horror character Swamp Thing. The whole run is great, but the first volume’s Ship of Theseus reinvention of the character is a bold and defining turn.The recent love of embracing the silliness of Silver Age villains and humorous juxtaposition against over-the-top violence in media like the Harley Quinn show can, in some ways, be traced back to Gail Simone’s seminal Secret Six. It’s the story of a team of villains with some high body counts, but it’s impossible not to fall in love with the new takes on villains like Bane and Catman that help anchor this dysfunctional team. In arguably the best Batman comic of the last 20 years, Bruce Wayne is nowhere to be found. At a time when Bruce is missing in action, former Robin Dick Grayson steps up to the mantle. But Snyder makes the keen observation that if the villains of Bruce Wayne’s Batman are a reflection of his psyche, then Grayson’s rogue’s gallery would look very different. Black Mirror, impeccably illustrated by artists Jock and Francesco Francavilla, pits Grayson against villains that play with Batman as legacy and generational privilege.To understand what makes Kingdom Come so great, it’s important to have some awareness of what comics were like in the 90s. The anti-hero was all the rage, with the traditional heroes on the wane. Kingdom Come takes that on directly, with a story that poses the question of whether or not there’s still a place in modern comics for characters like Superman or Batman. In doing so, it tells one of the best Elseworlds stories and arguably the greatest Justice League story.Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series is set in some ways inside the D.C. universe, but make no mistake: this is very much a Neil Gaiman story. Preludes and Nocturnes is the launch of Gaiman’s series, but Season of Mists is where Gaiman’s ethereal mythology story truly starts to shine. When Lucifer abdicates his responsibilities in overseeing Hell, a power struggle ensues as various gods try to seize the reins.Grant Morrison’s Superman is possibly the best depiction of the character as Clark Kent faces his own mortality. Morrison whole-heartedly embraces the full history of the character and paints a compelling portrait of what makes Superman an enduring figure. It’s hard to imagine a book that manages to deliver a fitting send-off to a character that’s been around since 1938, but Morrison manages it.In what may be Grant Morrison’s best work, and possibly the best non-Batman story out of D.C., Animal Man is a mind-bending take on the then-neglected Silver Age hero not only breaks through the fourth wall but deconstructs it in many ways. Animal Man is a delightfully bizarre dive into life inside a world where world resets and real-world sales figures can mean life or death to living, breathing characters. However bizarre Morrison’s Animal Man gets, though, it’s steered through by Morrison’s full sincerity and compassion for his characters.If Morrison faced the unenviable task of writing a “last Superman story”, Miller’s task of crafting a “final” Batman story (ignore that there’s a pair of pretty terrible sequels) feels nearly impossible. Miller not only succeeds but helped to redefine the character in ways that cast a long shadow even today. The story follows an elderly Bruce Wayne who emerges from retirement for a few nights to don the cape and cowl one last time in a mission to restore order to Gotham city. As we said in the “Best Graphic Novels” rundown: In all honesty, how could it have been anything else? There are countless blogs devoted to how overrated the comics are, and they’re all wrong. Nearly every issue in Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ 12-issue deconstruction of the superhero genre is perfect and genius on some level — particularly The Watchmaker, in which we follow Doctor Manhattan’s non-linear perception of the world. Every issue, every panel, feels carefully crafted and composed.Watchmen’s central mystery, who killed The Comedian, is a compelling hook for a story that dives headfirst into Cold War anxieties and meaningful questions about hero worship. There are few stories that can live up to the kind of reputation Watchmen has earned, but it does.\n",
      "   \t\t\tRanking The Best DC Comic Characters   \t\tJustice League is coming out on Friday and with that, we have another movie list. Today I will be ranking the top DC comic-book characters of all-time. This list is based off of the history and impact on pop culture. I’m basing this list off because their haven’t been enough movies in the DCU to make up a top 10 list; like I did with the Marvel list I made 2 weeks ago. With that out of the way, here are the top DC characters of all-time.Honorable Mentions- Two-Face, Ra’s Al Ghul, Lois Lane, Braniac, Bane, and Green Arrow10 Commissioner Gordon- He’s not your typical hero but Commissioner James Gordon is the definition of a hero. As the commissioner of Gotham City, he and Batman help clean up the streets of crime. He’s also the father of Batgirl and is of the Dark Knight’s most important supporting characters.9 Lex Luthor- As Superman’s arch enemy, Lex Luthor is one of the most iconic villains in comic-book history. What makes Luthor so scary is that he has the ability to go toe-to-toe with Superman and he doesn’t have any powers. But it helps when you are the smartest man in the world. Sometimes, it truly is “mind over muscle”.8 Dick Grayson (Robin/Nightwing)- Along with Batman, he and Dick Grayson form one of the most famous dynamic duos in the history of pop culture. Known to many as the original Robin, Grayson has gone on an incredible journey. He’s gone from a kid full of wonder to the hardened badass hero known as Nightwing.7 Hal Jordan (Green Lantern)- He’s a galactic space cop and he’s a one of the original core members of the Justice League.  Originally a fighter pilot, Jordan was chosen by the power ring from the planet Oa to join the Green Lantern Corps. With the ring, Jordan becomes one of the most powerful characters in all of DC Comics.6 Barry Allen (The Flash)- While he’s not the original Flash (Wally West), Barry Allen is by far the most iconic. After getting hit with a bolt of lightning, Allen gains superhuman speed and even has the ability to time travel. Ezra Miller will be bringing Barry Allen to the big screen for the first time in Justice League.5 Selina Kyle (Catwoman)- Not only is Catwoman the sexiest characters in all of comics, she’s also one of the best. Selina Kyle is the definition of an anti-hero as she’s only goal in life is to get rich and look out for her own interests. She’s also had two incredible portrayals one the big screen; the first being Michelle Pfeiffer and the ladder being Anne Hathaway.4 The Joker- There are countless iconic villains in comic book history, but no one can truly compete with The Joker. I could go on for hours about what makes the Joker so scary but I get down to the nitty. First off, no one knowns who he is (not even Batman) and there’s no rhyme or reason why he does what he does. He just does horrendous things because he can. He’s a true psychopath and one of the greatest villains in the history of pop culture.3 Diana Prince (Wonder Woman)- As we move into the DC Trinity, we start with the Warrior. Wonder Woman is the princess of Themyscira and arguably the most iconic female character in all of pop culture. What makes Diana such an incredible character is her strength, both literally and figuratively. Not only does she poses God like strength and extremely skilled in sword fighting, Diana is a very forgiving and loving character. She sees the best in people and that’s what makes her great.2 Kal-El/Clark Kent (Superman)- As the 1st superhero ever created it’s safe to say a few of you have heard of Superman. Not only is he one of the most famous superheroes, he’s arguably the most powerful. I also love the duality of Superman as he comes from two different worlds and two different ideals. You have Kal-El; the all power godlike alien vs Clark Kent; the regular American kid from Kansas. Not only is he trying to be a symbol of hope for the world, but he himself is trying to find his place in it. Deep stuff.1 Bruce Wayne (Batman)- Was there really any doubt here? Not only is Batman the greatest DC character of all-time, he’s the greatest comic-book character ever created. Not only is he more feared man in the world, he’s the leader of the Justice League. Oh yea, the man doesn’t even have any powers! What I love so much about Batman is that he a normal dude who just wants to make the world a better place. Driven by the tragedy of the death of his parents, Batman will never stop and give up on Gotham City. He is vengeance, he is the night, he is the goddamn Batman.Written By: Steven Santoro (SVS_1993)I love sports and movies. Be on the lookout for articles about both.

Comic book fans on Reddit have shared their thoughts and compiled their lists on what they believe to be the publisher's best work over the last year, ranging from their mainline and alternate canon stories.While his live-action tenure on the then-DC Universe streaming platform was unfortunately cut short, comic book fans commonly regard him as one of DC's best monster characters. Redditor LordCosmagog chimes in saying \"For me, the best books of the last 12 months have been Justice League Dark & Swamp Thing,\" with the Guardian of the Green being one of JLD's prominent members historically.Ram V.'s The Swamp Thing limited series garnered consistently high praise across its 10-issue run in its introduction of the next Guardian of the Green and new compelling, emotional themes that the likes of Alan Moore revitalized the character with. The great reception of the series led DC to greenlight another six issues for another run.The recent trailer for The Batman has stirred even more fan excitement, making now a good time for fans to read Mattson Tomlin's Batman: The Imposter. Tomlin was brought on in 2019 to assist Reeves and Peter Craig in writing the movie, and the premise and quality of the series seem like a clear influence from his time on it.It's perhaps the most grounded the Dark Knight has been in comics, focusing on a gritty, street-level crime-noir story of someone impersonating Batman to ruin his young reputation. Redditor SequentialNation compiled a list including \"the various excellent creator-driven books from DC Black Label,\" with The Imposter among them. Its praise is further testament to DC Black Label publishing some of the best modern Batman comics.While still in the realm of DC Black Label, James Tynion IV's The Nice House on the Lake is an isolated horror series to change the pace. The writer came from a well-received tenure on Detective Comics and recently wrapped up his Batman run, with Tynion emphasizing that his best strengths come the bizarre and frightening.RELATED: 10 Best Comic Books Ever, According To RankerRedditor TerraObus responds to the aforementioned list saying that \"Most of my top 10 comics of the year are listed up here,\" and that \"The Nice House On The Lake is the best of the bunch.\" The series is six issues in with another half-dozen to go, and it's already enthralling readers with visually striking moments of terror and character drama.Another former Batman writer transitioned over to DC Black Label for something refreshing. Tom King's Batman may have had its ups and downs, but his subversive noir \"whodunit\"-style The Human Target has been a proven hit. Redditor boom-bam praises the series saying \"he’s playing with all the classic noir tropes but having them play out in the superhero world.\"The story prides itself on influence from the classic, pulpy detective-noir stories of the 20th century while simultaneously, as the same Redditor points out, subverting that genre's tropes \"by having it play out in these beautiful splashy neon colors and Smallwood’s kinda hopeful lovely optimistic drawings.\"Being DC Comics' best street-level superhero, Batman is a character prime for anthology-style crime-drama adventures as well as the typical long-form story arcs. The announcement of Urban Legends signaled a further emphasis on this storytelling style, bringing together various accomplished creators from the comic book industry to make their mark on the Caped Crusader's celebrated mythos.One of which includes Chip Zdarsky, the current writer of the ongoing and acclaimed Daredevil series for Marvel. Redditor FranklinRichardss agrees with DC's success saying \"I mean in a lot of genres and format. DC released awesome comics this year,\" citing Urban Legends in their list of the year's best works.DC Black Label has also introduced more Wonder Woman into the mix, giving the Princess of Themyscira more of the spotlight she deserves. This series continues the fan-favorite brand of the \"color\" series alongside the flagship Batman: Black & White.RELATED: 10 Best Teenage Superhero Characters, According To RankerThe previous Redditor gives it particular praise with the other color series saying \"I'm not even talking about color series they [have] done for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman.\" Like the other two members of The Trinity, Wonder Woman's Black & Gold series was well-received for gathering various creatives to celebrate the history of an iconic superhero in several anthology stories.The Infinite Frontier relaunch was also a major milestone for Superman. Superman's main comic book series has been the self-titled series and Action Comics, but this year marked a sort of relaunch for Superman with the subtitle Son of Kal-El. Fan-favorite writer Tom Taylor helmed the series as its writer, and it's been a great success so far.Redditor FranklinRichardss also highlights Son of Kal-El for being part of DC's \"multiple LGBT+ stories,\" as it revealed Jonathan Kent coming out as bisexual. Jon Kent getting a turn in the spotlight has been a long time coming since he and Damian Wayne have been favorites in the form of the Super-Sons for some time already. Taylor's series has been praised for its emotional, character-focused writing.The same Redditor also includes Nightwing in DC's corner of mainline successes over the past year, with Dick Grayson seeing a return to form in the current Tom Taylor run. Grayson will always be a widely beloved member of the Bat-family, in part for being the original second-half of the Dynamic Duo, but also being a likable, interesting, and charming character in his own right.Nightwing's current high praises largely go toward its grounded approach by making use of the \"soft-reboot\" formula that understands the fundamentals of what makes him such a lovable hero. At the same time, it's a great jumping-on point for those who are new or have been away for some time.Also in Wonder Woman's corner of the world, DC Black Label's Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons series only has had one issue published so far, yet is already turning many fans' heads. Redditor SequentialNation included the comic in their list when referring to the \"excellent creator-driven books from DC Black Label.\"RELATED: 10 DC Heroes That Are Darker Than Their VillainsThe Amazons so far is a sprawling odyssey of a story that packs a thoroughly engrossing plot, gods true to the original folklore, and visually-stunning artwork on every page thanks to writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Phil Jimenez. Issue #1 already sets a high bar, with more creatives set to lend their talents in subsequent issues.The earlier note on \"about color series they [have] done for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman\" also includes Superman: Red & Blue. Like the other color series, Red & Blue has been praised for its tasteful approach in bringing together writers and artists to pay tribute to one of DC Comics' greatest superheroes.The new comic book series makes great use of the anthology-style to tell stories highlighting the history of the character. The stories told throughout its 6-issue run are great for veteran fans looking for a celebration of Superman while also being friendly to newcomers who want to get to know the superhero icon.NEXT: 10 Best Animated Batman Movies, According To RankerGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he now resides in Houston. He is a fan of pretty much anything involving nerd culture. Video games, comics, movies, TV, anime, manga, you name it. He also has experience writing about soccer, specifically, the German team Bayern Munich.Best DC Comics Of 2018Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansJune 18, 2018 by Dave 6 Comments DC Comics has maintained their status as comic book retailer and critic’s favorite son throughout 2018. Now approximately two years since the launch of DC Universe: Rebirth #1, the publisher has been hitting a *majority* of the right notes (though far from all given the damn countless number of comics credits that still bear the dark mark of Eddie Berganza). Likewise, the publisher’s major 2018 event, DC Metal, was one of the best superhero crossovers of the decade, setting the stage for a compelling Justice League lineup through the end of the year.Recent moves suggest this PR glory boat may come to a fiery end by the time 2018 turns one. DC made the strange decision to raise prices nearly linewide to $3.99, while simultaneously removing digital codes from nearly all comics (“What we lack in talent, we make up for in ineptitude.”) Likewise, both DC’s “New Age of Heroes” and “Doomsday Clock” haven’t struck much of the desired cultural chord, and the publisher has absolutely *none* of the built-in movie hype that Marvel Comics *should* in theory reap the benefits of.Still, there’s a lot to find exciting about DC’s back half, including their “Black Label” lineup that will include the likes of Frank Miller and John Romita Jr producing “Superman: Year One.” Mix in writer Tom King’s promised 100 issues on Batman, Brian Michael Bendis’ rebirth on Superman, and the promise of a Lex Luthor/Porky Pig one-shot, and it’s easy to get wildly excited.Related Reading Orders:BatmanComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Late 2017 saw the title seemingly ascending to perfection with a run of “Batman Annual #2” and the “Superfriends” double date story arc in Batman #36 to #37. 2018 has seen writer Tom King and a rotating cast of fantastic artists including Joelle Jones, Clay Mann, and Tony Daniel, come back to earth – meaning this is simply *one* of the best DC Comics of the year, not the *absolute* best.Related Reading Orders:DC MetalOn “Best Comics Ever,” Comic Book Herald’s all-new podcast, I made DC Metal my first deep dive topic, and concluded it’s the second best superhero event of the decade (just behind Marvel’s 2015 Secret Wars). Events and crossovers are *rarely* this engaging, and almost never this cohesive, yet New 52 Batman team Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo (with plenty of help from their friends) deliver a cosmic Justice League epic worthy of the “Crisis” adjacent status.Related Reading Orders:DeathstrokeQuickly escalated from “interesting” to “must-read” status in year one, and shows no signs of slowing during the collective comics Christopher Priest appreciation resurgence.Related Reading Orders:Justice LeagueThe biggest downside to Christopher Priest’s time writing Justice League is that it only lasted 10 issues before the big linewide shakeup.Related Reading Orders: SupermanThere’s been so much hype about longtime Marvel writer Brian Michael Bendis’ move to DC’s Superman, that it’s easy to overlook what has been one of DC’s best comics since Rebirth began. Helmed primarily by Peter Tomasi and Patrick Gleason (with plenty of additional creators), Superman taps into the family dynamics of Lois, Clark, and their son Jon better than just about any comic has this decade.Related Reading Orders:SupermanDamian WayneLooking back, it makes perfect sense that Tomasi and Gleason, fresh off excellent work writing Damian Wayne for the New 52’s Batman and Robin, and actively telling new stories about Superson Jon Kent, would be able to create a delightful early adolescent team-up. Much their fathers, the sons of Batman and Superman play off each other’s persona’s for a great balance.Related Reading Orders:DC RebirthThere are higher profile Bat-books, and there are Bat-books with bigger stakes, but few pack the emotional, intimate punch of James Tynion IV’s time writing Detective Comics.Related Reading Orders: BatmanDespite all the trappings of an overexplored trope trussed up with clever design (what if the Joker was, like, good?), Batman: White Knight delivers a compelling limited series.Related Reading Orders:New GodsDC Rebirth Year TwoEvery issue of Mister Miracle, a twelve issue limited series by Tom King and Mitch Gerads, is a reminder that 1) It’s the best comic book being published and 2) The New Gods are flipping exploding with boundless potential. Truly, from innovative layouts, to structural mystery, to grin-inducing family humor, Mister Miracle isn’t just the best DC Comic, it’s just the best comic.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Dave says June 19, 2018 at 9:34 amMister Miracle definitely falls into that category of superhero comics that transcend the genre. I do wonder how much a familiarity with the New Gods matters.

      "Best Comics of 2022 (So Far): DC ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — On the heels of one of its strongest 12-month periods in many years, DC Comics has continued that momentum in 2022. In fact, today’s list of the Best Comics of 2022 — DC Comics has that good problem of there being too many excellent series worthy of inclusion. We, however, have done our best to break it down to eight uniformly excellent books that speak to the broader quality of the publisher’s line. You can find those selections below, and as we noted in the Best Comics of 2022 — Marvel Comics list, don’t forget to check this page every month for an updated ranking.Enjoy!1. Catwoman: Lonely CityWriter/Artist: Cliff ChiangWhy It’s Cool: There’s an irony in Catwoman: Lonely City being at the top of our Best Comics of 2022 - DC Comics list, because of this writing in late March, the series hasn’t released a new issue this year. But the next issue is coming? Catwoman: Lonely City #3 is due out April 19, and series editor Chris Conroy has said it’s the best issue yet. That’s saying a lot, a whole lot, given the Catwoman: Lonely City #1 was one of less than five single issue comics that I gave a perfect 10 score to last year. It was, without exaggeration, the best ﻿single issue experience I’ve had with a DC comic in a really long time. A singular and detailed vision from cartoonist Cliff Chiang, the book reads like a 2022 Dark Knight Returns, just focused on Catwoman. She’s older, piecing together a broken Gotham City where Batman has been dead for years. She’s mixing it up with new, diverse characters as well as aged Batman rogues who are still kicking around. And it’s all taking place in a Gotham that Chiang has said is heavily influenced by real world New York City, from its changing culture to its municipal politics. On top of all the visionary artwork and character-driven attention to detail, this series also has charm to spare. It’s a deeply heartfelt and at times funny book, one that entertains in unique and special ways on every page.Pre-Order The Hardcover: Catwoman - Lonely City HCRead The First Issue Digitally: Catwoman - Lonely City #12. The Nice House on the LakeWriter: James Tynion IVArtist: Álvaro Martínez BuenoMost Recent Trade: Nice House on the Lake, Vol. 1Why It’s Cool: The Nice House on the Lake #1 was one of the other five comics last year that I gave a perfect 10 out of 10 too. It really is a perfect debut issue, one that is imaginative, chilling, stylish, and as assured as a new comic gets. In the other six issues that have so far come out, ﻿the book has progressed and evolved, become perhaps one of the best pieces of pandemic fiction, a perfect horror/sci-fi reflection of how it feels to live through a chaotic world in relative comfort, guilty and powerless to some extent to do anything about what’s happening.The other quality that lands The Nice House on the Lake at our number two spot is the stunning artwork by Álvaro Martínez Bueno, colored to eerie perfection by Jordie Bellaire. This is a DC comic, published through the Black Label imprint, but there’s no predictable superhero visuals to this book. The work Bueno is doing here feels imaginative and wholly new, with surprises often coming after any page turn. It feels in the best way like Vertigo Comics at its height, just in terms of competency, smarts, and risk-taking. This book is another must-read.3. Action ComicsWriter: Phillip Kennedy JohnsonPrimary Artists: Daniel Sampere, Miguel Mendonca, and Riccardo FedericiMost Recent Trade: Superman - Action Comics, Vol. 1 - Warworld RisingWhy It’s Cool: I like this run so much that it inspired me to write a piece called It’s Time to Talk About Action Comics because it Whips Ass. And it absolutely does. It’s a story in which Superman gets lost in space with an updated, 2022 version of The Authority. Operating outside the nascent — and currently underpowered — United Planets’ perview, Superman has decided to take on the most-recent, very powerful Mongul and his warworld. What has ensued is a deep space gladiator epic (a bit like World War Hulk, but also not at all like World War Hulk), where Superman is working to liberate a full planet of oppressed people with his powers dampened. At the same time, members of his splintered team are working in the shadows to foment a revolution. Simply put, these are high-action, giant sci-fi concept, complex comics. They’re armed with fantastic, grandiose artists, a writer who is nailing every story beat, and a sense of momentum I haven’t felt from an individual Superman comic in many years. If you’re looking for an engaging more traditional superhero comic than the first two on this list, this is the one.Other Relevant Trades: Future State - Superman; Superman & The Authority; Superman - The One Who Fell; and Superman - Action Comics, Vol. 1 - Warworld Rising4. Human TargetWriter: Tom KingArtist: Greg SmallwoodMost Recent Trade: Human Target, Vol. 1Why It’s Cool: I am a sucker for any comic that takes tropes from other genres and affixes them to superhero characters. DC Comics has done this really well in recent years, with stories like DCeased, which is what if zombie apocalypse but with DC characters, as well as with Dark Knights of Steel, which is what if twisty political fantasy epic but with DC characters. Human Target, however, is my favorite of them all, and it’s what if old Hollywood noir but with DC characters, specifically the characters from the classic run of Justice League International. What makes this comic truly special is the pop-art sequential storytelling being done by Greg Smallwood, which has just been stunning. Combine that with Tom King’s clear common of punchy, old-time dialogue complete with over-the-top exaggerated hard-boiled characterization, and you get an excellent comic that reads unlike any other book from DC. There’s some grumbling out there about the relationship this comic has to the source material, but this is essentially an Elseworld story, where taking liberties with the characters is part of the point.5. One Star SquadronWriter: Mark RussellArtist: Steve LieberWhy It’s Cool: This is another book that sort of fits into what I was writing about above, the type of out-of-continuity superhero comics that use these well-known characters in the service of exploring other types of story. In this case, it’s superheroes meets Glengarry Glen Ross, and, if I’m being honest, the superheroes aren’t all that well-known. No, this is a book about the deepest of deep DC Universe bench characters, who are now working for a new app-based company where users can pay to rent hero’s time, doing so for everything from temporary security gigs to making appearances at children’s birthday parties.The real villain of this story is, of course, corporate greed, which turns even people who use extraordinary powers to combat evil into faceless pieces of a machine, susceptible at any time to the machinations of a few suited folks in a boardroom. Armed with writer Mark Russell’s signature satiric wit and the clever-but-heartfelt cartooning of Steve Lieber, One-Star Squadron rounds out the top five of our best comics of 2022 — DC Comics list.Read The First Issue: One-Star Squadron #1 Digital 6. Arkham City: The Order of the WorldWriter: Dan WattersArtist: DaniWhy It’s Cool: Like the majority of the in-continuity Batman comics right now, Arkham City - The Order of the World depicts an interesting corner of Gotham City that we don’t get to often see in the main title. It’s a story that features Azrael, some familiar old villains, and one absolutely chilling new villain that I hope we get to see again, sooner rather than later. This is perhaps the Batman comic right now that has the most experimental concepts, armed as it is as well with a chic almost-abstract indie comics aesthetic. Writer Dan Watters and artist Dani are a hell of a team — as see in the hit indie comic series, Coffin Bound — and it’s been a real treat to see them taking their talents to Gotham. This is a six-issue miniseries that recently concluded, with a trade collection presumably on the way at some point later this year.Read The First Issue: Arkham City - The Order of the World #1 Digital7. The Swamp ThingWriter: Ram V.Primary Artist: Mike PerkinsMost Recent Trade: The Swamp Thing, Vol. 1 — BecomingWhy It’s Cool: Excuse this absolutely awful bit of punning, but this new run of The Swamp Thing has made for fertile ground for some of the best superhero comics at DC. Very sorry about that, but it’s true. This is an updated take on the character, one that uses Mike Perkins gritty cartooning and Ram V’s knack for poetic scripting to give this series a poignant sensibility that feels apart from anything else coming from DC Comics. In that way, it’s a book I’d recommend to readers who are new to the character but have enjoyed Ram V’s work around mythology and colonialism in his indie breakout titles — These Savage Shores and The Many Deaths of Laila Star, chief among them — as well as to readers who enjoy a good story about Swamp Thing.Read The First Issue: The Swamp Thing #1 DigitalRead our full review of the first trade!8. Batman/Superman — World’s FinestWriter: Mark WaidArtist: Dan MoraWhy It’s Cool: The art on this book is absolutely beautiful, looking as bright and iconic as these characters can. Dan Mora, with colors by Tamra Bonvillain, is just doing absolutely stunning work. Making things even better, is that Mark Waid (Kingdom Come) is back at DC Comics, doing his first proper run on a title in I don’t know how long, and it feels like he’s been saving this story for years. It’s fast and clever and it seems determined to span some of the most fun corners of the DC Universe, from obscure Superman villians to steady cameo appearances by the Doom Patrol. This is perhaps the best book right now for fans of traditional DC superhero comics, and it’s just getting started.Read The First Issue: Batman/Superman — World’s Finest #1 DigitalRead our review of the first issue!9. Monkey PrinceWriter: Gene Luen Yang 楊謹倫Artist: Bernard Chang 張伯納Why It’s Cool: Writer Gene Luen Yang, teamed here with artist Bernard Chang, is doing perhaps his most personal work yet for DC Comics, having created a new superhero for the publisher that springs from the same mythology that informed/appeared in Yang’s breakout graphic novel, American Born Chinese, one of the true must-read comics of the past 20 years. This series is about a teen superhero coming to terms with a power set and a power source unlike anything we’ve really seen in Big 2 superhero comics. On top of that, Yang and Chang also infuse the entire story with a sense of fun and a hilarious, attitude-heavy sense of humor. There’s so much that makes this a fun, colorful read, a different kind of superhero comic that’s perfect for readers of all ages. Read The First Issue: Monkey Prince #1 DigitalRead our review of the first issue!10. The JokerWriter: James Tynion IVPrimary Artist: Guillem MarchMost Recent Trade: The Joker, Vol. 1 HardcoverWhy It’s Cool: A series about The Joker is not necessarily something I’d be into, and yet this still one of my favorite Batman-adjacent comics, landing it a spot on my Best Comics of 2022 DC Comics list. While The Joker obviously takes the title and the focus of the book’s marketing, this series is really about Commissioner Jim Gordon, who has quite a bit of history with the titular villain. This series grew directly from the biggest event to happen in the Batman comics in some time, wherein someone gassed the villains at Arkham Asylum, and the crime was blamed on The Joker. This book sees Jim Gordon on a globetrotting hunt for The Joker, financed by a shady group of wealthy Gothamies who are fed up with The Joker’s chaos and murder. The result is a complex and interesting character-driven series that makes the most of Batman continuity, past and present.Read The First Issue: The Joker #1 DigitalHonorable Mentions: Batman Killing Time, Batman — The Knight, Dark Knights of Steel, DC Vs. Vampires, Detective Comics, Nightwing, Robin, Task Force Z, and Wonder Woman.This section is dedicated to recent DC Comics trade collections and graphic novels newly available in 2022.

Along with the regular series starring well-known properties, DC put out some fun and exciting events and self-contained stories in their comics. While some titles were canceled for various reasons or cut short of their intended length, most, if not all, were high-quality products, both in writing and artwork.RELATED:  DC: 10 Characters That Made Their Comic Debut in 2020DC Comics put forth a diverse line of books for readers of all ages, different genres, along with options for new and established readers. As is always the case with such a wide range of comics, there were some that stood out from the others for many different reasons.Jimmy Palmiotti and Amanda Conner return to the antihero character of Harley Quinn, the character that they made their mark on and made popular with their five-year run. Released in conjunction with the motion picture of the same name, Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey miniseries finds Harley making her return to Gotham after her break-up with long time beau, The Joker, who is not taking her decision to end the relationship lightly.RELATED: 10 Things The Harley Quinn Animated Series Does Better Than Birds of PreyPublished under the Black Label imprint, this miniseries is a mature romp through Gotham as the Birds of Prey must protect Harley from the mass of bad guys out to collect her for The Joker. The series is a perfect bookend to Conner and Palmiotti's run on the character and a fun read with all the humor one would expect, making it the best book featuring Harley in 2020.The addition of the Hill House Comics imprint curated by Joe Hill, best known for previous works such as Locke and Key, brought the horror genre to the DC Comics. The first wave of miniseries' included titles such as Basket Full Of Heads, The Dollhouse Family, Daphne Byrne, and Plunge by some of the biggest names in horror.The title that stood out as one of the best was The Low, Low Woods, written by Carmen Maria Machado with art by Dani, following two teenagers who find themselves on a surreal and terrifying journey as they search for the truth about their strange hometown.Far Sector, the Young Animal imprint starring the Green Lantern Sojourner Mulleinv, and by Hugo Award-winning writer N.K. Jemisin with art by Jameson Jamal Campbell is a breath of fresh air and an exciting take on the Green Lantern concept. The maxiseries, set to wrap up at the beginning of 2021, takes the opposite approach of Grant Morrison's equally great The Green Lantern, setting itself apart by ignoring the usual superhero conventions associated with the character.RELATED: Green Lantern: 10 Stories To Re-Read Before The 80th Anniversary SpecialInstead, Far Sector focuses on the science fiction aspects and exploration of societal values one would expect if such things took place in the real world. One thing to note about this series that might be deemed as a negative is that it has a release schedule of every other month.This post-modern work covering his life from 1975 through 1995, beginning with his move to Suicide Slum to become a teacher and his vigilante life, retells classic moments from DCU history from the Black Lightning's perspective. If this first issue is what can be expected of the rest of the miniseries, readers are in for a new and fresh look at the DCU, guaranteed to become a classic \"must-read.\"In 2020, The Rebirth Era of the DCU wrapped up with one of the most anticipated series, Batman: Three Jokers, a thread that went back to the end of the New 52. Geoff Johns/Jason Fabok's ambitious story, though met with mixed reviews, still was a great read, providing readers closure while creating future avenues for the dynamic between Batman and The Joker to be exploredRELATED: Batman: 5 Questions Three Jokers Answered (& 5 It Left Hanging)Released at the same time as The Joker War event over in the main Bat-Family titles, Three Jokers is the perfect companion piece as it deals with the psychological impact the Joker has had, while Joker War takes a comprehensive perspective on the Joker's madness. In short, Three Jokers is a satisfying squeal to other classic Joker stories like The Killing Joke.Since starting the young reader graphic novels in 2019, the DC Ink line of offerings grew by leaps and bounds in 2020 without sacrificing quality for quantity. These graphic novels feature a stellar roster of bestselling writers and artists, offer self-contained stories featuring the company's iconic heroes, suited for audiences young and old.In 2020 the two books that stood out among the rest were Wonder Woman: Warbringer and You Brought Me the Ocean by Alex Sanchez and Julie Maroh starring Jackson Hyde. These graphic novels are great ways to introduce comics to young readers and focus on characters like Aqualad, who don't receive much page space in the regular DCU.A worldwide pandemic could stop Tom Taylor from continuing to bring out dead in three installments his DCeased story to life in 2020. The Hope At Worlds End chapter found the heroes in Metropolis dealing with the aftermath of the destruction during the original series, centering around Jimmy Olsen and how the heroes dealt with the onslaught of the Anti-Living.RELATED: DC: 5 Reasons DCeased Is The Best Zombie Apocalypse Arc (& 5 Why It's Dead Planet)Unkillables shifted the spotlight on to villains and anti-heroes such as Jason Todd and Deathstroke and explored how the villains faired after the heroes left Earth. The latest installment, Dead Earth, finds the new Trinity of Damian Wayne, Jon Kent, and Cassie Sandsmark, the Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman of Earth 2 traveling back to a dead planet after receiving a strange SOS beacon from Earth. Readers can only hope that there is more in store for this series.The Justice League Dark has been exploring and defending the DCU from magical threats in one form or another since its incarnation at the beginning of The New52. The latest team, led by Wonder Woman and a team comprised of team regulars Detective Chimp, Swamp Thing, and Zatanna, along with newcomers Dr. Fate and Man-Bat, and faced threats from the Dark Multiverse and beyond.This series, especially since Ram V took over as writing duties, has been once of the hidden gems of the DCU and hopefully will be a part of the new Infinite Frontier era.If one event that defined the DC Universe in 2020, it would be Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo's conclusion to their Dark Nights Saga in the pages of Dark Nights: Death Metal. Along with the main story told in a seven-issue limited series, there were plenty of one-shots that explored the many corners of the Metalverse, brought to life by the Dark Multiverse Batman Who Laughs.RELATED: Dark Nights: 10 Unanswered Questions From The Death Metal FinaleThis epic series not only introduced a ton of interesting characters but also set the stage for the next incarnation of the DC Universe, from the Future State event to the Infinite Frontier set to debut in March. The Dark Nights: Metal saga has been a fun, long strange trip, and it is sad to see it come to an end.Superman Smashes the Klan by Chinese-American writer Gene Luen Yang and artist Gurihiru is by far the best book that DC published in 2020. The three-issue limited series' main plot loosely adapts the 1946 story arc \"Clan of the Fiery Cross\" from The Adventures of Superman radio show. The story, set in 1946, follows the Lees, a Chinese-American family, who move from Chinatown to the suburbs of Metropolis following World War II and the subtle and overt racism they settle into the community.When the family is targeted and harassed by the Klan, Superman steps in but, in the process of helping, is forced to confront his self-doubt and self-identity as he is also an outsider. The backmatter, in which personal experience with racism as he grew up, enhances the comic and brings a much needed real-world aspect to things.NEXT: DC Comics: 10 Defining Events In 2020Chad is a lifelong comic book reader and collector who has many issues, most of which are bagged, boarded and stashed in a storage unit.

The fanbase has grown so strong that longtime fans are growing their collection of DC comic books and DC subscription box collectibles. They’re in pursuit of fastidious character plots, heroic leaders, chilling supervillains, and of course, justice. But which DC comic storylines have stood the test of time?  The fictional DC Universe has brought us the likes of Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, more contemporary imaginings of the salacious Suicide Squad, and the tenacious Teen Titans. But no matter who sits at the zenith of your most beloved plot, there’s no doubt DC Comics has brought fans some of the most electrifying storylines of steadfast champions, unswerving guardians, and resilient defenders.Join us as we explore the best DC comic storylines, including:Debuted in 1986, “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns” entrenches its readers in Batman’s decisive final scene. The four-issue comic book miniseries, which was written and illustrated by Frank Miller, commences with a now aged and reclusive Bruce Wayne. In this series, Batman has retired. It’s been ten years since the death of his second Robin, Jason Todd, who died at the hands of Gotham’s most notorious villain, The Joker. In a decision that confronts both his identity and call of duty, Batman is abruptly called back to the crime that still plagues Gotham City when a violent gang by the name “The Mutants” appears in the alley where Batman’s parents were murdered.After acquiring a new Robin—a girl by the name of Carrie Kelley—Batman moves into the future while continually confronting the past in the form of prior foes like Harvey Dent, The Joker, and even Superman. The miniseries is one of both internal reclamation and person redemption. Not only does Frank Miller explore the evolution of Batman, but of storytelling itself, interweaving the past and future into an action-packed storyline that has inspired readers for decades, creating a legacy with impact. The twelve-issue superhero comic series, written by Mark Wald and illustrated by Leinil Francis Yu and Gerry Alanguilan, is regarded as one of the best DC storylines for its modernized retelling of the caped crusader’s thrilling origin story. Initially created with the intention of introducing a non-canon saga, the storytelling was soon adopted as canon, replacing John Byrne’s “The Man of Steel.” Superman comics depicted the home planet of Clark Kent as a cold and heartless society. This series of Superman comics begins as the infant, Kal-El (Superman), is loaded into a pod and shot into space moments before the destruction of the planet Krypton. A loaded time-lapse then transports the reader to present-day West Africa, where we become witness to the violent conflict between two warring clans—of which Clark Kent, a burgeoning reporter, is covering. Kent quickly adopts the role of protector, shielding a human rights activist from an assassination attempt while still maintaining some secrecy and keeping his superpowers unnoticed. Inevitably, the superhero is met by a disconcerting medley of death and betrayal, and he eventually heads home to Smallville, where he’s determined to learn more about his alien heritage. This sequence catapults the superhero into a world of framed disguises, criminal enterprises, and the lovely Lois Lane.It’s then that readers are introduced to Kent’s arrogant arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, the head of LexCorp. LexCorp serves as a front for Luthor’s lawless affairs. Among Luthor’s musings is Superman, who he’s convinced is not of earthly origin. With his reputation at stake, Superman attempts to uncover the past, only to be thrown into a vicious battle of alien invasions. When Luthor discovers Superman’s vulnerability, Kryptonite, the question becomes: Who will prevail?The Birthright rendition is acclaimed for its bold reimagining of one of the world’s most popular superheroes. The society of Krypton was remodeled to value the principles of hope and peace, represented by the letter “S,” which Superman later adopts as his emblem and personal motivator. Often compared to Namor, when it comes to Marvel vs. DC Comics, is Aquaman. Deemed one of the best Aquaman depictions of modern times, “Aquaman: The Trench” is the first story arc of Aquaman’s New 52 relaunch. New 52 is where DC Comics introduced the publication of 52 new series in 2011, each with revamped first issues. The story itself, which was written by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Ivan Reis, offers a chilling aquatic tale that may earn its own place in the DC Comics cinematic universe.Now battling a carnivorous race known as the Trench within the watery underworld, Aquaman fights to save Boston’s civilian population—the very faction that ridiculed his powers at the onset of the novel. Following a hunch that the aquatic race dragged civilian captives to their underwater lair, Aquaman enlists the help of Stephen Shin, the marine biologist who previously taught and betrayed the Protector of the Deep. When Aquaman finally descends into the watery depths of the Marianas Trench, he discovers the Trench’s elusive underground civilization, only to be confronted by an unlikely circumstance and an urgent moral imperative. The first installment of the New 52 dives deep into the identity of the New 52 Aquaman, solidifying his role as a protector—an identity that percolates through the storylines to come. Furthermore, the illustrations are especially vivid—conjuring up strange and usual images of sharp-toothed leviathans—and combined with unsettling storytelling components that leave the comic’s readers swimming in a watery nightmare.The graphic novel, written by Greg Rucka and illustrated by J.G. Jones, is a Greek tragedy.  After participating in an ancient ritual called The Hiketeia, Wonder Woman becomes eternally honor-bound to protect and care for a woman by the name of Danielle Wellys. When Wonder Woman discovers Danielle has killed the villains who murdered her sister, however, she finds herself entangled in a battle against Batman, who is looking for the young woman.Weary of her ability to break the oath without instigating the rage of the ritual’s vengeful keepers, the Erinyes, Wonder Woman is left to deliberate between breaking the sacred agreement or betraying justice. The story, which was released in 2002, was well-received by longstanding comic fans and critics alike and is often referred to as “the best Wonder Woman story” in all of DC Comics history.In this novel, Rucka himself chooses to explore how the Lady of Justice is perceived rather than delve into her mental psyche—a task he deemed “murderous.” This method pervaded into future installments, in which Wonder Woman’s reputation is continually examined and evolving. Specifically, Rucka is primarily praised for his sharp characterization of Wonder Woman as an actual person in place of an idealized caricature of womanhood, in which he portrays the superhero as a sincere, thoughtful, and even humorous sovereign.Greatly praised amongst the comic book community, Green Lantern’s installment of the Sinestro Corps War is a comic book crossover written by Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons. Its titian aesthetic is the work of illustrators Ivan Reis, Patrick Gleason, and Ethan Van Sciver.As the second part of a trilogy, the eleven-part Sinestro Corps saga begins at the threshold of an interstellar war fought between the Green Lanterns of Earth and the Sinestro Corps, an army led by Sinestro—a former Green Lantern who seeks to entrench the universe in fear. Armed with yellow power rings, the villains of the interstellar army initiate a full assault against the Green Lanterns, freeing both Superman-Prime and Cyborg Superman from imprisonment for their own biddings.When fellow Green Lantern Kyle Rayner is taken captive, his comrades attempt to free him from Sinestro clutches only to become entrapped themselves. In a thrilling, fast-paced narrative, the forces of good and evil oscillate between triumph and defeat until the interstellar battleground transitions to Earth’s terrestrial soil.When the team of Green Lanterns learns of an ancient prophecy, they are confronted by the reality of “The Blackest Night” and the birth of five more universal corps.After its introduction, the saga was commended widely for both its storyline and illustrations, achieving a nomination for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Penciler/Inker Team. The storyline itself provoked multiple reprintings, as well. Culturally, the storyline made waves, establishing its spot as a model for crossovers for stories to come. No matter who soars highest in your arsenal of heroes, CultureFly offers the world’s finest subscription boxes, collectibles, and attire for every type of DC fan.Like the heroes before you, you must traverse into the unknown.

Pioneering the art of comics for mature readers in the mid-80s, they let some of the greatest creators the medium has ever seen run wild, creating timeless stories set in the DC Universe and beyond.The timeless epics of DC Comics have served to bring comics to the mainstream, making them more than just stories about superheroes beating on each other. They've transcended their genre and are among the best comics of all time.RELATED: DC's First 11 Silver Age Comics (In Chronological Order)Updated on February 28, 2022: While the earliest issues of Detective Comics are largely criticized for problematic stories that used bad stereotypes of the time, the publisher grew after the introduction of characters like Batman and Superman, which kicked off the company's new direction. DC Comics has spent decades telling amazing and unforgettable stories that have changed the industry, so we've gathered some of the best DC comics that highlight how far the company has come since its beginnings in 1937.Prior to the reboot of Superman by John Byrne in The Man of Steel, Alan Moore and Julius Scwartz teamed up to tell the final story of the Silver Age Superman in 1986's Superman: Whatever Happened To The Man In Tomorrow. 10 years after the disappearance of the Man of Steel, a reporter investigates his final moments through an interview with Lois Lane that highlights the final battles with his rogues' gallery. The comic is an iconic send-off for DC's most popular character and has gone down in history as one of the greatest, even if it isn't exactly canon.Mike Grell was brought on to reboot Green Arrow in 1987 with The Longboy Hunters. This was because the character had continued to decrease in popularity over the years. Green Arrow abandoned the trick arrows he'd used for decades and adopted a more street-level style of crime-fighting that defined the character for decades.The Longboy Hunters reunited Green Arrow and Black Canary as he moved to Seattle. There, his past came back to haunt him. The three-issue series is a gritty and violent reboot of the character that shocked and impressed viewers.One of the most well-known storylines from the fan-favorite Legion of Super-Heroes is \"The Great Darkness Saga\" by Paul Levitz and Kieth Giffen, which featured nearly every member of the team that had appeared over their long history in the DC Universe. A villain known as the Master begins gathering powerful artifacts and draining energy from the Legion's deadliest villains.RELATED: 10 Members of the Justice League That Would Be Better In The Legion of Super-HeroesHe also builds a powerful Daxamite army with his goal to take over the universe. The storyline brought the past and the future of the DC Universe together as the Master was revealed to be Darkseid of the New Gods, resulting in one of the Legion's biggest and most memorable battles.Mark Waid and Alex Ross explored a possible future of the DC universe in 1996's Kingdom Come, which followed a disillusioned minister as he was joined by The Spectre to bear witness to a battle between the older generation of heroes and the next generation that threatened the world.Kingdom Come took place after the heroes of the Justice League had largely retired, while their children spent their days fighting against each other for fun or turf that endangered humanity. The classic heroes are forced to return, though the extreme decisions made by each side further split them apart and threaten to bring an end to the world in one of DC's greatest stories.Alan Moore and Brian Bolland gave fans the definitive origin of The Joker in 1988's Batman: The Killing Joke, although the graphic novel wasn't considered canon when it was first released. The Killing Joke featured dynamic art and in-depth exploration of the twisted relationship between Batman and Joker.The graphic novel is also known for its deep dive into the madness of The Joker as he takes his vengeance against Commissioner Gordon by shooting, paralyzing, and abusing his daughter Barbara Gordon in one of DC's darkest moments. The ending of The Killing Joke is also one that's sure to stick with fans, making it one of the best DC graphic novels.Putting Watchmen on this list is a no-brainer. Widely considered the greatest comic of all time, writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons's 1985-1986 classic brought the superhero comic kicking and screaming into the mainstream. Moore pulled out all the stops for this one and Gibbons's detailed and gritty art brought the whole thing to life.RELATED: Watchmen: Each Character's Charlton Comics Inspiration, ExplainedWith its in-depth look at the psychology of those who put on costumes, its twist ending, and so much more, Watchmen set the tone for future of comics. It's almost a cliche at this point to call it the greatest of all time.Batman is one of the most popular characters in the comics medium and The Dark Knight Returns, by writer/artist Frank Miller, is among the Caped Crusader's greatest stories. Along with Watchmen and Art Spiegelman's Maus, The Dark Knight Returns is credited with revolutionizing the comics medium. Starring an older Batman coming out of retirement to clean up Gotham City, it brought Batman into modern times.For years, he was looked at by the public as the campy '60s TV version; however, TDKR changed all that. It was the first of Miller's one-two Batman punch, followed by Batman: Year One, and still one of his best works.Crisis On Infinite Earths wasn't the first big event book in comics - that distinction goes to Marvel's Contest Of Champions - but it changed the way readers looked at event stories and set the stage for what was to come. Writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Perez's timeless classic is still one of the best event books of them all almost forty years later.What makes it so important (and unlike any crossover before it) is the massive and lasting change it brought. It changed the DC Universe forever, both streamlining it and opening it up to new fans. On top of that, it killed off two of DC's biggest characters – Supergirl and Barry Allen – and put a bow on the Silver Age concepts that had driven DC for decades. An amazing superhero story, it holds up all these years later.Infinite Crisis, by writer Geoff Johns and artists Phil Jimenez, George Perez, Ivan Reis, and Jerry Ordway, is the sequel to Crisis On Infinite Earths. It's easily the greatest event book of the twenty-first century. Building on the events of its successor, it pits the heroes of the DC Universe against an unforeseen threat that wants to rewrite reality.RELATED: 10 DC Characters Who Could Destroy The Universe If They Wanted ToInfinite Crisis has it all: great superhero action, a respect for the history of the DC Universe, and a tale about the importance of heroism in dark times. Much like CoIE, it's had lasting repercussions. It's served to show that even in the dark, gritty modern comic industry, a little hope can go a long way.Alan Moore's work at DC is among some of the greatest of all time, and his time on Swamp Thing is what really brought him into the public consciousness. That all started with Saga Of The Swamp Thing #21 where he, joined by artist Steve Bissette, changed everything everyone thought they knew about Swamp Thing.This issue started a revolution and changed horror comics forever. Gone were the hokey monster comics of yesteryear, replaced by something more intelligent and stylish. This one comic laid the groundwork for DC's British Invasion, and their Vertigo imprint is still one of the most well-regarded comics to star Swamp Thing.Writer Grant Morrison and artist Chaz Truog's Animal Man #1-4 was a successful re-imagining of the Silver Age superhero, but it was still just a run of the mill superhero book with some flourishes of Moore (like every other DC book by a writer from the UK at the time). However, the fifth issue, \"The Coyote Gospel,\" changed all of that by playing into the larger narrative Morrison would bring to the series.Featuring Animal Man hunting a mysterious monster in the desert, it's much more than it seems and plays into the meta-fictional narrative that would come to define Morrison's run on the book. A truly groundbreaking comic, it showed just how special a talent Morrison could be.DC is a company that completes a lot of firsts, including having the first superteam: the Justice Society of America. In fact, DC's roster of Golden Age heroes is pretty much unparalleled in all comics, and they took center stage in The Golden Age by writer James Robinson and artist Paul Smith. An Elseworlds tale set after WWII, it saw the heroes trying to get back to normal after the war and the dawn of a new threat.RELATED: Grant Morrison's 10 Best DC Stories, RankedRobinson and Smith were just about able to fit every Golden Age DC hero into this four-issue masterpiece, and it's a great primer for people who want to learn about some lesser-known (but no less great) DC heroes.DC's Vertigo imprint was a treasure trove of amazing creator-owned stories, and it doesn't get much better than Grant Morrison's The Invisibles. This mind-bending postcard from the '90s is a travelogue through sex, drugs, violence, conspiracies, and everything under the sun.The story, spread out over three volumes and seven story arcs, tells the tale of the Invisibles – a group of freedom fighters battling against the tyranny of the Outer Church, extra-dimensional aliens who control everything. Morrison and the numerous artists they worked with let their imaginations run wild on this one. It's full of amazing characters, breathtaking action and adventure, straight-up weirdness, and more heart than one expects.Neil Gaiman's The Sandman was one of the most popular - and best written - books of its time, and it still holds up all these years later. The story of his Darkness Dream of the Endless and his family, The Sandman brought high literature to comics in a way it never had before.The Sandman is the kind of comic that can be given to someone who isn't a comic fan, and they'll love it. It showed the world just how great a writer Gaiman could be. Few stories before or since have reached the same heights of characterization and plot. And as a result, it remains a classic of the medium that is one of a kind.Superman is the first costumed superhero in comics history, and his greatest tale is All-Star Superman by writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely. It begins, strangely enough, with Lex Luthor's ultimate victory. Foiling one of Luthor's schemes, Superman gets an overdose of solar radiation – one that will supercharge his cells but kill him.Morrison combines Silver Age concepts with his incomparable imagination and, combined with Quitely's amazing pencils, creates a Superman story for the ages. It hits all the right spots and shows why Superman is one of humanity's greatest fictional characters.NEXT: 10 DC Comics That Are Way Darker Than The DCEUDavid Harth has been reading comics for close to 30 years.

Follow him on Twitter- https://www.twitter.com/harth_david.THE BEST DC COMICS OF 2016Dec 21, 2016I read a lot of comics this year. Some were good, some were bad. I’ve broken down everything I enjoyed into a couple of sections. These are the Top Five DC Comics series that came out in 2016 (in no order). Enjoy!Be sure to check out the other 2016 lists as well.THE OMEGA MENBetween The Vision, Sheriff of Babylon and The Omega Men, 2016 is the year of Tom King. White Lantern Kyle Rayner enters the Vega System in an attempt to broker peace with the warring planets, only to be captured by a terrorist cell known as the Omega Men. Or are they rebels attempting to overthrow the fascist rulers of the system who are responsible for genocide? In 12 issues, King manages to tackle issues of terrorism, fascism, religion, martyrdom, and morality without it ever feeling over-stuffed or under-developed. He forces Rayner and the reader to face a hard question: what are you willing to do for a better tomorrow ­– and can you live with yourself after doing it? This is one of the most complex comics to come out of DC over recent years. You’d be doing yourself a disservice to miss it.THE FLINTSTONES It’s 2016 and one of the best books DC Comics is putting out is The Flintstones. Crazy, right? The Flintstones was published alongside Scooby Doo and Wacky Races, two books that are also modern takes of older properties. Only difference is The Flinstones isn’t an obnoxiously try-hard “adult” reimagining (Wacky Races is a bizarre Mad Max riff, while Scooby Doo is set during the apocalypse). Mark Russell writes some really smart satire, using the prehistoric setting to take on modern day politics, consumerism and religion. That premise might sound trite, but Russell makes it work; he actually makes The Flintstones a relevant property in 2016. We now live in a world where Fred Flintstone is a character with depth, while Wilma and Pebbles are actual three-dimensional characters instead of “Hot Red-Headed Wife” and “Child.”SUPERMAN: AMERICAN ALIEN When writer Max Landis announced the American Alien, he described it as being “the anti-All Star Superman”, which is something I think it achieves. All Star is all about why Superman is so great, while American Alien wants to show us Kent’s journey to that greatness. Landis gets Superman, which is something a lot of writers struggle to do. He’s a character whose most interesting stories come from moral quandaries and exploring his humanity, and by showing Clark age issue to issue we get to see how his understanding of right and wrong mature. Each issue is drawn by a different artist, which helps to emphasis the mood of each stage of Clark’s life. Nick Dragotta’s bright-eyed, round faces populate Kent’s childhood, while Tommy Lee Edwards grungy style depicts a teenage Clark discovering that his powers can be both a gift and a curse, and Francis Manapul’s bright, water-coloured artwork in issue #6 shows Clark discovering himself as Superman. This is a solid reimaging of Superman’s origin.MIDNIGHTERSteve Orlando and ACO’s Midnighter was a late entry in DC’s New 52 line-up, but it is easily one of the best titles to come out as part of the brand. If you don’t know who Midnighter is, he was created as a parody of Batman, who’s gay and more Batman than Batman. He also has a computer in his brain that allows him to be ten-steps ahead. ACO (and a team of fill-in artists) drew some of the best fight scenes I’ve ever seen in a superhero book recently. Every moment flows perfectly, and you can feel the weight behind every blow. Orlando manages to balance the skull-crushing fights with genuine romance, which is great considering how few LGBQT characters appear in mainstream comics –­ let alone headlining a book. If you want to read a superhero comic running on all cylinders, you need to read this.DOOM PATROL Gerard Way’s previous series Umbrella Academy was one-big love letter homage to Grant Morrison’s Doom Patrol run, so having him write Doom Patrol is a no-brainer. Way, along with artist Nick Derington and colourist Tamra Bonvillian, have brought back a few classic DP members, like Robotman, Negative Man and Niles Caulder, and introduced new characters such as EMT driver Casey Brinkle and singing telegram Terry None. Together, they’re going up against an evil conglomerate that plans on commercialising Danny The Street, who is a sentient street. There’s also a micro-universe inside a gyro. I don’t fully understand where Way and Derington are going with Doom Patrol, but I can’t wait to find out. It’s a weird and imaginative comic­ — which is something DC has been lacking for awhile.ALL-STAR BATMANI really enjoyed Scott Snyder’s Batman run, although I think it lost some steam after issue #50. All-Star Batman might just be the Batman thing that Snyder has ever written — better than “Black Mirror,” even. John Romita Jr. is drawing some of the best art of his career here. It looks and feels like his early nineties Daredevil work. I find it hard to describe Batman comics as feeling “fresh” because he, more than any other character, always kind of languishes within the same plot beats. But All-Star doesn’t feel like a Batman story I’ve already read before, and I’m all for that. This first arc has Batman transporting Two-Face 500 miles from Gotham, while perused by literally every Batman villain.BATMAN (REBIRTH)The first arc of King’s Batman really didn’t do it for me. Compared to the rest of his output this year, it felt really lacklustre, like it was just another superhero book. I want to chalk most of that up to David Finch because I cannot stand his artwork. But this second arc has been fantastic and hitting the emotional complexities that I expect from King.SHADE, THE CHANGING GIRLOn planet Meta, alien-bird-thing Loma puts on the madness coat of Rac Shade and has her consciousness transported into the comatose body of Megan Boyer. It’s a high-school drama in which the lead character can physically manifest madness. After Doom Patrol, this is easily the second best book being put out under the Young Animals brand. Cecil Castellucci’s story is a bit of a slow burner, but like Doom Patrol you can tell that he’s building to something good. At the very least, you need to check it out for Marley Zarcone’s fantastic artwork. Her page layouts are incredible.WONDER WOMENThere were so many Wonder Woman comics that came out this year, and they were all great (Except Wonder Woman: Earth One, but I’ll get to that later). Jill Thompson’s The True Amazon is the best reimagining of Diana’s origin story. Renae De Liz’s The Legend of Wonder Woman would be a close second. Greg Rucka’s current Rebirth run is a solid return to the character, with Nicola Scott turning out some of the best art of her career (although they both need to get back on track with Black Magick).Pop culture writing that’s good for your health.

Of course, there have been missteps along the way — but anything that's around for 90 years isn't going to come out unscathed. If you're lucky, there are way more hits than misses — and by that standard, DC has been very lucky indeed. Here's a look back at some of the greats that DC has given us over the years. First appearance: Detective Comics #233 (1956); rebooted in 52 Week #7, released June 21, 2006Created by: Kathy Kane (1956): Edmond Hamilton and Sheldon Moldoff; Kate Kane (2006): Geoff Johns, Grant Morrison, Greg Rucka, Mark Waid, Keith GiffenWhy we love them: In 1956, National Comics — DC's predecessor — decided that Batman needed a love interest to prove that he wasn't in a gay relationship with Robin. The Kathy Kane incarnation of Batwoman was plenty badass despite having been created primarily as a love interest — but she was eventually killed off in 1979. In 2006, Batwoman was reborn as part of DC's 52 series — this time, as complete certified badass Kate Kane, who is also an out and proud lesbian. During the December 2018 Arrowverse crossover event \"Elseworlds,\" Batwoman made her small-screen debut, played by Ruby Rose.First appearance: All-American Comics #16 (July 1940)Created by: Bill Finger and Martin NodellWhy we love them: There have been a few Green Lanterns over the years — Hal Jordan is probably the best known, but there's also Guy Gardner, John Stewart (who was one of the first Black superheroes to grace comics in general), and Kyle Rayner, as well. Rings filled with the green energy of willpower and created by the Guardians of the Universe are worn by all members of the Green Lantern Corps — and anyone or anything can be a Green Lantern if they have a ring. So far, Green Lantern had his own live-action major motion picture debut in a film of the same name that starred Ryan Reynolds as the Hal Jordan incarnation. Reynolds himself pointedly mocked that role later on as \"Deadpool,\" so you're probably better off reading the comics.First appearance: Al Pratt version: All-American Comics #19 (October 1940); Ray Palmer sub-atomic version: Showcase #34  (October 1961)Created by: Bill O'Connor and Ben Flinton; revamped sub-atomically by Gil Kane and Gardner FoxWhy we love them:  In the comics, after Ray Palmer disappeared, Palmer protege Ryan Choi stepped up to become the Atom thanks to creators Gail Simone and Grant Morrison in the DCU \"Brave New World\" series.Currently, the Ray Palmer version of the Atom is played by Brandon Routh in the Arrowverse CW show \"Legends of Tomorrow\" after he was introduced on \"The Flash.\" Routh also played Superman on the big screen in \"Superman Returns\" — which is a fairly unique situation. Routh told ABC News,\"I often get asked what's better to play, Superman or The Atom,\" he said. \"Superman was like the pinnacle of all superheroes and the movie that made my career, so you can't really compare, necessarily, but they are all fun.\"First appearance: More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940)Created by: Gardner Fox and Howard ShermanWhy we love them: Over time, the mystical object known as the Helmet of Nabu conferred virtually unlimited magical powers upon its wearer — in part because it was also possessed by the spirit of the ancient being known as Nabu. Teleportation, precognition — you name it, he can probably do it.The helmet originally bonded with Kent Nelson, whose father Sven had initially discovered the tomb of Nabu. There have been other Doctors Fate in the comics, but the Kent Nelson version was a recurring character on \"Smallville\" played by Brent Stait.First appearance: Black Lightning #1 (April 1977)Created by: Tony Isabella and Trevor Von EedenWhy we love them: The character of Black Lightning was DC's first African-American superhero to headline his own book — but initially, the company had some objectively terrible ideas about how they wanted to play it. The company originally intended to create the character as a white racist who magically transformed into a black superhero when he was stressed out. Tony Isabella — who had previously worked on the Luke Cage comic at Marvel and also created the character of Misty Knight — stepped in and created Jefferson Pierce instead. A mild-mannered and inspiring educator by day, badass crimefighter in his community by night — the character of Black Lightning is currently played by Cress Williams in the \"Black Lightning\" series on the CW.First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: Princess Koriand'r of Tamaran can't just fly — she can fly faster than light and survive the cold vastness of space with no external help. She's also able to use ultraviolet light as a weapon thanks to some sketchy experimentation that was done to her after her jealous sister betrayed her and forced her into slavery when she was young.Kory honed her skills, broke free, and headed to Earth to become Starfire — and she's currently played by Anna Diop on the DC Universe series \"Titans.\"First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: As the half-demon, half-human daughter of the interdimensional demon Trigon and human Angela Roth, Rachel Roth had to learn how to control her emotions from an early age — or risk destroying the universe. Luckily, she can channel those emotions into powers. Raven — Rachel — is currently played by Teagan Croft on DC Universe's \"Titans.\"First appearance: DC Comics Presents #26 (September 30, 1980)Created by: Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: As a human/technology hybrid who's able to interface with any and all technology with ease, Victor Stone — Cyborg — is clearly a guy you want on your team. Also, his cybernetic implants give him super strength, speed, and endurance.Cyborg has made three live-action appearances so far. In \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" and \"Justice League,\" he was portrayed by Ray Fisher. In the upcoming DC Universe series \"Doom Patrol,\" he'll be played by Joivan Wade.First appearance: More Fun Comics #73 (October 31, 1941)Created by: Mort Weisinger and Paul NorrisWhy we may eventually love them: As DC and Marvel continually kept one-upping each other's character ideas over time, some were bound to work immediately — and others weren't. Aquaman has had more screen time outside of DC properties than any other character on this list, all thanks to constantly being mocked in pop culture.The Jason Momoa incarnation of Aquaman has graced the big screen in \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Justice League,\" and his solo film debut \"Aquaman\" — and he's working hard to change our minds while still being a good sea life steward.Whether this love will last remains to be seen — but if there is anything movie and comics fans both love, it's a good redemption story.First appearance: Flash Comics #86 (August 1947)Created by: Robert Kanigher and Carmine InfantinoWhy we love them: Utilizing both her martial arts and detective skills, Black Canary isn't so different from Batman — minus the Wayne family fortune, of course. It's a combination of admirable and aspirational character traits that fans have been loving practically forever. Black Canary in live-action form has been played by Danuta Wesley in \"Legends of the Superheroes,\" Rachel Skarsten in \"Birds of Prey,\" Alaina Huffman in \"Smallville\" — and most recently, Katie Cassidy and Juliana Harkavy have played different incarnations of the character on \"Arrow.\"First appearance: The Saga of the Swamp Thing #25 (June 1984)Created by: Alan Moore, Stephen Bissette, and John TotlebenWhy we love them: Tapping into powers of the occult is otherworldly but not automatically considered a superpower in the way that, say, the powers of flight or superhuman strength might be. Also, did we mention that he's an infamous and blatant con artist? If anything, over time, Constantine has proven himself to be more of an antihero than anything — but that's why he's so appealing.The character has made live-action appearances played by Keanu Reeves in the movie \"Constantine\" and by Matt Ryan in the short-lived \"Constantine\" TV series, as well as \"Arrow.\" Ryan plays the character now on \"Legends of Tomorrow.\" First appearance: Doom Patrol #99 (November 1965)Created by: Arnold Drake and Bob BrownWhy we love them: Garfield Logan was a normal enough kid — until he developed a rare disease that almost killed him. Luckily, his parents were two brilliant scientists, and they tried a previously untested experimental treatment on young Garfield that both saved his life and turned him into Beast Boy. Maybe you wouldn't want that ability, and maybe you would — but it's definitely cool that someone with Garfield's personality has it.He's portrayed by Ryan Potter in the DC Universe series \"Titans.\"First appearance: Action Comics #252 (May 1959)Created by: Otto Binder and Al PlastinoWhy we love them: Superman is Superman in part because of his human family — but what if you were a Kryptonian and had all the powers that entails but didn't end up with adoptive parents like Clark's? You'd be a different person — you'd be Supergirl. Kara Zor-El — cousin to Kal-El — was adopted in the comics by the Danvers family. Eventually, she gave her life to save everyone else, including her cousin — and died in the book Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 (October 1985). In live-action form, Supergirl has been played by Helen Slater in the 1984 \"Supergirl\" movie, Laura Vandervoort on \"Smallville,\" and is currently played by Melissa Benoist on the CW's \"Supergirl\" series.First appearance: (as Robin) Detective Comics #38 (April 1940); (as Nightwing) Tales of the Teen Titans #44 (July 1984)Created by: Dick Grayson/Robin created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger; Nightwing created by Marv Wolfman and George PérezWhy we love them: Even the most casual fans of Batman know about Robin — and some might even know that there's been more than one person behind the mask over time. The first Robin was Dick Grayson, whom Bruce Wayne adopted as an orphan and trained to fulfill his role as Robin. Over time, Dick Grayson began to question what he was doing as Batman's sidekick — before eventually deciding that although he wanted to be a hero, he also wanted to do it his own way. He handed over his costume — and permission — to a new orphan named Jason Todd, who would go on to become the new Robin.Soon after, Dick Grayson reappeared as Nightwing. Although fans of DC animated offerings have seen Nightwing several times onscreen, it's likely we'll be getting at least one live-action representation of him soon. A Nightwing movie has been announced, although no details are available yet. It's possible that we'll see Nightwing sooner via DC Universe's \"Titans,\" which makes sense. The Dick Grayson/Robin there — played by Brenton Thwaites — is clearly transitioning away from his previous Robin role as Batman's sidekick. Jason Todd has also been introduced, so it's a distinct possibility.First appearance: Detective Comics #359 (January 1967)Created by: Gardner Fox and Carmine InfantinoWhy we love them: Much like Batwoman, Batgirl was introduced back in the day to make Batman and Robin's relationship seem less homoerotic. Unlike Batwoman, the character of Batgirl didn't fade away and disappear for 30 years — instead, she developed into an integral part of the team. In 1988, courtesy of Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's book \"The Killing Joke,\" the Joker shot Barbara Gordon through the spine and paralyzed her. Barbara Gordon adapted to her new circumstances and used her brilliant mind to become Oracle — evolving yet again. DC decided it wanted to have the Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl — not Bette Kane, Stephanie Brown, or Cassandra Cain, who had all also been Batgirl in the comics — back again for its New 52 relaunch in 2011. By then, Babs had been Oracle for 23 years.This was a controversial move at the time — as there simply aren't a whole lot of disabled superhero stories being told by anyone, let alone as well-respected a writer as Gail Simone. Live-action versions of Batgirl have been portrayed by Yvonne Craig on the Adam West-starring ‘60s \"Batman\" TV series and Alicia Silverstone in the movie \"Batman and Robin\" (though it's worth noting that although she was Batgirl, she was not Barbara Gordon — the movie created a character not seen elsewhere in DC lore called Barbara Wilson, a niece of Alfred Pennyworth). A live-action Batgirl movie is reportedly in development.First appearance: as Jay Garrick: Flash Comics #1 (January 1940); as Barry Allen: Showcase #4 (October 1956); as Wally West: The Flash #110 (January 1960); as Bart Allen: Flash Vol. 2 #92 (July 1994)Created by: Jay Garrick version: Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert; Barry Allen version: Robert Kanigher, John Broome, and Carmine Infantino; Wally West version: John Broome and Carmine Infantino ; Bart Allen version: Mark Waid and Mike WieringoWhy we love them: The Flash started with Jay Garrick, a college student who had a terrible laboratory accident that mysteriously gave him super-speed. When the hero known as the Flash was rebooted as police scientist Barry Allen in 1956, the idea of updating heroes for modern times was born — and comics literally have not been the same ever since. For example, the current Barry Allen as seen in the CW tv series \"The Flash\" is now a forensic scientist — a profession that didn't even exist when the character was first introduced in the comics. As you might imagine, the Flash has been portrayed in various live-action incarnations. In 1979, \"Legends of the Superheroes\" specials saw him played by Rod Haase; in the 1990 TV series \"The Flash,\" he was played by John Wesley Shipp; in \"Smallville,\" he was played by Kyle Gallner; in the Arrowverse shows, he's played by Grant Gustin and John Wesley Shipp, while Keiynan Lonsdale plays Kid Flash; in the DCEU movies, he's currently played by Ezra Miller. First appearance: More Fun Comics #73 (November 1941)Created by: Mort Weisinger and George PappWhy we love them: Who doesn't like a story about an obnoxious, spoiled rich kid who gets trapped on an island, has to master the use of a bow and arrow to survive, and develops a purpose in life by fighting greed and corruption once he finds his way back home? That's the story of Oliver Queen — who's similar to Bruce Wayne in that his choice to use his immense wealth to fund his fight for justice is his superpower. In live-action roles, Green Arrow has been portrayed by Justin Hartley on \"Smallville,\" Stephen Amell in the Arrowverse series on the CW, and Joseph David-Jones as the Connor Hawke Green Arrow in \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow.\"First appearance: Action Comics #1 (June 1938)Created by: Jerry Siegel and Joe ShusterWhy we love them: Put simply, Superman is the hero that everyone else looks up to — the one that everyone else wants to be. It's his sheer goodness and drive to do the right thing that makes his appeal so enduring. His amazing powers don't hurt, but they wouldn't work without his innate goodness.Superman has been portrayed in live-action form by George Reeves in the \"Adventures of Superman\" ‘50s TV series and the \"Superman and the Mole Men\" movie; Christopher Reeve in the \"Superman,\" \"Superman II,\" \"Superman III,\" and \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\" movies; Dean Cain in the \"Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" series; Tom Welling as Clark Kent pre-Superman in \"Smallville\"; Brandon Routh in the movie \"Superman Returns,\" Henry Cavill in the movies \"Man of Steel,\" \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" and \"Justice League\"; and Tyler Hoechlin on \"Supergirl.\"  First appearance: All-Star Comics #8 (December 1941)Created by: William Moulton Marston, Elizabeth Holloway Marston, Olive Byrne, Harry G. PeterWhy we love them: So many heroes have a tragic origin story that spurs them to become the best possible versions of themselves — but not Wonder Woman. Formed out of clay, given life by Zeus, and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta on the Paradise Island inhabited only by women — also known as Themyscira — Diana's origin story is the stuff of very pleasant dreams rather than fevered nightmares. And then she proceeds to fight with love — not with anger, nor with hastily weaponized hate. This simple choice is what makes her unique among superheroes. Despite her status as an internationally beloved character whose fame has only grown over the many years she's been around, Wonder Woman has had relatively few live-action depictions onscreen. She's been played by Cathy Lee Crosby in the 1974 made-for-TV \"Wonder Woman\" movie, by Lynda Carter in the \"Wonder Woman\" TV series, and by Gal Gadot in \"Batman vs Superman,\" \"Justice League,\" and Patty Jenkins' 2017 \"Wonder Woman\" and upcoming \"Wonder Woman 1984\" films. First appearance: Detective Comics #27 (May 1939)Created by: Bob Kane and Bill FingerWhy we love them: The tale of a boy raised by his butler after his parents were horribly murdered in a dark alley by criminals — and who then grows up to use his detective skills and considerable financial resources to fight crime in his city — is practically irresistible. It's no wonder that various outlets have crowned Batman \"the greatest superhero ever.\" Live-action Batman turns have been performed by Adam West in the ‘60s \"Batman\" TV series; Michael Keaton in the Tim Burton-directed \"Batman\" and \"Batman Returns\" films; Val Kilmer in the \"Batman Forever\" film; George Clooney in the \"Batman and Robin\" film; Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy; David Mazouz as a young Bruce Wayne who is developing into Batman on the Fox TV series \"Gotham\"; and Ben Affleck in the DCEU films \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\" \"Suicide Squad,\" and \"Justice League.\"Visit INSIDER's homepage for more.\n",

      "www.cbr.com10 Comic Genres Matched With Members Of The Justice LeagueOf the DC Heroes that make up the Justice League, which one would represent each major comic genre?The comics industry survives on constantly being innovative. But underneath the crazy storylines, personal and emotional moments, or even the massive action sequences, the foundation of this industry is the genres that these comic titles emulate.RELATED: 10 Forgotten Kids of Justice League MembersThe Justice League, of course, falls into the superhero genre, but each of its members represents a slightly different type of narrative. Over the years there have been a variety of different members of the group, with each bringing a slightly different method of storytelling, or a variation on the tone and atmosphere normally set out in the comics.Batman is known as the world's greatest detective and loves to operate in the shadows. It's not surprising, therefore, that the themes of the noir genre work extremely well with the character.From the crime mystery element, to the grim and shady style of artwork, most Batman stories actually naturally fall into this genre. There was even a comic called Batman Noir, which certainly drives this concept even further.Mythology has a strong holding in comics. The genre is made up of the ancient legends that have defined humanity. Whether it's the focus on the Norse gods Thor and Loki in Marvel, or perhaps the DC Universes' take on the Greek pantheon.Wonder Woman's comics often balance a variety of genres but none more so than mythology. Recent comics even saw the Amazonian warrior visit ancient Aztec gods, with the character highlighting the myths of many ancient civilisations.The space opera is a very specific genre. While it plays on both fantasy and science fiction elements, it also draws into a specific type of drama. It therefore normally features a narrative based on much larger themes of family and ideology.RELATED: 10 Best Justice League Origins, RankedSuperman represents the House of El, who is constantly pitted against the Luthors and the Zods. These factions are distinctive, with heroes like Supergirl helping to make this a true family affair. The stakes are much more than saving the world, but about restoring hope to humanity.There are many heroes within the Justice League that could play into this genre, but none more so than the Green Lantern. Many of his comic book stories actually reflect some of the greatest sci-fi stories.Whether it's the origin of being chosen by some alien society, or perhaps the variety of species and planets within these tales. Each issue feels as if it was developed in the minds of H.G. Wells and Philip K. Dick.There are two variations on the sword genre. There is the sword and sandal piece, which reflects some of the mythological and historical elements of Wonder Woman. Then there is sword and sorcery, which plays closer to that of Merlin and King Arthur.It's fair to say that if Zatanna found herself in Camelot she'd fit right in. Fighting ancient demons, mythical creatures, and dark magic, many of the elements that go into a modern Zatanna story can be traced back to the knights of the round table and other similar motifs.The fantasy genre is a huge influence on the comics industry. While some titles decide to move away from these influences and towards traditional superhero storytelling, Shazam manages to keep coming back to these ideas.RELATED: 5 Justice League Rosters That Could Take Down Thanos (& 5 That Would Get Snapped)It would be easy to turn the Shazam mythology into one of modern sci-fi, yet with the magic, types of villains and the mystical origins involving an old sorcerer all contributing to a unique take on the Captain Marvel character.The horror genre isn't explored often enough in comics. Although the Justice League Dark was created to try and rectify this, the Swamp-Thing character has been defining this category for years.Reflective of the Hollywood monster movies, Swamp-Thing explored the humanity within the creature, stepping on the toes of many other horror based projects and highlighting the narrative gap in the market. The character represents what the genre is at its core.DC doesn't tend to play into the comedy genre often. While some of their characters are funny, there are very few ongoing titles that could actually be considered to be a part of this category.Despite this, Plastic Man is the perfect example of a character, that from his power set to his personality, absolutely embodies this genre. He is often the relief on the team and the wackier design makes him a great embodiment of that comedic tone.The western genre can be applied to a couple of different characters. While an obvious choice is Jonah Hex, he is not considered to be an official member of a Justice League team. Batman could be seen as a gunslinger (without the weapons of course).But the Green Arrow might be one of the few heroes who truly links to the western spirit. The lone vigilante takes his justice seeking job very seriously. His motorbike is his steed, and his bow and arrow his gun. He's been in many shootouts and reflects a lot of western imagery.There's been a few different versions of the Question, but some have served on the Justice League and others have teamed up alongside them, as part of the Birds of Prey.The Question is an extremely talented detective. If DC is looking for a crime thriller story then The Question is the natural hero to write about. They are hellbent of getting to the truth of the matter and also occasionally plays on the noir themes discussed previously.NEXT: DC: Ranking The Top 10 Members Of The Justice League By PersonalityPolitics graduate, freelance writer and all around film geek. If George isn't lecturing someone on the history of the MCU, he's probably ranting about the political consequences of Putin's latest horse riding trip.The Best 100 DC Comics Since Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985)!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansAugust 22, 2020 by Comic Book Herald Staff 7 Comments In April 1985, DC Comics kicked off the most momentous event in their shared universe’s modern history. Comics superstars Marv Wolfman and George Perez’s Crisis on Infinite Earths delivered cosmic ramifications that rippled across DC’s Multiverse and remain to this day. By the time the twelfth issue concluded the event in March 1986, DC Comics was irrevocably split into a history pre and post-Crisis.For best of DC Comics list-making purposes, this is both essential to acknowledge, and frankly a relief! While Comic Book Herald has guides covering DC’s earlier years starting with Action Comics #1, it’s useful to focus in on the “Post-Crisis” landscape of the modern DC Universe.A few caveats about the list:Otherwise, I think “the best DC Comics of the modern era!” is pretty self-explanatory.

In the hands of Moore and artists like John Totleben and Stephen Bissette, with editor Karen Berger protecting their vision and in the process defanging the Comics Code Authority and paving the way for Vertigo Comics, Swamp Thing became fertile ground for Moore’s imagination. From the groundbreaking, redefining “Anatomy Lesson” to the interspecies love of “Rite of Spring” to the psychedelic space journey of its final issues, Moore’s time on Swamp Thing is remarkable for the amount of depth it gave to its characters and massive variety of themes it explored.It also dared to publish stories that made mainstream readers look at DC Comics in a new light through its heavily philosophical approach and grotesque body horror. It’s no small exaggeration to say that Moore’s Swamp Thing became a foundational text for generations to follow. And it shows just how much could be done with an unloved character when a creator has a passion for comics and a willingness to explore both heady and difficult themes through their work. — Matt DraperCreators: Frank Miller, David MazzuchelliIssues: Batman #404-407Every legend has to start somewhere, even the Batman. However, Batman: Year One acts as not only an insight to Batman’s first year, but for Detective Jim Gordon as well. The now inescapable storyline chronicles the ups and downs of learning to work in Gotham City. For Bruce Wayne, it’s trying to understand how best to go about his mission. Applying theatricality and understanding the tools necessary to strike fear in the hearts of the wicked. While from Gordon’s point of view, his first year revolves around navigating the crooked underbelly of the Gotham Police Department. The pair mirror each other well in a fantastic tale that is certainly worth its legacy. — Mikayla LairdCreators: John Byrne, Dick GiordanoIssues: Man of Steel #1 to #6Man of Steel is perhaps Superman in his purest form. Stripping Superman of some of the more outlandish powers of the Silver Age, and reinventing the character, in a simpler, modern era, Man of Steel sees Clark Kent taken back to his roots, learning his place in his world. We see Clark gaining his costume, particularly as a tribute to both sets of parents, moving to Metropolis and meeting Batman. Man of Steel is arguably the quintessential Superman origin story, and the reinvention of the world around him, especially in the form of Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. For modern day Superman fans, this is your point of origin. — Mikayla LairdCreators: George PerezIssues: Wonder Woman #1 to #62, War of the GodsGeorge Perez’s reboot of Wonder Woman does something all-too-rare in superhero comics: uses the actions of its characters and worldbuilding to express and explore powerful themes, rather than simply wallpapering a stock superhero story with ultimately hollow thematic signifiers. Diana is explicitly made a feminist, and feminine, rebuttal to the “standard” archetype of superheroics (read: masculine), with love and mercy wielded alongside strength and pragmatism. But this complexity of character doesn’t weigh down a book this well-plotted and paced (not to mention gorgeously pencilled by Perez), which re-establishes Diana’s core connection to Greek mythology while deftly moving us through a riveting reboot of her origin.Compare the first seven issue arc, “Gods & Mortals,” with the 2017 film and see how Perez’s ending profoundly honors Diana as a character more than any “climactic” fistfight ever could. — Zack DeaneCreators: Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Lynn VarleyIssues: Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #1 to #4As the car goes racing across the track, about to speed out of control, Bruce thinks to himself, “This would be a good death.” It’s been many years since The Batman retired, he’s been gone for long enough that the younger generation believe he’s nothing but a myth. Bruce Wayne continues to live his life, but is still upset with the state of the world. One night, he finds himself back in the Batcave and decides to put the costume on again. However, the return of the Batman also brings with it the return of villains, as well as an untrusting world that isn’t too sure whether or not to trust him again, or even if this is the same person Gotham once knew. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, John HigginsIssues: Watchmen #1 to #12Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons and John Higgins’ classic masterpiece. Often mischaracterized as deconstructionist, ‘realistic’, or ‘cynical’, Watchmen is so, so much more. It’s a trailblazer for how superhero stories could be told, what was actually possible with them, and how they could be utilized to pose and explore powerful questions. Watchmen is a guidebook on how to use formalism to enhance your story, and to tell stories in fresh new ways, whether it be through prose backmatter, the 9-panel grid, or cutting across genres, and coloring.It’s a book about humanity, and how we are all we have, and how even in the face of absolute Armageddon, we can be kind and decent to one another. We’re all we have, so we have to watch out for one another, eh? That’s Watchmen. So read, and watch, for there are masters at work here. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, Tom ZiukoIssues: Superman Annual #11 (1985)While this list is predominantly full of full graphic novels and lengthy runs, I have to acknowledge some of Moore’s smaller work across the DC Universe, and there aren’t many that stick with me more than “For the Man Who Has Everything.” Alongside Watchmen collaborator Dave Gibbons, Moore and team weave a perfect one and done story about Mongul invading the Fortress of Solitude and using the “Black Mercy” to make Superman think he has everything he ever wanted back home on Krypton. The issue was later translated in the 2000’s animated Justice League Unlimited and feels as timeless as ever.  — DaveCreators: JM Dematteis, Keith Giffen, Kevin MaGuireIssues: Justice League #1 to #6, Justice League International #7 to #25, Justice League America #26 to #30, Justice League Europe #1 to #6DeMatteis, Giffen and MaGuire’s post-Crisis Justice League remains a breath of fresh air, a gorgeous influx of cartoon whimsy in the heart of “Comics aren’t just for kids anymore!” fever. It’s also a miracle this book even happened, with an approach to Justice League so tonally inconsistent with historic expectations the series was retitled to Justice League International (and the eventual spinoff Justice League Europe) within six issues. It’s easy to reduce the run to the comedic tenor and “One Punch!” but JLI is also the series that made Booster Gold, Blue Beetle, Fire, Ice, Guy Gardner, Captain Atom and a host of others (including the rejuvenation of Scott Free and Big Barda!) forever matter to DC fans. — DaveCreators: Jim Starlin, Mike Mignola, Carlos Garzon, Steve OliffIssues: Cosmic Odyssey #1 to #4Independently, Jim Starlin and Mike Mignola are some of my favorite comic book creators of all time, with Starlin’s Marvel Cosmic work of the 70’s and early 90’s perfecting the framework that gave the world Thanos, and Mignola’s Hellboy universe standing out as one of the best achievements in comics. Before Hellboy and Infinity Gauntlet, the creators teamed up for 1988’s Cosmic Odyssey, a miniseries/event that finds Darkseid seeking the aid of Earth’s heroes and New Genesis. Whereas Legends worked to re-establish the presence of Kirby’s Darkseid as a post-Crisis DCU big bad, Cosmic Odyssey actually delivers a 4th World crossover worthy of the legacy. — DaveCreators: Denny O’Neil, Denys Cowan, Rick MagyarIssues: The Question #1 to #36This masterpiece of a series resurrects the faceless vigilante and sets him in search of himself. But that’s not its only fantastic metaphor, as the book nakedly captured famous Bat-Editor Denny O’Neil’s own recovery from drugs and alcohol in real-time. This lends it both sympathy and power as both Sage and O’Neil search for “the wisdom to tell the difference” in a world of things they cannot change. O’Neil and The Question rewrite concepts like justice, fairness, drive, and survival, all of which become big influences on Miller’s Batman, Brubaker’s Cap/Winter Soldier, and arguably Moore’s Watchmen. And Cowan’s pencils and Magyar’s inks are superb; part film, part fashion shoot (the panels! the poses!), influencing everyone from Miller to Liefeld to Mack. — John GalatiCreators: John Ostrander, Luke McDonnell, Kim YaleIssues: Suicide Squad #1 to #66Trying to imagine the DC Universe without the Suicide Squad is nearly impossible, but pre-Crisis Task Force X was a forgotten concept, until John Ostrander, Luke McDonnell and Kim Yale launched this modern version that resonates today. Suicide Squad is easily one of the best superhero concepts to arise from this era of DC Comics, putting assorted imprisoned DC supervillains to use as a Black Ops arm of the US government (Yep, it’s The Dirty Dozen for capes). In Squad, Amanda Waller, Floyd Lawton (Deadshot), Boomerang and many more became unforgettable central pillars of the DC Universe at large. As a whole, the series is remarkably effective at exploring the psychology of the squad, while simultaneously throwing them into political/global turmoil that frequently results in failed missions and “terminated” members. It’s a testament to the work of everyone involved that the killer concept has never been this good since. — DaveCreators: John Ostrander, Kim Yale, Luke McDonnellIssues: Deadshot #1 to #4The Suicide Squad, well, squad (#squadsquad) double down on their efforts to make Floyd Lawton the most complex psyche in the series (at least this side of Amanda Waller), in a solo story with some truly surprising twists. In theory, you could easily lump this in with the larger Suicide Squad run and the late 80’s exploration of the underbelly of crime in the DC Universe. These four issues stand out on their own, though, both as essential facets to making Deadshot an interesting villain/anti-hero, and frankly as a testament to just how bleak late 80’s DC could get. — DaveCreators: Mike GrellIssues: Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters #1 to #3While the transformation begins with Denny O’Neil and Neal Adams Green Lantern/Green Arrow in the early 70’s, the post-Crisis maturation of Oliver Queen is all Mike Grell, starting with the 3 issue Longbow Hunters miniseries and on into the long running ongoing series that began in 1988. It’s an oversimplification, but Grell’s Green Arrow is closer to Marvel’s Punisher with a bow and arrow than the legacy of trick arrows and that Robin Hood get-up would ever have you believe. Much like The Killing Joke, critical re-examination of the work rightly addresses the handling of sexual violence and gender dynamics, so it’s also worth acknowledging the deep flaws at the root of the reinvention as you explore. — DaveCreators: Alan Moore, Brian BollandIssues: OGNOne bad day can change the course of your life. This is the philosophy of The Joker, once again anointed here as Batman’s greatest enemy. It’s a philosophy that both Batman and The Joker can connect to, as The Killing Joke explores brilliantly. After escaping Arkham Asylum, the Joker plans to put his theory into action, shooting Barbara Gordon through the spine, and kidnapping Commissioner Gordon. Interspliced with perhaps Joker’s most well-known origin story, Gordon is brutally tortured by the Joker’s henchmen, while Batman races against time to save him. The stunning art and strong writing make for a tale that stays with the reader long after the final page. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Tim TrumanIssues: Hawkworld #1 to #3There’s old comics you read, which feel dated. They’re a struggle, they’re a chore. Then you read old comics that feel like they could be published tomorrow. They’re works that last and work so well, even decades later. Tim Truman’s seminal Hawkworld mini-series is that brand of storytelling. It’s the rare Post-TDKR and Watchmen text that actually understands the lessons of those works. It’s the reboot of Hawkman that feels like a prestige HBO series, and it’s a big, political story about a man of privilege, a conservative cop, who realizes how broken the system he’s a part of is, and must cope with the horror of that.Fiercely contemporary, absolutely unyielding, and devastatingly honest in its observations, it’s a work that skewers the imperialism of Thanagar, which serves as a mirror for examinations of US imperialism. The Hawkworld? It isn’t in space, it’s down here on earth, everywhere around us. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Keith Giffen, Mary Bierbaum, Tom Bierbaum, Al GordonIssues: Adventures of Superman #478, Legion of Super-Heroes (1989) #1-39, Who’s Who #1-11, #13, #14, #16, Timber Wolf #1-5, and Legion of Super-Heroes Annual #1-3At this point, there are few things in Big 2 comics that quite get my attention like massive fan-favorite runs that somehow fall outside the collective consensus canon. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about comics, but I live for those moments when somebody says “Have you read 5YL?” and I have no idea what they’re talking about!This was absolutely the case with the Keith Giffen written and plotted 1989 Legion of Super-Heroes relaunch, the divisive “Five Years Later” timeline. Conceptually, 5YL is brilliant, throwing readers into the deep end of Legion lore, five years (sing it with me David Bowie style, “FIVE YEARS!!!”) after the end of the “Magic Wars,” and with the perpetually teenage Legion suddenly grown up and often struggling. It’s not the Legion your pops grew up with in the Silver Age, and it’s not even the celebrated Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen Legion from a few years prior. Ultimately, that’s the point.– DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Dave McKeanIssues: OGNEven with Morrison’s full script and numerous rereads, Arkham Asylum is borderline incomprehensible. Jungian psychology overlaid on geometric symbolism underlined with the jumbled and dark art of Dave McKean makes “A Serious House on Serious Earth” a challenging read for anyone. Combine that with a Batman who feels completely weak and ineffectual and it becomes obvious from the start that Morrison is more interested in Batman’s mental state than his actions. Arkham Asylum came out in the wake of the trail-blazing “The Dark Knight Returns” and “The Killing Joke,” which paved the wave for new takes on Batman. But Morrison’s work is the rejection of those stories and their imitators’ focus on realism in favor of maddening symbolism. And its success rocketed Morrison to superstardom.It’s a disturbing piece of symbolic existential horror that terrifies the reader by letting our imaginations run wild as we probe the terrors lurking within the subconscious mind. Morrison would go on to write more literal, action-oriented Batman stories that probe the The Dark Knight’s ego, but Arkham Asylum feels like Morrison grabbing a live wire and channeling that energy right into the reader. You can’t help but feel both empowered and repulsed by it. — Matt DraperCreators: JM Dematteis, Shawn McManus, Mark McKennaIssues: Doctor Fate #1 to #24The Dematteis, MacManus, McKenna era of the new Doctor Fate is easily among the most underrated selections on this entire list, and for my money the most underrated. None of these comics are even collected by DC! It’s far from a perfect run, but following DeMatteis and Keith Giffen’s Doctor Fate miniseries resolving the fate of Kent Nelson (well, sorta), Fate becomes a supernatural hero inhabited by two distinct personalities, one male and childlike, and one female. The series quickly explores the Lords of Chaos and Order, interjecting I, Vampire into the proceedings, and maintaining a madcap sense of humor throughout it all. — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Richard CaseIssues: Doom Patrol #19 to #63The World’s Strangest Heroes. They’re a lively bunch, and a wonderful concept, but after their initial Silver Age run ended, The Doom Patrol spent an absurd amount of time not being what their motto promised. They were fairly standard superheroes, in a book that reflected that.Enter: Grant Morrison, Richard Case, and John Workman. The now legendary creative team reshaped that entire world, pushing the central concept to its absolute limits, and taking it to realms it had never been. A spiritual successor to Gerber’s Defenders, in a Claremont X-world, Morrison’s vision was a hurricane of neverending big ideas, influenced by everything from Dadaism to experimental European filmmaking. By the time it was over, one thing was clear: This was the defining run, now and forever. As the concept’s creator Arnold Drake put it, this is the one run that understood the concept and fulfilled its intentions best, even better than its own creator. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Grant Morrison, Chas Truog, Tom GrummettIssues: Animal Man #1 to #26Grant Morrison has made an entire career out of doing the impossible. In this case, starting with a 60s c-list superhero who borrows “powers” from animals (?!). A character that Carmine Infantino probably banged out before lunch. Morrison dusts him off, gives him a modern family and a very modern cause. And he makes them live on the lid of a jack-in-the-box. The story is covered by a goofy Saturday morning cartoon. But inside of that is a warhead of philosophy and emotion, just waiting for its musical queue. That’s impressive all by itself. But the fact the book respects its audience enough to ask them to not only think but search inside themselves? Like I said, impossible. — John GalatiCreators: Ron Marz, Darryl BanksIssues: Green Lantern (Vol 3) #48 to #55When Superman “died,” Hal Jordan took on his cosmic foes. But when Superman returned, the threat to Jordan remained. This is the story of how Jordan failed to save his home, Coast City, and how Superman and the universe failed Jordan again and again.  Marz, Willingham, Haynes, and co, do an astounding job of capturing the grief and terror of a Green Lantern in mourning. But they also capture something else: the ending, where only a single Guardian is left alive with a single ring. The ring sets out to find the last champion left in the universe: a bust-out artist who would become the most powerful Lantern of all. That arc from tragedy to comedy is difficult but rewarding, some middle part from the Zero Hour editorial debacle! — John GalatiCreators: Mark Waid, Greg LarocqueIssues: The Flash #62 to #128There’s normal runs, and then there’s Chase-The-Dragon runs. Runs so definitive and defining, they overshadow, subsume and become almost the entirety of a franchise, with almost everything after being in response, or in pursuit of it. There is almost no way to separate the work from the fabric of the fiction, it’s seeped in deep and far too ingrained now. That’s Mark Waid’s Flash. From Speed Forces, Flash Families, Reverse Flashes to legendary legacies, this run is what made the character for not just a generation, but every generation after.\n",
      "\n",
      "Waid took John Broome and Carmine Infantino’s vibrant creation, who’d rusted to become a dull conservative, and put new life, and genuine heart into him. A whole slew of disparate characters found thematic unity under his pen, with legacy and family being essential. Waid did the impossible in Big Two comics: He made the successor surpass the mentor. Wally West with The Flash Family, was The Flash. — Ritesh BabuCreators: James Robinson, Paul SmithIssues: The Golden Age #1 to #4In truth, I’ve never understood JSA-heads. Unless you’re literally my dad (in which case, thanks for everything pops!) the thrills of the Golden Age generation are a wonderful concept and legacy in the DC Universe that I only occasionally want to focus on directly. Perhaps that’s why the Watchmen’s Minutemen meets Wild Cards Book One approach of Robinson and Smith’s JSA: The Golden Age resonates most. In this alternate post World War II America, the Justice Society of America has largely hung up the tights just in time for McCarthyism and the House of Unamerican Activities Committee. For his part, Robinson would go on to greater heights exploring legacy in the DC Universe in the pages of Starman, but “The Golden Age” is a notable progression getting there. — DaveCreators: Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, Alan GrantIssues: Batman: Vengeance of Bane Special #1, Batman #491-500, Detective Comics #659-666, Showcase ’93 #7-8 and Batman: Shadow of the Bat #16-18The all-star talent behind this had insanely ambitious goals. “The Jailbreak at Arkham” act is a perfect (re)introduction to the title, yet the full arc concludes six years of a “breaking the Bat” narrative that stretches from Death in the Family to Death of Superman. (In fact, Knightfall improves/fixes the year-old DoS story concept itself.) But most shocking of all: it’s a major bat-event with very little Joker. Instead, Knightfall takes Bane—then the newest bat-villain—to the top slot, making him Kraven to Batman’s Spider-Man; a multi-threat, multi-avenue predator who can shake their foe to the absolute core. You can hear echoes of Knightfall in everything from Hush to Winter Soldier. Now if we could just undo Schumacher’s Trenchcoat Bane… — John GalatiCreators: Dan Jurgens, Jerry Ordway, Louise Simonson, Roger Stern, John Bogdanove, Tom Grummett, Jackson Guice, moreIssues: Superman: The Man of Steel #18-19, Justice League America #69, Superman #74-75, Adventures of Superman #497, and Action Comics #684The event that shocked the world, can the Man of Steel ever truly be killed in battle? The year long event saw not only the death of Superman at the hands of Doomsday, but the mystery of the 4 new Supermen. Each claiming to be the successor to the Superman title. Each of the four Supermen, Superboy, Steel, Cyborg Superman and the Eradicator, highlight an aspect of Superman, but as the story goes on, it’s clear that there is no true replacement for Superman. The question now becomes, how do you resurrect the man who shouldn’t have died in the first place? — Mikayla LairdCreators: Jeph Loeb, Tim SaleIssues: The Long Halloween #0 to #13, Dark Victory #0 to #13The creative team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale have basically crafted a masterpiece every time they’ve worked together, but they may be most directly tied to their two titanic Batman miniseries. “The Long Halloween” serves as a replacement Year Two for The Dark Knight, tying up loose ends from Frank Miller’s “Year One” while transitioning Gotham from a gangster’s paradise to a freakish playground. “Dark Victory” wraps up the lingering ideas of “Halloween” while reversing that first story’s bleak musings on Batman by providing a new origin for Dick Grayson’s Robin. Each works as a compelling, cartoonishly gothic mystery that mentally and emotionally challenges Batman while also working as a far-better blockbuster comic than Loeb’s later, also villain-stuffed, “Hush.”Best of all, both of these stories serve as compelling narratives for Harvey Dent, both before and after his transformation into Two-Face. When done right, Dent is a tragic figure that reflects Bruce Wayne’s darkest impulses. By affording Dent with nearly as much narrative real estate as his title hero, the duality of Two-Face makes both “Long Halloween” and “Dark Victory” into stories that can be read for their sheer thrills as well as their ruminations on human psychology. — Matt DraperCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: Flex Mentallo: Man of Muscle Mystery #1 to #4The character of Flex Mentallo, Hero of the Beach, is one of many reasons Morrison’s time writing Doom Patrol is among my top 10 favorite comics of all time. There’s something so impossibly comical and powerful about muscle mystery, the ode to Silver Age comic book advertisements, and the ability to flex the Pentagon into a circle. Morrison returned to Flex in 1996 with artist Frank Quitely (in what would become one of comics most celebrated collaborations), and a challenging, meta-fictional and deeply fascinating four issue miniseries. Flex breaks the mold of superhero comics tropes even moreso than Doom Patrol, while simultaneously laying down the philosophy of a unified superhero landscape, with Morrison really leaning into the one million ideas a minute approach to comics that has defined so much of his work since.Quitely is absolutely a breath of fresh air in the ’96 artistic canon, and all in all Flex Mentallo is a fascinating book for readers well-versed in Morrison-ology. Perhaps the work says it best: “I just wanted to talk about the comics, see? All those sh***y, amazing comics…” — DaveCreators: Garth Ennis, Jamie Delano, Sean Phillips, Steve Hugh, Dave McKeanIssues: Hellblazer #34 to #46John Constantine is a great conman and an almost respectable magician. But his real superpower is his ability to go it completely alone. Seeing him grinding out every day, knowing that he’s learned to not even need Superman’s help, that makes audiences believe he can take on both Heaven and Hell. And Garth Ennis turned that strength into a mortal weakness. Seeing Constantine, wearing a teal hospital gown, yellow sodium light, with no one beside him as he looks at an x-ray seems to cut the strings off him. Then again, it also makes him his most dangerous. — John GalatiCreators: James Robinson, Tony Harris, Peter Snejbjerg, Wade Von GrawbadgerIssues: Starman #1 to #81DC Comics of the 1990’s are uniquely positioned to create, establish and respond to the idea of legacy in an eternal shared story. Throughout the decade we see Kyle Rayner come into his own as Green Lantern, Wally West really become The Flash, Tim Drake become Robin, and as we can all agree, Cyborg Superman and Jean-Paul Valley cementing their claims as World’s Finest (ok, not all legacies are built equally).My favorite saga of legacy, though, comes from a lesser known franchise, with Starman and The Knight family taking center stage in James Robinson and Tony Harris’ long-running series. The path of Starman taps into so much of what makes the DC Universe a thrilling space, fleshing out the mythical Opal City, seamlessly connecting the tapestry of DC’s history from Justice Society to present day, and making everyone from The Shade to Mist some of the coolest supporting characters in the world. This is Robinson at his absolute best, and Tony Harris’ work is simply some of the finest in contemporary superhero comics.  — DaveCreators: Garth Ennis, John McCreaIssues: Hitman #1 to #60Tommy Monaghan is to the Punisher as John Constantine is to Doctor Strange. He’s a smart-mouthed working man, always hard on his luck, trying to figure out how to operate a work/life balance and failing. It’s a fantastic test bed for Ennis’s violent humor. For many, the series apexes with issue 34, Of Thee I Sing (often called “the best Superman story ever.”) And while Ennis does a masterful job of revealing the Man of Steel to be just as unsure and vulnerable as the rest of us, the issue works because of how strong a character Monaghan becomes. The crux of the issue is that when Monaghan tells Superman he’s wrong, we all believe Tommy. — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Howard PorterIssues: JLA #1 to #41As much as I love Justice League International, and all its many quirks, JLA by Morrison and Porter is the book that demands DC’s Justice League reflects the absolute core of the universe, with a central lineup revolving around Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash (Wally West), Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner), and Martian Manhunter. The quirks will certainly come (the comedic relief of Plastic Man, the surprise inclusion of Huntress), but this is a foundation built to matter. It’s an all time great run, zipping between Martian invasions, Apokoliptan futures, World War III, and everything in between. If you haven’t read a Justice League comic that really worked for you before, it might just mean you haven’t read JLA. — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Drew Geraci, variousIssues: Event/CrossoversThe Justice League are certainly a staple in the DC universe, but it’s hard to believe that any of its members would expect the League to still exist in the 853rd century. As they are visited by their future counterparts, the Justice League are invited to the future in order to attend a ceremony marking the return of Superman. However, not all is as it seems, as the Justice League are separated across the solar system, as a conspiracy theory begins to unfold. Beyond its primary story, DC One Million also finds itself with a multitude of tie-in stories, fleshing out the future of the DC Universe.  — Mikayla LairdCreators: Mark Waid, Alex RossIssues: OGNDon’t let the wanton destruction and copious deaths fool you, Mark Waid and Alex Ross’ “Kingdom Come” is actually a bold strike against the grim and gritty ‘90s. In this dystopian future, the classic heroes of DC Comics have grown old and out of fashion, replaced with lethal vigilantes. But when a retired Superman returns, the clash between young and old may destroy the world. Ross’s hyper realistic paintings are on full display here with bold hero shots and scenes of titanic battles, but it’s Waid’s juxtaposition of the Book of Revelation and meta commentary on the comic book industry of the ‘90s that adds greater weight to a story of idealistic heroes changing and being tempted to fall. Seeing figures like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman come as close as possible to failing the morals that have shaped them for generations and then reembracing the hope that defines them ultimately makes Kingdom Come an inspirational story because of its edge of cynicism.More than 20 years later, it still feels like DC Comics is living in the future shadow of Kingdom Come, guiding its way and standing as a bold critique against the publisher’s tendency to make its heroes and readers suffer. — Matt DraperCreators: Paul Dini, Bruce TimmIssues: Batman Adventures Annual #1-2, Batman Adventures Holiday Special, Adventures In The Dc Universe #3 And Batman Black And White #1The origin from one of Batman the Animated Series most celebrated episodes, Mad Love shows a dark and disturbing side to the relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker. Harley is desperate to help the Joker and see him smile, but every time she tries to help, he ends up pushing her away, usually out of a window. The relationship between Harley and Joker is front and centre as the story also acts as an origin story for Harley, reliving the events that put her in this situation. Mad Love is definitive in how it set the tone for Harley and Joker stories moving forward, especially when it comes to Harley’s reimagining within DC Comics. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Jeph Loeb, Tim SaleIssues: Superman For All Seasons #1-4One of the most important elements to a Superman origin story is how the world reacts to him. In For All Seasons, we see four phases of Superman’s early development, mirroring the four seasons of a year. Each season is narrated by someone close to Clark and provides unique perspectives on his life. The story primarily spans from the time Clark leaves Smallville, to establishing himself in Metropolis as a protector. The way the story reflects the changing seasons makes it unique when it comes to early Superman tales. The brilliant team of Loeb and Sale tell a truly beautiful tale, with some amazing stand out moments that really grounds Clark Kent. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Walt SimonsonIssues: Orion #1 to #25The influence of Jack Kirby’s 4th World is emminently clear in post-Crisis DC right out of the gates, with Darkseid taking central roles in the likes of Legends or Cosmic Odyssey (not to mention the previously referenced JLA “Rock of Ages”). Still, there’s not a ton of actual New Gods comics worthy of a best-of conversation (Although let me be among the first to nominate John Byrne’s Genesis for a worst-of conversation) until you get to Kirby acolyte and all-time great Walt Simonson’s run on Orion. While it’s not quite as good or all-encompassing as Simonson’s Thor for Marvel, Orion is a gorgeous work that digs deep into both the life of Darkseid’s son raised on New Genesis, and the mythology of the 4th World. Frankly, a very good “in” to the New Gods for readers newer to DC.– DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: OGNWhat happens when you must revamp classic Gardner Fox Justice League concepts in a Post-Crisis world without a multiverse? Well, this. \n",
      "\n",
      "Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely’s revival of The Crime Syndicate and Earth-3 is one that splices together Gardner Fox notions with John Broome brilliance, to recreate the realm of Earth-3 in The Anti-Matter Universe. Quitely’s very much in his Post-Flex and Pre-All-Star phase, lending the book an odd visual quality, as it explodes with prime 2000s widescreen cinematic flair. It’s a bit weird, a bit creepy, and all in all, becomes the modern bedrock for interpreting both Earth-3 and Anti-Matter, influencing everything that’d come after, whether it be Dwayne McDuffie movies or New 52 reboots.\n",

If All-Star Superman is the revered ideal 12-part conclusion and endpoint for the character, Birthright is the ideal 12-part beginning. It spans everything from his time in Smallville to his establishment of Superman, and just what that actually means. It’s the Post-Byrne rehabilitation of the character which displaces shame for what before with an earnest sincerity that works. It goes so far that it reworks the classic Silver Age Superboy-Lex Luthor friendship and hair loss story into a touching, sweet tale of youth, companionship, and separation.Whether it be playing Krypton with a grandeur and majesty rarely seen, or centering more on Lara and Ma Kent than the men as most do, Birthright is an emotionally honest, touching update to The Man Of Tomorrow. All that and maybe the best single splash image to sum up who Superman is, ever. It’s all in there. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Scott Beatty, , Marcos Martin, Javier Pulido, Robert Campanella, Alvaro Lopez, Chuck DixonIssues: Robin: Year One #1 to #4, Batgirl: Year One #1 to #9One of the absolute coolest things about this “Year One” combo platter is the powerhouse artistic might of Javier Pulido on “Robin” and Marcos Martin on “Batgirl.” These are fantastic looking origin flashbacks, in the vein of Miller/Mazzuchelli on Batman: Year One but of course never trying too desperately to emulate those impossible standards. With years of Nightwing under our belt as seasoned DC readers, it’s also fascinating and refreshing to reflect back on Dick Grayson’s earliest days as Batman’s boy wonder, and just what exactly drove him to play the part. Batgirl experty treads similar ground for Barbara Gordon, already in her Oracle role in continuity as the flashbacks were coming out. There’s more of a tragedy at the heart of Batgirl’s “Year One,” knowing what Killing Joke has in wait, but it’s still glorious to watch Marcos Martin and Alvaro Lopez deliver a kick from Babs right into the face of Killer Moth. — DaveCreators: Kyle BakerIssues: Plastic Man #1 to #20Incredibly gifted cartoonist Kyle Baker takes the Golden Age comedy ethos of Plastic Man and transports it into a run unlike anything else DC Comics was producing (or honestly, is producing today!). Plastic Man is Baker’s vision of Eel O’Brien reconciling his past as a criminal, but through the lens of Looney Toons, newspaper strips, and Roger Rabbit. If you’re looking for capital “S” serious comics, keep on skimming, but for pure lighthearted storytelling bliss, check out Plastic Man.  — DaveCreators: Mark Weid, Barry Kitson, Tom PeyerIssues: Flash & Green Lantern #1 to #6Few writers have mined DC’s past to the extent Mark Waid has. Even fewer still have his wild encyclopedic understanding of that world. So fitting then that he tackles the two vital silver age icons handled and established as friends by John Broome in the 60s. A pseudo-successor to his and Kitson’s JLA: Year One, Brave and the Bold goes through the wild, weird history of The Flash and Green Lantern, Barry Allen and Hal Jordan, and mines for the heart amidst all the strange trappings of The Silver Age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accessible to newcomers, but reverent towards the old in a way that is pleasing for older readers, the book is, in essence, Waid’s platonic ideal of superhero comics. Fun, quick, earnest and rooted in their history. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Mark Waid, Howard Porter, variousIssues: JLA #43 to #46The absolute unbeatable machismo of the man dressed like a bit took on new life with Morrison and Porter’s first arc on JLA, where Bruce Wayne stands alone against the White Martian threat and keeps the League together. Writer Mark Waid doubles down on that ethos in “Tower of Babel,” extending the thinking that the man who plans for every contingency would have all manner of weapons and plots at his disposal to keep the Justice League in check just in case. In Bruce’s defense, heroes tend to get mindcontrolled or zombiefied every other story arc, so you can at least see where he’s coming from. Obviously, Batman’s anti-League protocols fall into the wrong hands (in this case, the Al Ghuls) and the relationship between Batman and the League takes a notable turn, playing through DC Comics for the remainder of the 2000’s. — DaveCreators: Andy Diggle, JockIssues: Green Arrow Year One #1 to #8For anyone who hasn’t seen LOST, the success of CW’s “Arrow” (and the verse it spawned) can all be traced back to Green Arrow: Year One.  Andy Diggle and the artistic might of Jock combine to solidify Oliver Queen’s modern island origins. For me, this was an incredible introduction to the work of Jock who has since gone on to incredible heights in collaborations with Scott Snyder (for example, Batman: The Black Mirror, or Wytches). Incredibly, you can hand this ‘Year One’ story to just about anybody interested in the legacy of Oliver Queen, and watch them come away a newfound comic book fan. — DaveCreators: Kevin Smith, Phil HesterIssues: Green Arrow #1 to #10Speaking of the Emerald Archer, heading into the 2000’s, Oliver Queen was dead (literally) and directionless (editorially). Enter filmmaker Kevin Smith and artist Phil Hester, who put Ollie back on the map with an in-continuity revival that helps explain Green Arrow’s place in the DC Universe through the ages, and sets the stage for the role the character can play in the new millennium. Smith’s DC Comics writing definitely peaked with this story, but he gets a lot right introducing the Green Arrow to a new generation of readers.  — DaveCreators: Gail Simone, Ed BenesIssues: Birds of Prey #56 to #108Writer Gail Simone and frequent artistic collaborator Ed Benes didn’t create the Birds of Prey, but ask any fan of the comic about the team and series, and they’ll really without fail refer to the Simone era. This is where Barbara Gordon (Oracle), Dinah Lance (Black Canary), Helena Bertinelli (Huntress), and a rotating cast of interesting heroes, antiheroes and villains all truly come into their own as a unit. I don’t know that I can overstate the importance of making an all woman superhero squad this damn cool, when even attempting such a thing was (and remains!) a rarity in the DC Universe. Whether you’re a fan of the movie, or just looking for good comics, this run on Birds of Prey is a must. — DaveCreators: Greg Rucka, Drew Johnson, James RaizIssues: Wonder Woman #206 to #213Greg Rucka is commonly known and understood to be the definitive modern writer for Diana, and this first run, which is what leads to his eventual second run, is a good showcase for why. His interpretation of Diana as a political figure, icon, and writer, surrounded by Kythotaur (no, not Minotaur) chefs who cook only delicious vegetarian food and Supermen who edit her manuscript, is one that strikes a chord and feels at once classical yet fresh, particularly for its period. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s less of a straight forward superhero comic and more a thriller that’s heavily political, with conservatives who lose their mind at Diana’s progressivism to news show debates. It’s a run that’s messy, but yet also resonant in its messiness. You can’t not love Diana, our Wonder Woman, coming out of this. Rucka understood the very essence, the soul of the character. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Jeph Loeb, Jim LeeIssues: Batman #609 to #619Spend enough years reading too many comics and you’ll find an encroaching realization that plenty of immensely popular works that you loved on your journey to getting into comics aren’t particularly cool among the critically acclaimed and respected crowd. Hush by Loeb and Jim Lee is definitely one of those works. While ultimately it doesn’t matter what other people suggest you should think about a comic (says the guy compiling a list of the 100 best!), I’m certain I couldn’t read Hush now without sucumbing to the criticisms I’ve seen about the recycled “parade of villains” approach Loeb took from “The Long Halloween,” or about the absolute inanity of the titular Hush as a Batman villain anyone should pretend to care about.But when I read Hush in a library with as many comics as I could carry sitting in a stack next to me, voraciously reading one after the other as I rediscovered the joys of superhero stories? Oh yeah, Hush hit the damn spot. This is my favorite Jim Lee work of the 2000’s, as he makes the entire Batman Universe completely his own, and it’s the kind of story you can hand to anyone kinda interested in reading comics and hook them on the medium. That’s tremendously valuable, critics be gosh darned! — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Frank QuitelyIssues: All-Star Superman #1 to #12There’s a fine line that separates the tender humanity of Superman with the character’s super-sized mythology. And while the scope and scale of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely’s standalone miniseries “All-Star Superman” plays into The Man of Steel’s mythological trappings, with the 12 labors of Hercules informing its structure, it’s the humanity of the character that gives this story its emotional heft.The death of Morrison’s father a year prior served as the inspiration behind the central premise of “What if Superman had cancer?” But rather than falling into a fatalistic, disillusioned take on heroism, “All-Star” is all about one man making the most of every second of every day he has left. Of course, this being Morrison, there are plenty of metafictional moments centered on the nature of Superman as a timeless character and the structure of time, but it’s the moments where Superman speaks to the human strength of the people around him, such as a now-iconic suicide prevention or a trip to a child’s cancer ward, that makes All-Star a comic that understands all sides of its hero. In the end, Superman as a fictional creation is designed to inspire us to be better because, to quote Lex Luthor’s humanist revelation at the end of Morrison’s story, “It’s all just us, in here, together. And we’re all we’ve got.” — Matt DraperCreators: Ed Brubaker, Greg Rucka, Michael LarkIssues: Gotham Central #1 to #40What do Gotham Police do when Batman’s not around?That’s the central premise of “Gotham Central,” a police procedural by Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with art by Michael Lark and a rotating stable of artists. With Brubaker and Rucka alternating on short arcs, Gotham Central is able to shift its focus to quite a few different characters, each with their own investigative cases and character arcs. This is grounded, gritty storytelling in Gotham at its best because the characters, storylines, and genre necessitate it. And when larger than life figures like Batman or any number of his villains suddenly show up, they feel larger than life and justifiably terrifying.While Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen are the breakout stars of the title, with the Montoya-centric arc “Half a Life” earning acclaim and awards, a major part of the appeal of “Gotham Central” is its constant unexpected shifts from story to story. Brubaker and Rucka would both go on to further noir acclaim with “Criminal” and “Stumptown,” but their passion for the genre is what gives “Gotham Central” its spark. Life on the Gotham beat is dark, unsettling, and unpredictable, but seeing its toll on the men and women trying to save the city stays compelling even when there’s no bat in sight. — Matt DraperCreators: Marc Andreyko, Javier Pina, Jesus Saiz, Michael Gaydos, variousIssues: Manhunter #1 to #38While longtime DC fans may know Manhunter as Paul Kirk, perhaps from the fantastic 70’s stories by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson, the 2000’s set up Kate Spencer, district attorney and costumed street vigilante. Sure, it’s very much DC’s “Daredevil,” but Kate is a very welcome addition to the universe, with Marc Andreyko, Jesus Saiz and collaborators crafting a deeply underrated run during the era of Identity Crisis. They certainly have their differences, but I definitely think of Kate Spencer along the same tier as Renee Montoya for additions of women characters in the 2000’s that made the entire universe stronger, yet still find themselves not fully integrated in the year 2020. This run is a roadmap for how to make it happen. — DaveCreators: Darwyn Cooke, Ed Brubaker, Paul Gulacy, Jimmy PalmiottiIssues: Catwoman #1 to #37Darwyn Cooke and Ed Brubaker are absolute legends in the world of comics at this point (this list will certainly solidify that as we progress!), and their early 2000’s work on Selina Kyle and Catwoman is some of the best I’ve ever seen with the character. For my money, it’s actually the Catwoman story that very little has been able to capture since. Catwoman fits beautifully into the noir-crime world Cooke and Brubaker are so adept at bringing to life, making this a must-read for fans of either creator. — DaveCreators: Brad Meltzer, Rags MoralesIssues: Identity Crisis #1 to #7Let’s make one thing clear: Identity Crisis is one of the clearest examples of “fridging,” a storytelling cliche in which injury or death falls upon the hero’s loved one, spurring the heroes to action. It commits the age-old sin of framing the punishment of a woman around the anguish of the men who love her, rather than focusing on the women’s experience itself. Identity Crisis also exemplifies the worst impulses of comic writers: equating the inclusion of topics like murder and sexual assault with mature storytelling. However, for my money, this comic is one of the strongest stand-alone entry points into early 2000s DC Comics. Love it or hate it, this dark, brutal tone is here to stay for a time, and Identity Crisis ushers the reader through a compelling mystery that touches on most corners of the DC Universe with relentless energy and confidence. If you want to sum up the state of mid-2000s DC in one tight package, Identity Crisis is your comic.— Zack DeaneCreators: Judd Winick, Doug MahnkeIssues: Batman #635-641, #645-50 and Batman Annual #25First off, if you don’t know anything about Red Hood in the DC Universe, skip this blurb and read, baby, read. Red Hood has become an undeniable fixture since this story, so I tend to assume most DC fans with a casual knowledge of the universe who hides behind the hood. That said, Batman’s second Robin, Jason Todd, was killed (after a preposterous, wait-that-really-happened? fan vote) in 1988. 15+ years later creators Judd Winick and Dough Mahnke returned to Todd in “Under the Red Hood,” exploring what would happen if he came back, and had a serious axe to grind with Batman for letting his murderer, the Joker, run loose all these years. It’s far from the best Batman story ever told, but it explores a pretty common question in the world of Gotham (why does Batman let Joker live?) and is capital I important.  — DaveCreators: Judd Winick, Joshua MiddletonIssues: Superman/Shazam #1-4The Man of Steel meets Earth’s Mightiest Mortal! Quite literally, as this acts as a first meeting between both Superman and Captain Marvel (Shazam) as well as Clark Kent and Billy Batson. It’s clear that this takes place very early in Billy Batson’s outings as Captain Marvel, he’s very unsure of himself as a person, but strives to be like his heroes, rushing into battle as though he’s been through this a million times. First Thunder sees Billy teaming up with Superman for the first time and really learning from him, while trying his hardest not to reveal his true identity, and importantly his age. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Gail Simone, Dale Eaglesham, Brad WalkerIssues: Secret Six #1 to #36Don’t tell anyone, but I actually like Secret Six more than Suicide Squad. Spinning out of the “Villains United” Infinite Crisis tie-in, Secret Six follows the likes of Catman, Deadshot, Bane, Ragdoll, Knockout and Scandal Savage as various jobs take them across the vastness of the DC Universe. Simone, Eaglesham and collaborators craft a sleek, smart, funny story of espionage and antihero-y tendencies that centers perfectly throughout 2000’s era DC Comics. Sometimes the villains of DC are more fun in theory than in story, but in Secret Six they’re all the absolute most fun they can be on the page. This book will make you like Catman and get genuinely offended by the assumptions that he’s a joke!  — DaveCreators: Christopher MoellerIssues: OGNChristopher Muller writes and illustrates a gorgeous graphic novel in which Wonder Woman learns the Justice League is going to die to death at the hands of a Dragon, and then decides she has to defeat the entire league by herself to ultimately save their lives. And before fighting the Dragon by herself with her bare ass hands. It’s absolutely the kind of gloriously dumb concepts that can work in the right creator’s hands, and Moeller pulls it off. Plus, we get to see Batman take down the whole League every other Wednesday, which makes it all the more essential to see Diana operate on that same level, with that same strategy, and with even more power. — DaveCreators: Kurt Busiek, Stuart ImmonenIssues: Superman Secret Identity #1 to #4Part of DC’s Elseworlds imprint, what if you were named after the world’s most famous comic book Superhero? What if you also had to live in middle America, being constantly compared to said Superhero? Clark Kent puts up with this every day, though the constant mocking from his classmates don’t exactly make life any easier. However, when camping alone one night, Clark finds himself flying up in the air. His strength has increased, and he finds himself with abilities straight out of the comic books. While this could very well be a blessing, it brings with it paranoia, confusion, and worry. Superman: Secret Identity follows the young Clark Kent as he tries to live his life and understand the reasons behind his strange abilities. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Darwyn CookeIssues: The New Frontier #1-6Darwyn Cooke’s 2004 limited series is designed to place the old school heroism of DC heroes within the historical context that gave birth to them in the first place through a story that wonders what the world would be like if heroes such as Superman, Wonder Woman, and Green Lantern actually came into the world in the year of their comic book debut. By being primarily set in the ‘50s, Cooke’s art is perfectly complemented by period-accurate mid-century design and fashion while his story of the Silver Age of heroes reckons with the hope of John F. Kennedy’s “New Frontier” speech and the horror of racial injustice.“The New Frontier” encompasses a wide cast of characters, with each hero or team either being met with daring victories or tragic deaths as the United States tries to reckon with the Cold War abroad and injustices at home. What’s incredible about Cooke’s masterpiece is that it works just as well as an encapsulation of everything that makes DC Comics special as it does as one man’s attempt to grapple with everything that makes a nation both great and tragically flawed. Plus, there’s a giant floating alien dinosaur alien that gets blown up by The Flash running real fast. — Matt DraperCreators: Mark Millar, Dave Johnson, Killian PlunkettIssues: Superman: Red Son #1 to #3My literal favorite part about “Red Son” is Batman hopping around in his cute Russian winter hat, but admittedly the “What if Superman landed in Cold War Russia?” concept is a pretty strong hook too. “Red Son” definitely feels like Millar at his most restrained, channeling the energies of “Whatever Happened to The Man of Tomorrow?” rather than his darker trips into cynical depravity. It’s been long enough since I read it that I don’t know that this messaging holds up, but the general idea of Superman’s “American-ness” and the flukyness of that when you consider he crashed in a rocket on our planet is a really great entrypoint into understanding global humanity. The high concept is gorgeous if you let it be.  — DaveCreators: Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Dave Gibbons, Phil Jimenez, George Perez, variousIssues: Full Event/CrossoversI don’t necessarily love Infinite Crisis as a standalone seven issue event book, but when taken in tandem with the excellent over-sized “Countdown” and the various “Countdown” tie-ins that set the stage for things like Secret Six, Checkmate, and a whole bunch of 52, the holistic event is actually quite memorable. So when I say Infinite Crisis belongs on a list like this, I’m talking Omnibus sized, back breaking, can’t read this damn thing anywhere whole Infinite Crisis. Plus, you’ll never punch the mirrors of reality the same way again after reading this beast.– DaveCreators: Greg Rucka, Jesus SaizIssues: Checkmate #1 to #12After Infinite Crisis, the world turned against heroes, which perfectly set the stage for the super-secret spy agency Checkmate to return and pick up where teams like JLA fell. That political tension makes the book a taut thriller, almost like JLA’s own version of Gotham Central, except half “war on terror,” half “cold war.” By keeping fights to just the meaningful ones and cutting out other distractions, the book became more about characters outmaneuvering one another. The stakes aren’t just high, they’re argued until we understand all sides. And with that knowledge, the danger seems far more real than another monster or time-quake. Also, respect for basically reintroducing Alan Scott and Mr. Terrific. — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns, Greg Rucka, Keith Giffen, VariousIssues: 52 #1 to #52A weekly comic book bouncing around all corners of the DC Universe, from the minds of four celebrated writers at the peak of their powers, with Keith Giffen’s artistic vision centering everything…. there’s no way that would work, right? Against all odds, 52 tells a wide variety of compelling stories, from the Mad Scientist Island to Renee Montoya and Vic Sage’s journey to Booster Gold trying to figure out broken timelines. 52 is a remarkable follow up to Infinite Crisis, the rare moment in superhero comics where the fallout of an event actually gets dealt with in all kinds of meaningful ways instead of just moving on to the “next crisis.” Likewise, it’s thrilling to find a book at the center of DC that so expressly and purposefully pulls the familiar Justice League faces from the story’s center. The rest of the world gets to shine, and serves as a reminder why we fell for this universe in the first place. — DaveCreators: Geoff Johns, Black Lives Matter, Ivan Reis, Carlos Pacheco, VariousIssues: Green Lantern Rebirth #1-6, Green Lantern Corps Recharge #1-5, Green Lantern #1-25, Green Lantern Corps #14-18, Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1, Green Lantern Secret Files 2005 #1, Tales of the Sinestro Corps: Superman Prime #1 and Green Lantern/Sinestro Corps Secret Files #12020 me realizes it sure as hell isn’t “cool” for Hal Jordan to be your favorite Green Lantern, but getting into DC Comics for the first time and watching Hal conquer fear with nothing but a Han Solo attitude and willpower sure left a mark. I have an increasingly difficult time enjoying the work of Geoff Johns, but perhaps so much of it is I’m chasing the highs of Green Lantern and just know I won’t reasonably ever get back there. From the course correction of 90’s era Hal into a modern rejuvenation of the corps to the build-up of the Sinestro Corps War and the Yellow Lantern leader finally feeling like a DC supervillain worthy of a spot on the Legion of Doom, this era of Green Lantern became the center of the DC Universe until the New 52.  — DaveCreators: Keith Giffen, Cully HammerIssues: Blue Beetle #1 to #122000’s era DC Comics definitely becomes more resistant to legacy characters, which is unfortunate because it’s consistently one of the shared universe’s biggest advantages. Nonetheless, there are bright spots in the grand tradition, and the creation of Jamie Reyes as the new Blue Beetle following the events of Countdown to Infinite Crisis is a personal highlight. — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, JH Williams III, Simone Bianchi, Doug Mahnke, VariousIssues: Full Event/CrossoversWhat does a ‘Team Book’ where none of the members ever actually meet look like? Can something like that even be done? Is that even possible? Can you tell a sweeping, massive narrative with a team of characters, and pull that off? That’s at the crux of Seven Soldiers, as is the idea of taking the iconic NYC, the hub of Marvel, and asking what it looks like in the DC world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proto-Multiversity, and the prelude to Final Crisis, Seven Soldiers is Morrison’s triumphant DC return, with him at his most experimental and bold, let loose from tradition to pursue and revamp a diverse array of ideas and characters in radically distinct comics. And joining him are some of the best artists in comics, from your J. H Williams’ to Doug Mahnkes, they’re all here. And they’re all doing interesting structural, and narrative experiments, laying out an intricate macro-structure that is still wildly idiosyncratic. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Geoff Johns, Richard Donner, Adam KubertIssues: Action Comics #844-846, #851, 866-870, And Action Comics Annual #11A lot of times when big nerd culture celebrities are brought in to work on a comics project it’s 9/10ths marketing, but in the case of Superman Director Richard Donner listed as co-writer alongside Geoff Johns, the work is very strong, and decidedly in sync with Donner’s celebrated vision. — DaveCreators: Geoff Johns, Gary FrankIssues: Superman: Secret Origin #1-6Before they were Doomsdaying all over DC’s precious Watchmen license, Geoff Johns and Gary Frank were telling some actually solid Superman stories in the format of the “Secret Origin” flashbacks. — DaveCreators: Paul Dini, Guillem MarchIssues: Gotham City Sirens #1 to #26Paul Dini’s certainly best known for his incredible role shepherding Batman: The Animated Series, but his DC Comics work is no slouch, and there’s little I enjoy more than Gotham City Sirens. Circling the space between Birds of Prey and Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey, “Sirens” is a team-up book between Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn. It’s a perfect and needed tonal interjection into the dour heart of Gotham, sexy, funny and unpredictable. I don’t know that it starts here, but the rise of Harley Quinn as a cultural force certainly has strong roots in this work, expanded upon in everything from the Birds of Prey movie to the absolutely excellent Harley Quinn animated series.  — DaveCreators: Grant Morrison, Andy Kubert, JH Williams III, Frank Quitely, JG Jones, VariousIssues: See the reading order!What happens when you give the keys to the Batman kingdom to famed Scottish writer, Grant Morrison? A man who tends to focus heavily on the metaphysical and the idea of the metanarrative. You get DCs Silver Age reborn in the 2000s. The Morrison era of Batman begins with the introduction of Damian Wayne, Batman’s estranged son, before jumping headfirst down a rabbit whole involving The Batman of Zurr-En-Arh, and a journey through time, post Final Crisis. Morrison’s run on Batman truly challenges what it means to be Batman or a member of the Batman Family. Roles change hands when needed, as characters define what it means to live up to expectations, and take on the responsibility of the Bat to the world. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Bryan Miller, Lee GarbettIssues: Batgirl #1 to #24Ask comic book fans to name members of the Bat family and you’ll get a wide variety of answers, but it’s certainly going to be a shock when the few, the proud, the Miller/Garbett Batgirl fans drop Stephanie Brown into the conversation.  — DaveCreators: Scott Snyder, Jock, Francesco FrancavillaIssues: Detective Comics #871-881Lovecraft’s Arkham was home to the disfigured, the cruel, the obscenely rich, and other forms of the criminally insane. It’s inspiration is clear on Gotham, which could easily be described as an open-air asylum. Or a psychologist’s maze. Black Mirror uses a city without Bruce Wayne to give fresh evidence of this. Dick Grayson takes on the mantle, leaving Jim Gordon to be the old soldier creating a split story. We feel Grayson’s vertigo from seeing how Gotham reveals its true nature only to Batman. And we dread beside Gordon as he waits, never knowing when the next tragedy will drop but certain that, whatever comes, it will target his cursed family. And when the streets run red, both men must learn a single lesson: the worst fear is not the unknown, but the intimately familiar revealed as a lie.  — John GalatiCreators: Grant Morrison, Yannick Paquette, Chris BurnhamIssues: Batman Incorporated #1-8 & Batman Incorporated: Leviathan Strikes! #1“Batman, Inc.” serves as the third act of Grant Morrison’s time on Batman that spanned from 2006 through 2013 and by taking place after the author had established his larger-than-life Bat-God take on the character, it has the opportunity to be larger and more outlandish than ever. Here, after returning from a purgatorial trip through time and space (just go with it), Bruce Wayne decides that the only way to change the world is to go international and team up with the many heroes inspired by him over the years. While volume 1 acts as a series of mini-arcs that push Batman into new territories, volume 2 serves as the tragic culmination of everything that came before.Morrison is an expert when it comes to playing with a character that will ultimately have to go on after he’s done on the title. And here, the author, teamed with the meaty, bone-breaking art of Chris Burnham, uses the inherent necessity of putting Batman back in the toybox for the next writer as a source of tragedy. Batman is eternal, the ouroboros forever eating its own tail in pursuit of justice that can never be fully attained because this character needs to keep fighting to sell comic books. That can be a source of inspiration for readers, but what does it mean for a son who is suddenly far more mortal than his godlike father? These questions make “Batman, Inc.” into an exploration of both the unlimited potential and tragic limitations of The Dark Knight. — Matt DraperCreators: Greg Rucka, JH Williams IIIIssues: Detective Comics #854-860Yes, the Grant Morrison written era of Batman (and related titles) was thrilling for a wide, wide variety of reasons, but one of the biggest hooks was how it opened doors across the whole line, such as creating a space for Kate Kane, the new Batwoman, to take over Detective Comics in the hands of Greg Rucka and JH Williams III. Rucka is obviously a formidable talent in comics, one of the most consistent creators in the medium, but JH Williams III’s stunning layout after layout is what makes “Elegy” stand tall with the all time greats. Factor in Kate Kane’s queer sexual orientation, an absolute rarity in the DC Universe, and this salvo in Batwoman is absolutely essential to the history of comics. — DaveCreators: Jeff Lemire, Travel Foreman, Steve PughIssues: Animal Man #1 to #29Creators: Scott Snyder, Yanick PaquetteIssues: Swamp Thing #1 to #18Over at Marvel, they have established a unique aesthetic that’s come to be known as Cosmic Marvel, collecting a group of characters and concepts under something of a unified banner. I propose DC has done something similarly unique with the work of Scott Snyder and Jeff Lemire on Swamp Thing and Animal Man, respectively. Building on the work of the Alan Moore written run of Swamp Thing, they have made concrete the building blocks of life with The Green and The Red: real, physical spaces governing the push and pull of natural forces (along with The Rot, always a danger but a necessary evil). These two series weave together the rich histories of the characters of Alec Holland and Buddy Baker into something vibrant and fresh, a mythology that is singular to DC. And while Snyder and Lemire are masterful storytellers, these worlds would not linger in the mind without the horrifying, gruesome art by Travel Foreman and Yanick Pasquette (for Swamp Thing and Animal Man, respectively). I can’t imagine using the description “beautiful body horror” before seeing Foreman’s creations, but his visceral (and I mean that literally) vision of The Rot has to be seen to be believed. — Zack DeaneCreators: Brian Azzarello, Cliff ChiangIssues: Wonder Woman #1 to #36Coming into ongoing DC Comics fresh as a daisy with DC’s New 52, Wonder Woman by Azzarello and Chiang was exactly what I needed to sell me on the character. Or perhaps more accurately, to sell me on the world of the character. In particular, Chiang’s designs of old fashioned Greek mythology inside the superhero landscape of the DC Universe was thrilling, whether talking about the dripping candle wax of Hades’ head or the Donkey Kong 64 water level boss proportions of Poseidon. In retrospect I don’t know how much this era of Wonder Woman really does for Diana (certain elements, like her true father, leave an increasingly sour taste), but it certainly sold me on a style I wasn’t finding almost anywhere else in the New 52. — DaveCreators: Scott Snyder, Greg CapulloIssues: Batman #1 to #52It may be lost to history, but when the New 52 started, it was Detective Comics – not Batman – that made all the headlines. That’s the book that gave up the longest running serialized issue count, and to top that, featured the Joker cutting off his own face in the first issue (which, lol)! Of course by the time Court of Owls was over, it was quickly evident that not only was Batman the superior book, but the creative team-up of Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo was going to turn some damn heads.   — DaveCreators: Peter Tomasi, Patrick Gleason, Andy KubertIssues: Batman and Robin #1 to #40, AnnualsBatman has had several partners in his journey to fight crime, however the challenge of working\n",

Splice together Morrison Batman and Ellisian espionage of the Wildstorm world, and you get this beautiful, charming spy book. From Midnighters to Maxwell Lords to Katherine Kanes, there was no corner Grayson wasn’t willing to touch.It posited the bold question: What if Dick Grayson wasn’t a lesser Batman in a lesser Gotham, but was instead a big, bold, narratively important figure in the DCU that was genuinely his own man? It pit the man known for his openness and lack of secrecy in circumstances that demanded he act against those instincts. From character conflict, turmoil, twists, sprawling mythology and big ideas, this was an ambitious, forward-facing title that had it all. Yes, even Dick Grayson’s butt, as The Midnighter notes with a sly grin. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Becky Cloonan, Branden Fletcher, Karl Kerschl, variousIssues: Gotham Academy #1 to #17What happens when you mix together Harry Potter and Slice Of Manga and set it in the context of a grand superheroic shared universe? That’s the crux of this wonderful title by Cloonan, Fletcher, brought to life by the terrific talents of Karl Kerschl. What is it like to be a student in Gotham, where Batmen, Clayfaces, and Robins are all real? What ancient horrors and mysteries lurk in the shadows? Is that professor just weird or is it a supervillain in disguise? Oh no, does that guy I like hate me?! Gotham Academy was very much an accessible, lovely entrypoint not only into the DCU, but superhero comics at large, catering to a YA crowd, and offering a diversification of the work seen in Big Two.It ended, but its spirit endures. It was warm, smart, emotional, and full of joy. It’s a book you can share with everyone. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Steve Orlando, ACO, Stephen Mooney, Alec MorganIssues: Midnighter #1 to #12While DC’s New 52 era Wildstorm Universe integration is generally an all-caps BAD IDEA, the fact that it spawned the incredible Midnighter solo series written by Steve Orlando honestly kind of saves the whole thing (as does the Midnighter and Apollo mini that followed!). Midnighter can get cynically and incorrectly reduced to “Gay Batman,” so Orlando and team are committed to fully fleshing out the hyper-violent, hyper-powerful vigilante, with as much insight into his love life, home life, and personality as his missions that lead to him punching out his own eardrums to avoid sonic hypnosis. Orlando’s a master at crafting extremely masculine queer characters who defy lingering stereotypes, and Midnighter is a fantastic fit among his work on the subject.  — DaveCreators: Tom King, Barnaby BagendaIssues: Omega Men #1 to #12Post-9/11 Star Wars. That’s it. That’s pretty much all you really need to know about this book, apart from the fact that it’s actually good, and not messy like The Prequels. Playing Kyle Rayner as the American Interventionist, in the Space Middle East that is The Vega System, the entire text is informed by writer Tom King’s own experiences in Iraq, and ends up a critique of US Interventionism, the messiness of war, the cyclical nature of violence. Rooted in King’s fascination with Alan Moore and Watchmen, the work is a 9-panel grid text, mimicking many of the storytelling techniques, right down to the end quotes.A formalist revamp of The Omega Men, it works as both the first and last story of the team, boasting propaganda poster-esque covers to Encyclopedia Galactica entries. This is proper DC Cosmic, it’s hard sci-fi, it’s about what war really is and does. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Mark Russell, Ben CaldwellIssues: Prez #1 to #6Have you ever read satire so real and biting, you almost watched it come true just months later, almost akin to prophecy? That was Prez. Mark Russell is a well known name now, having risen up with Flintstones, which everyone’s aware of. But the reason Flintstones exists is because of this book. Prez was a reboot of an old Joe Simon (Captain America co-creator) concept, about a kid president. It was meant to be a 12-part serialized satire. It unfortunately died at 6. This led to Russell opting for a strict one-and-done condensed storytelling approach, given his work could die fast like this one, leading to Flintstones.But despite its fate, it remains a terribly funny, haunting, and alarmingly accurate look at an America controlled by cruel corporate overlords and murderous politicians with no values, as conservativism and idiocy reign about, and so much feels lost. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Grant Morrison, VariousIssues: The Multiversity #1 And 2, The Multiversity Guidebook #1 And Multiversity Issues: The Society Of Super-Heroes #1, The Just #1, Pax Americana #1, Thunderworld #1, Mastermen #1 And Ultra Comics #1Grant Morrison’s epic, high concept, cosmic finale at DC Comics. Brewing for over half a decade, The Multiversity hit like a thundering revelation. If the prior Final Crisis drew up the myth of a Fifth World, this book delivered. It’s him in full Kirby mode. It’s the man in his 50s, much like The King in the ’70s, having done it all, returning with one big, final maelstrom of ideas, one giant monument of additive mythology. This is The Fifth World, and the ultimate cap-stone to everything he’s done at DC, and in Big Two comics, with a murderous row of top talent.It spans DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Astro Cities, and every superhero world ever made, and goes on further to make some more, and pits them against the ultimate eternal threat. A tremendous display of his range as a writer, able to pull off everything from Wagernian tragedy to Watchmen formalism, it’s a multiversal trip you’re likely to remember. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Peter Tomasi, Patrick GleasonIssues: Superman #1 to #45Superman is often referred to as ‘your dad’s superhero’. He is a hero that stands for truth and justice and is genuinely a strong role model in any young readers life. Superman as written by Tomasi and Gleason makes this abundantly clear by seeing Clark Kent as a father, committed to his family with Lois Lane, and their 10-year-old son, Jon Kent. The series explores the idea of both what it means to be Superman, and what young superpowered Jon must keep in mind growing up. The stories ranged from small adventures of Jon learning to use his abilities, mixed in with grand epic scale Superman stories of old. — Mikayla LairdCreators: James Tynion IV, Eddy Barrows, Alvoaro MartinezIssues: Detective Comics #934 to #981One of the most stale Batman stories for me is exploring the loss of Bruce Wayne’s humanity as his hyper-fixation on his crusade against crime increases. We get it, Bruce, you’re more bat than man, it truly is the dark knight of your soul, blah blah blah. That is why James Tynion IV’s Detective Comics is such a breath of fresh air; it’s about more than just dealing with Batman’s past moral compromises and the chipping away of his soul, it’s about how a new generation of heroes build upon his legacy to surpass him. Batwoman, Red Robin, and Clayface (in an enthralling new role as a hero) grapple with respecting the man who became Gotham’s greatest hero while still realizing Gotham deserves better. Neither hagiography nor damnation of the Dark Knight, Tynion’s Detective Comics feels clear-eyed and bold in its appraisal of Batman. — Zack DeaneCreators: Christopher Priest, Carlo Pagulayan, Ed Benes, VariousIssues: Deathstroke #1 to #50As one of the very few DC Rebirth launches that actually stuck with a consistent creative team for the first four years of the era, Deathstroke has gone from “Best Book of the Year” praise to forgotten old favorite over the years. It was only three years ago that comics critics were hailing the incredible “Chicago” issue for its approach to tackling inner city gun violence. Did Deathstroke drop off that much in quality as it kept going, or did we all just take it for granted? — DaveCreators: Gene Luen Yang, Viktor Bogdanovic, Billy TanIssues: New Super-Man #1 to #19Gene Yang is brilliant. We know this. Gene Yang was screwed over badly on Superman by Eddie Berganza. We also know this. Thrown into terrible mandated crossovers on his first foray into corporate capes, Yang was given a raw deal. But then something happened. Jim Lee proposed he do a Chinese Superman. Not Chinese-American, but Chinese. Yang didn’t want to. He hated the idea. But then he thought about it.And then he did what Yang does: Make a brilliant comic. What you have is a devilishly clever, curious work that’s about cultural conversations, how one culture informs another, how superheroes and politics intersect, and where the Superman falls into it all. But even as it is all that, while being an accessible exploration of the central DC ideas in a Chinese context, it’s also one that mines deep continuity to take a look at yellow peril and other ugly parts of the publisher’s past, going right back to Detective Comics #1. It’s fun, it’s honest, it’s fresh, it’s insightful, it’s what Gene Yang does best. — Ritesh BabuCreators: Peter Tomasi, Jorge JimenezIssues: Super Sons #1 to #16What happens when you put Damian Wayne, the 13-year-old assassin son of Batman, with Jonathan Kent, the half-Kryptonian 10-year-old son of Superman? Super Sons teams up the kids of two of DCs greatest superheroes in adventures that are fun, energetic and embraces the youthful spirit of both characters. Missions often find the serious and commanding Damian frustrated by Jon’s happy demeanor, and superpowered approach to the problem. Super Sons was short lived, but extremely entertaining and one that brings a smile to the face of its readers. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Marguerite Bennett, Marguerite SauvageIssues: Bombshells #1 to #33Anyone who reads Big Two comics is familiar with the excitement of picking up a series with a compelling premise only to realize that the intriguing concept is the only noteworthy thing going for it, with no follow-through that takes the idea someplace great. Well, if you like the idea of reimagining the women of DC as 1940’s American propaganda posters (think Rosie the Riveter as a superhero), I’m pleased to say that DC Comics: Bombshells, written by Marguerite Bennett, takes that fun concept and spins it into a unique and riveting Elseworlds story. In this WWII yarn, Kate Kane is a League-Of-Their-Own style major league baseball star (Batwoman as Bat Woman, get it?), Catwoman is a femme fatale straight out of a spy noir film, and Supergirl is the Soviets’ secret weapon. With the right balance of winking fun and grounded storytelling, Bombshells is the promise of a great concept fulfilled.– Zack DeaneCreators: Gerard Way, Nick DeringtonIssues: Doom Patrol #1 to #12Creators: Cecil Castellucci, Marley ZarconeIssues: Shade the Change Girl #1 to #12For its all too brief lifespan, DC’s Young Animal imprint, curated by longtime My Chemical Romance frontman, the leader the Black Parade himself, Gerard Way, was an injection of weird, inventive, and stylish fresh air. Clearly inspired by Grant Morrison and turn of the 90’s Vertigo Comics, Young Animal got to make the DC Universe weird again, and more often than not it succeeded. My two favorite successes from the era find Way and the incredible Nick Derington doing Morrison’s Doom Patrol justice (and then some), building off the inspirations to modernize and celebrate the wonderful legacy of the team. Cecil Castellucci and Marley Zarcone have more challenging hills to climb, recontextualizing the Shade the Changing Man franchise from Peter Milligan and Chris Bachalo. Shade the Changing Girl becomes a fever dream meta exploration of everything from bullying to mental health. Rest in Power Young Animal.  — DaveCreators: Tom Taylor, Bruno Redondo, Mike Miller, VariousIssues: Injustice Gods Among Us Year One – Year FiveListen, not every comic can be as formally creative as Watchmen or thematically dense as Mister Miracle. And not every comic has to be! Sometimes there’s a simple joy in reading about a simple Elseworlds story done well, like“What if the Justice League was set in feudal Japan?” or “What if Batman teamed up with Houdini to fight vampires?”. Injustice: Gods Among Us asks the simple question, “If Superman was going to turn bad and conquer the Earth, how would that happen?” and follows through with that idea to its natural conclusions. Tom Taylor, tasked with the unenviable job of writing a digital comic based off of a Mortal Kombat style fighting game, crafted something vital enough that, 7 years later, I suspect the legacy of Injustice will be in the (still-ongoing) comic adaptation and not the games. — Zack DeaneCreators: Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, VariousIssues: Full Event/CrossoversOne of my 3 favorite Big 2 comic book events, definitely behind 2015’s Secret Wars, but giving my Age of Apocalypse nostalgia everything it can handle. Snyder and Capullo’s Metal (originally supposed to be called ‘Dark Crisis,’ and make no mistake, it fits well within DC’s Crisis narrative) is a victory lap following their celebrated New 52 Batman run. The event is equal parts dense (a degree in Morrison-ology and the Hawkman mythos are among the DC comics knowledge base that go a long way!), and chalk full of “ROCK ON” action that any comic reader can fist pump about (*ahem* Joker Dragons *ahem*). Plus, the full event reading order is way tighter than most sprawling crossovers! — DaveCreators: Tom King, Mitch GeradsIssues: Mister Miracle #1 to #12A stone cold classic from top to bottom. A comic that deserves, in 20 years time, to be so ubiquitously considered a masterpiece that jaded comic fans will roll their eyes at how obvious a choice it is for their favorite comic blog’s “Top Five Superhero Comics” list (realheads know this hidden gem called Watchmen is where it’s really at). Tom King and Mitch Gerads effortlessly weave a tale that encapsulates PTSD and depression, the banality and horrors of war, and the simple, everyday beauty of marriage. Rooted in the New Gods mythos Jack Kirby built in the 70s, Mister Miracle simultaneously taps into the legacy of the medium of comic books (my god, the nine panel grid usage here!) while still always showcasing King and Gerards’ singular style. This is a comic that demands to be read carefully, then read again, and then again. — Zack DeaneCreators: Grant Morrison, Liam Sharpe, Tom OrzechowskiIssues: The Green Lantern #1 to #12, Blackstars #1 to #3, The Green Lantern Season Two #1 to #12I’ve cooled a bit on season two, but season one sure got John and I excited!— DaveCreators: Gene Luen Yang, GurihiruIssues: Superman Smashes the Klan #1 to #3A story dating back to the 1940s but retold and strengthened as its message radiates just as much now as it did then. Superman is pitted against the Klan of the Fiery Cross, as a Chinese American family move to Metropolis and find themselves the subjects of racial attacks. The children of the family find themselves the most heavily effected, and work with Superman to begin to understand the reasoning behind the attacks, and possibly save another child from falling into that mindset. The story ties the ideas of alienation to both the children, as well as Clark’s own feelings about himself. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Kurt Busiek, John Paul LeonIssues: Batman: Creature of the Night #1 to #4Young Bruce Wainwright is obsessed with Batman, especially due to the similarity to his own name. Bruce begins to find as many connections he can, even taking joy in the fact that he has an Uncle Alfred. It’s all fun and games, until his parents are murdered in a robbery gone wrong. Now young Bruce is on his own in the world, granted, he is supported by his reasonably large inheritance. But he can’t shake the feeling that it’s all part of a conspiracy, which is only strengthened when a Bat like creature begins to appear to Bruce. — Mikayla LairdCreators: Brian Michael Bendis, Nick DeringtonIssues: Batman: Universe #1 to #6What do you get when you force Brian Michael Bendis to ditch his decompression and force him to compress story into 12-pagers? Some of the best, most tight work of his career that boasts everything you love about the iconic writer. With artist extraordinaire Nick Derington as his partner, Bendis builds his own, personal vision of Batman, which disposes of dull attempts at ‘realism’ and ‘seriousness’, and instead opts for a high-energy operatic adventure, a Brave and the Bold-style voyage across the great canvas of the DC Universe.It’s accessible, it’s fun, it’s filled to the brim with everything you love about superhero universes and comics, from gimmicky-criminals, western gunslingers to crazy cosmic beings. A travelogue that lets Derington cut loose and put together the tapestry of the DCU for both old readers and new alike, it’s a trip that’s more about the journey than the destination. It’s not about plot, but it is about great moments. — Ritesh BabuCreators: NK Jemesin, Jamal CampbellIssues: Far Sector #1 to #12If you told me in early 2019 that DC was going to introduce another Green Lantern in their own solo book (and not only another Green Lantern, another human Green Lantern), I can’t imagine being less curious. But when it was revealed that three-time Hugo award winning sci-fi author N.K. Jemisin was writing this new 12 issue maxi-series for DC’s Young Animal imprint, my ears perked up. And the series did not disappoint. A self-contained story of murder and social upheaval on a faraway world, Far Sector allows Jemisin to flex her worldbuilding muscles. With Jamal Campbell’s stunning art, The City Enduring is quickly established as a fascinating locale, both familiar and alien in its intricacies. And by the time you get a few issues into this series, the bold new Green Lantern, Sojourner “Jo” Mullein, might just have you saying “Hal who?” — Zack DeaneFiled Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Mark Belktron says February 18, 2022 at 10:47 amFantastic list. I agree with almost all your picks. I will post this on my DC in the 80’s account on Facebook.\n",
      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:00 amFirst off, I want ot say I love your page. Your reading orders have been essential for me since getting back to reading comics a couple of years back, after an absence of over 20 years! I’m glad to say i’ve read the vast majority of these comics, and agree they are fantastic comics. There are, however, some big omissions, namely, most of al, The Sandman.\n",
      "Its as influential and fantastic as a comic can be. If Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits makes the cut, despite being a Vertigo title, then so should Sandman. Books of Magic as well, while we are at it.Sandman is very explicitly within the larger super-hero DC universe, as Mr. Miracle, Dr. Destiny, The Scarecrow, Martian Manhunter feature on it, and even Batman appears in one panel, for example. Places like Arham Asylium are also featured in the series. My suggestion? Lump Batman Inc with Morrison’s Batman run (it belongs there anyway, as its a direct continuation of his previous Bartman work). This way, you have a empty spot to put The Sandman in. Come on, you know it deserves to be in this list.\n",
      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:33 amOh, and I’d lump The Black Mirror with Batman by Scott Snyder, and replace it with Paul Dini’s Detective Comics and Streets of Gotham run, and call it Batman, by Paul Dini.\n",
      "Paul says March 24, 2021 at 2:11 amI think Greg Rucka’s Wonder Woman run is issues #195-226 if I’m not mistaken.\n",
      "Cyril says October 31, 2020 at 10:06 pmSeeing Mad Love in the list I can’t help to suggest Harleen by Stjepan Sejic. Aside from the godlike art, it elevates Mad Love to a psyche study of Harleen Quinzel. Did I mention the awesome art?\n",
      "Ryan says September 3, 2020 at 1:49 amA really fantastic list that I have only one problem with: There’s a few stories on this list that could have been listed together in order to free up an extra spot.  I’m thinking Batman Inc. could have been added to Morrison’s Batman and The Black Mirror could have gone with Batman by Snyder. I’d have to go through the list again but I think there is at least one other instance of something like this.  Now I have no idea what you would add instead though.  Anyways, this list is going to be great to go through. Its been about 5 years since you did the Marvel one so I’d love to see an update.  Also, I’d love to see another company or imprint as well.  Thank you!\n",
      "Hugo Melo says February 18, 2022 at 9:04 amAgree with that notion. Batan Inc could be included in the Morrison run, and Black Mirror on Snyder’s.I’d replace the Batman Inc spot with The Sandman, and the Black Mirror spot with either The Books of Magic, Hellblazer: All His Engines or Family Man, or Tynion’s Justice League Dark myself.Your email address will not be published.

The earned respect and praise of DC Rebirth carried through much of a year that saw the best event in superhero comics (Metal) and easily the year’s most respected “superhero” title in Mister Miracle.Simply put, there are a number of worthy options for a top 5 DC Comics of the year list, and it’s a testament to the continued success of the line. Marvel may play the numbers game well enough to stave off financial ruin, but ask any Wednesday warrior who’s winning the Big 2 battle right now, and it’s DC.Below you’ll find my favorite DC Comics of 2017. Each of these series continues into 2018, meaning there’s still time to add it to your pull list.In most cases, you can find DC Rebirth or Young Animal trades also available on Hoopla. I highly recommend giving the service a look if you’re interested in catching up on any of the select titles.There isn’t a single Young Animal title that isn’t at least interesting (you’ll find plenty of fans upset this slot didn’t go to Shade, The Changing Girl), but it’s so easy to imagine a parallel universe where Doom Patrol went horribly wrong. After all, a famous rock star trying to capture the idiosyncrasies and madcap vision of Grant Morrison on DC’s weirdest team? This could have gotten ugly quickly.Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

I’m deliriously excited for the Doom Patrol / Justice League crossover “Milk Wars” in early 2018, and you can too! I’ve loved every minute of DC’s Kamandi Challenge, and honestly, prior to this I hadn’t read a page of Jack Kirby’s Kamandi, the Last Boy on Earth in my life.To celebrate what would have been the King’s 100th birthday, DC announced a twelve issue limited series, with a variety of renowned creators taking the “Kamandi Challenge.” Essentially each creative team writes a Kamandi story, then leaves an impossible cliffhanger for the next creative team to try and solve. It’s a really fun process and look inside the craft of excellent writers and artists like Neal Adams, Walt Simonson, and Marguerite Bennett (among many others).It would seem like a no-brainer to include Superman on a year-end DC Comics list, but it’s actually been a long time coming since the Man of Steel could reasonably be placed among the DC Universe’s best. The reintroduction of Superman’s family with DC Rebirth has immensely helped the character, and Clark, Lois, and son Jon form one of the most compelling families in comics.Likewise, Superman has finally been restored to one of the titles in the driver’s seat of the DC Universe, with stories like “Superman: Reborn” driving the entire DCU straight to Doomsday Clock.Superhero comics are so chalk full of events now (thanks Marvel!) you’d be forgiven if yet another escaped your interest. In the case of Dark Nights: Metal, you’d be missing out on the best Crisis-level event of the decade. The New 52 Batman creative team of Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo is back together for their most cosmic, adrenaline-infused Batman story yet, a Bat-centric event with the entire multiverse at stake.Perhaps the best aspect of Metal is that it’s a tightly crafted story with only limited tie-ins. Better, most of the tie-ins are one-shots unique to the story, and don’t interrupt previous ongoings. The titles that are interrupted for Metal flow organically, and only for a single issue at a time.I’m not exaggerating when I say Metal is the most passionate I’ve been about a comic book series since Secret Wars (2015). This isn’t quite that good (yet) but I’m filled with joy every time a new issue hits the stands.This is intentional hyperbole: Tom King is fast reaching Alan Moore status. King brings a level of sophistication and brilliance to each and every comic book series he writes that is typically unheard of in comics. Through works such as Vision, Sheriff of Babylon, and Omega Men, King has established himself as a can’t miss comic book author.Even though King is writing DC’s Batman (a series that has reached new highs toward the close of 2017), it’s his twelve issue limited series, Mister Miracle, with artist Mitch Gerads that is defying all expectations of what a superhero comic book can and should be. Mister Miracle is the kind of comic that makes you want to read, make, and talk about comics in a crazed rush of ambition to make everything this damn good.Mister Miracle won’t be for every reader. It’s a strange book, without any sort of traditional superhero structure, and I’d argue a love of Jack Kirby’s New Gods is largely essential for enjoyment. Nonetheless, this isn’t just my favorite DC comic of 2017, it’s my pick for comic of the year.Doomsday ClockBatman White KnightDeathstrokeBug!The Wildstorm What do you think?

      "Kyle says December 21, 2017 at 10:59 pmI very much respect your opinion and will be checking out a few of these. However, after feeling swamped by marvel and not connecting to where a lot of my favorite characters are going I (gasp) picked up a DC Rebirth trade Batman(Tom King). It has been fantastic and brought back my excitement with comics. This coming from a mainly Marvel fan boy. I can attest to Tom Kings Batman and really want to check out some of his other stuff. I have branched out quite a lot into DC Rebirth but have kinda side stepped Superman. Are all of the titles that good? Or, is it just the main book?\n",
      "Dave says December 22, 2017 at 10:27 amHonestly, if I had made this list a week later, Batman would be right at the top. I’m generally positive about the run, but the last three issues have been extraordinary. Batman Annual #2 is one of my favorite single comics of the year (and of the past several years). It’s fantastic 🙂I like Superman and Action Comics. I am not caught up on Super Sons or New Superman. Rebirth has had a very high level of consistency across the board, so I recommend checking out as much as you can and sticking with what works.\n",
      "Taylor Carr says December 24, 2017 at 8:12 pmI agree that DC Rebirth is excellent overall and way ahead of Marvel right now. I started off with comics by reading Marvel (thanks to help from your guide, starting at ANAD Marvel). The Marvel is 90+% mediocre to me, even as such a new reader. I’ve dropped the majority of the series I’ve started from them in the past few years. I still enjoy the Star Wars comics and try the 1st issue of all their new series, but I really wish it would get better. I’m cautiously optimistic for when Legacy comes to Marvel Unlimited.DC Rebirth is a different story. I am voraciously obsessed with getting into this universe. I’ve read all completed events besides Superman Reborn and Titans Lazarus Contract. I’m also trying to read the first volume of every series and only have a few left. DC Metal looks amazing and I can’t wait to start that.Anyway, happy holidays to you and thanks for everything you do on this site! Most of what I know about comics now is thanks to you!\n",

      "Apocalypse Reading Order Best Tablet For Digital Comics  Is Marvel Unlimited Worth It? Copyright © 2022 · Metro Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log inscreenrant.com10 Best DC Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerDC Comics has a vast pantheon of iconic superheroes, and these are the top 10 voted characters at Ranker.Being one of the big two comic book publishers, DC Comics has established a vast and varied pantheon of superheroes over the decades. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman have long since been their flagship heroes known as \"The Trinity,\" but others have made their way into the mainstream to become favorites in their own right.RELATED: 10 Best Monsters In DC Comics, RankedComic books and comic book-based media have skyrocketed in popularity in more recent years, which, in large part, helped these characters gain bigger exposure and fan bases. The voting community of Ranker compiled a list of their 10 most popular heroes made up of long-time favorites and underdog characters.DC's Shazam has gradually been gaining traction in the mainstream thanks to the Shazam! movie, where costume designers created one of the DCEU's best suits. His alter ego Billy Batson is a child, but gains the ability to turn into the superhero Shazam as a grown metahuman. The superhero is a testament to what simpler, more lighthearted characters and stories can bring to the table in a resonant way.Shazam's premise is a refreshing change of pace from the dark and gritty, giving a cheerful and interesting dynamic of a \"Superman\" that's ultimately still going through the literal growing pains of a kid. All the while he's still handling the responsibilities and level of power on a similar scale to Superman.The early goings of the Arrow TV series helped bolster Green Arrow's popularity, but he's been respectably well-known in DC's comics. Similar to Bruce Wayne, Oliver Queen is a rich philanthropist who used his identity to masquerade the Robin Hood-like persona of Green Arrow.But he grew to be a compelling character in his own right away from being an alternate Batman character. One of his most iconic comic book arcs is as a duo with Green Lantern. The premise of the story, and the background of the two superheroes' respective worldviews, made for thought-provoking social commentary.Undeservedly so, Aquaman was often on the wrong side of many jokes within superhero fanbases. The misconceptions didn't do the hero justice in making people realize how valuable he is to the Justice League.RELATED: 10 Best Friendships In DC ComicsMore modern-age comics started fixing the misunderstandings surrounding the character, telling interesting stories displaying Aquaman's true power and tackling issues like finding a sense of belonging. He's a perfect character for the latter basis, as he's someone caught between two different worlds and communities while feeling responsibility toward both.One of DC's dark-horse superheroes that deserves more recognition is Martian Manhunter. The underrated powerhouse character started getting more attention partly thanks to the excellent Justice League and Justice League Unlimited DCAU animated shows.The shape-shifting martian serves as a compassionate intergalactic crime fighter and is often depicted as the Justice League's empathetic heart and soul. In terms of live-action, the most fans have gotten was the tease in Zack Snyder's Justice League. With the potential the character has, many fans undoubtedly hope that he makes a return to add to the DCEU's diverse cast of heroes.The Hal Jordan iteration is arguably the most conventionally used version by DC Comics. He's one of the three most iconic incarnations of Green Lantern alongside Alan Scott and John Stewart. One of the narrative benefits of the Green Lantern persona is how varied different versions can be, as the Green Lantern Corp. is an intergalactic peacekeeping force filled with them.RELATED: 10 DC Comics Events, Ranked By ImportanceIt makes the possibilities endless on what kinds of characters to explore. Hal Jordan has provided some memorable stories, though, with his aforementioned ideological character study with Green Arrow as a highlight.  The perspectives the two gain make for one of DC's hallmark friendships.One of the most iconic superheroes in general, Wonder Woman earns her title as one of \"The Trinity.\" Along with Superman and Batman, the Princess of Themyscira is one of the core pillars and founding members of the Justice League. Wonder Woman's demonstrated incredible feats of power, devotion to her convictions, but also shows human compassion.The superhero is also partly responsible for breaking tired genre tropes of the \"damsel in distress,\" while bringing to life colorful, sweeping stories involving Greek mythology and the different eras of humanity. The latter of which in part told through her involvement with the Justice Society.Barry Allen is the most synonymous character to the Flash persona and is also a mainstay in the DC Universe's most important events. The Flash is often the superhero first to come into fans' minds when thinking of superspeed. He was even one of the main superhero characters responsible for DC's successful revitalization of the genre, taking it into the Silver Age of comics.The \"Fastest Man Alive\" is a great and pivotal character for exploring the multiverse concept. Undoubtedly the most noteworthy story arc of the Flash is his Flashpoint crossover that presented wide-spreading ramifications for DC's multiverse.Dick Grayson established the Dynamic Duo with Bruce Wayne's Batman and has proven to be one of the most beloved and important Bat-family characters. After falling and growing out of being a sidekick superhero, Dick stretched out and made an identity of his own in the form of Nightwing.RELATED: 10 Most Iconic Harley Quinn Panels In DC ComicsHis charismatic, kindhearted, and empathetic nature made for an excellent emotional anchor for his adoptive father and being a fan-favorite on his own merits. Bruce himself has said that Dick Grayson represents a purer form of Batman is meant to be. Fans generally seem to agree, believing that he's the one person most suitable for inheriting the Batman mantle.The Son of Krypton is one of the most famous characters that's become synonymous with the word \"superhero\" in general. Clark Kent's story as Superman is a timeless one of how good humanity can collectively be. It's also a celebration of embracing people of all walks of life, as despite being a Kryptonian, Superman represents the purest form of what it means to be human as a true \"Man of Tomorrow.\"He's the embodiment of what people should strive to be, while still being a compelling character that suffers and triumphs through his trials and flaws. Superman also completes a great friendship and dynamic with Batman in the comics, which is often the central focus in titles such as World's Finest and events like Kingdom Come.Unsurprisingly, the Dark Knight himself endures as DC's most loved superhero. Batman is second in popularity only to Marvel's Spider-Man, with the former making up some of the comic book medium's most acclaimed comics. His high benchmark of quality ranges from having some of the best rogues galleries of DC villains to gripping psychological and crime-noir stories.In his best arcs, Batman's stories represent exceptional cases of exploring the traumatized flaws of the psyche, as well as how someone can take moments of excruciating emotional pain and forge them into an indomitable force for good and redemption. That even in periods of overbearing darkness, there's always a path back. Redemption is another timeless message because it has to be if humanity is to persevere.NEXT: 10 Most Iconic Batman Comic Panels, RankedGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he now resides in Houston. He is a fan of pretty much anything involving nerd culture. Video games, comics, movies, TV, anime, manga, you name it. He also has experience writing about soccer, specifically, the German team Bayern Munich.The Best DC Comics Heroes  The DC Universe boasts some of the most popular characters and heroes of any popular media in the world, but with over 10,000 characters in the mix, who are the best among them? Here’s our list of the top characters in DC’s expansive catalog.Superman is possibly the most powerful being in the DC Universe. First appearing in Action Comics #1 in 1938, Kal El is an alien from the planet Krypton. His parents launched him into space as their planet exploded and he landed on earth where he was raised as a human, Clark Kent, and grew up to be a journalist for the Daily Planet.Early in his adulthood, Clark receives a message from his late father and learns of his Kryptonian abilities, which have been enhanced thanks to the abundance of sunlight available on Earth. Clark can fly, lift massive objects with his super strength, deflect bullets with his own body, and even shoot lasers out of his eyes. Superman is a founding member of the Justice League and is powerful enough that Batman creates contingency plans in case the Man of Steel ever goes rogue.Bruce Wayne doesn’t have any superpowers, but thanks to his exceptional intellect and vast wealth, that’s never stopped him from being one of the greatest heroes in the DC Universe. After the murder of his parents when Wayne was a young boy, Wayne dedicates his life to fighting criminals and trains physically and mentally to become Batman.Batman first appeared in 1939 with the 27th issue of Detective Comics. He’s a founding member of the Justice League and has gone toe to toe with some of the best villains DC has to offer, including the Joker, Deathstroke, Bane, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and many more.Robin is Batman’s trusty sidekick and several characters have taken on the role including Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Tim Drake. The Boy Wonder’s first appearance was in Detective Comics #38 in 1940 and he has been a trusty companion to Batman ever since.The first Robin, Dick Grayson eventually goes on to become Nightwing and Jason Todd, the second Robin, becomes an antagonist known as The Red Hood, after his apparent murder at the hands of the Joker. More recently, Batman chose his own son, Damian Wayne, to become the fourth iteration of the character during the 2009 Battle for the Cowl storyline.Nightwing is the persona Dick Grayson takes on after leaving the role of Robin, but the character’s origin actually comes from the Superman storyline in which the Man of Steel takes on the name of Nightwing as he protects the planet Kandor alongside his friend Flamebird or Jimmy Olsen. Dick Grayson decides to take up the original Nightwing’s mantle after drawing inspiration from the legendary Kryptonian vigilante.Drawing on his experiences as an acrobat and the Boy Wonder, Grayson uses a high-tech suit and gadgets to patrol Gotham, most notably, his pair of eskrima clubs which can act as grappling hooks or even line guns as well as melee weapons.Princess Diana of Themyscira or Diana Prince when she’s blending in with humans is Wonder Woman, and she made her debut in All Star Comics #8  in 1941. Wonder Woman is a founding member of the Justice League and is known for her heritage as an Amazonian warrior. She uses an array of magical objects she uses to fight crime, including the Lasso of Truth, indestructible bracelets, a projectile tiara, and her invisible jet.Wonder Woman is also descended from Zeus and thus possesses godlike powers like immortality and the ability to fly. The character draws inspiration from early feminism and is perhaps the most popular female hero in the entirety of the DC Universe.Green Lantern is a name several characters in the DC Universe have taken on, with the first being Alan Scott in All-American Comics #16 in 1940. Originally wielding a magical ring crafted from a magical lamp, the Green Lantern alias was later reimagined as a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a kind of cosmic police force.The Green Lantern’s powerful rings allow them to manifest almost any object they can imagine into reality and control it using their mind. Besides Alan Scott, other characters who have taken turns as The Green Lantern include Hal Jordan, John Stewart, and Jessica Cruz.Flash is the alter ego of at least four different characters throughout DC Universe history. True to the name, Flash can run faster than the speed of sound using the power of the “speed force.”The speed force is so powerful that it allows Flash to literally run through time.Jay Garrick was the original Flash and debuted in Flash Comics #1 in 1940, but Barry Allen, Barry’s nephew Wally West, and Barry’s grandson Bart Allen have all stepped into the role at different points. Flash has worked both as a member of the Justice League and Teen Titans and even competed in several races against Superman.Aquaman first appeared in More Fun Comics #73 in 1941 and is another founding member of the Justice League. The character is massively popular and remains one of the world’s most recognized superheroes to this day.Aquaman’s true name is Arthur Curry and he is the half-human, half-Atlantean king of Atlantis. He is capable of communicating telepathically with sea life as well as breathing underwater and he wields a three-pronged trident against his foes.Billy Batson is a young homeless boy who can transform into an adult superhero by speaking the word “Shazam.” Shazam can fly and possesses superhuman strength and speed. He first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 in 1940.Billy gains his abilities from a wizard who tells him he has fought evil for 3000 years using the powers of the gods Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury (SHAZAM), but is now too old to continue. Billy takes on the wizard’s responsibilities and regularly battles with the Monster Society of Evil. Shazam’s original name was Captain Marvel, but D.C. began to downplay that name in favor of Shazam after a copyright dispute with Marvel over their superhero of the same name.The Martian Manhunter is an original member of the Justice League. His real name is J’onn J’onzz and he and made his first appearance in Detective Comics #225 in 1955. J’onzz is a humanoid Martian with green skin and has several powers and abilities. He can change shape, turn invisible and speak to other beings telepathically in addition to his super strength and flying capabilities.J”onzz uses his shapeshifting abilities to disguise himself and better blend in with humans. He often takes on the persona of a detective named John Jones during the course of his adventures and he is among the most powerful members of the Justice League.Hawk Girl first appeared in Flash Comics #1 in 1940 and she is one of the first female superheroes to appear in DC comics. Many different versions of Hawkgirl have appeared since the heroine’s original debut with characters including Shiera Hall, Shayera Hol, and Kendra Saunders stepping into the role.Hawk Girl wears armor with a pair of artificial wings that allow her to fly and uses weapons out of medieval times like her mace. The character often appears alongside her male counterpart, Hawk Man.Garfield Mark Logan is Beast Boy and he’s capable of shapeshifting into any animal he sees be it in his everyday life or in a picture. He first appeared in The Doom Patrol #99 in 1965 and has worked as a member of both the Doom Patrol and the Teen Titans during his superhero career.Garfield gains his abilities after contracting a rare disease that only the West African Green Monkey is capable of surviving. Garfield’s father attempts an experimental procedure, turning Garfield into a green monkey for 24 hours in a desperate attempt to save his son’s life. While Garfield does indeed survive the virus, his father’s procedure has the unintended consequence of turning him green and bestowing him with his shapeshifting abilities for the rest of his life.Starfire is the alter ego of Princess Koriand’r of the planet Tamaran. SHe first appeared in DC Comics Presents #26 in 1980. Like Kryptonians, Starfire’s people derive their powers from solar energy. Starfire can fly and shoot blasts of ultraviolet energy called star bolts from her hands. She left her homeworld for Earth after a bitter feud with her sister, Blackfire, who attempted to enslave and then kill Starfire.Upon her arrival on Earth, Starfire meets Dick Grayson’s Robin and joins his team, the Teen Titans, which includes Beast Boy, Cyborg, and Raven. She even blends into human society using the alias Kory Anders to become a professional model when she isn’t thwarting evil with the Titans.Similar to Bruce Wayne, Oliver Queen is a playboy billionaire who moonlights as a costumed superhero. Queen’s alter ego, Green Arrow, first appeared in More Fun Comics #73 in 1941 and uses his incredible skill with a bow and arrow to patrol the streets of Star City and Seattle. In addition to his standard arrows, Green Arrow makes use of an array of specialty arrows like grapple, sticky, and explosive arrows to adapt to a range of situations.Green Arrow is sometimes associated with left-wing politics, at one point even losing his fortune to become a hero for the poor and working class. He has also fought alongside a number of other popular DC heroes including Black Canary and the Green Lantern as well as other members of The Justice League.Black Lightning made his debut in Black Lightning #1 in 1977 and was the first Black American superhero with his own series in the DC Universe. Jefferson Pierce is his real name and he was a top Olympic athlete before moving to Metropolis to be the principal of Garfield High School. He uses an advanced utility belt that gives him electric powers to clean up his neighborhood of Southside or “Suicide Slum” Metropolis.In later storylines, Pierce either internalizes the powers of his utility belt over time or he is reimagined as being born with the innate power to channel and control electricity with his body. At one point, Black Lightning teams up with the Justice League and is offered a position in the group before turning them down.Raven is the Cambion daughter of a human mother and demon father, Trigon, and goes by the name Rachel Roth when she wants to pose as a normal human. She’s a member of the Teen Titans and can sense emotions and control her soul separate from her physical body in addition to being proficient in the ways of magic.Raven came to the Justice League and asked them to help her defeat her father, Trigon, but they turned her down and she turned to the Teen Titans including Robin, Kid Flash, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Cyborg, eventually becoming a permanent member of the team.Victor Stone is Cyborg and he is the son of scientists who subject him to experiments to enhance his intelligence as a young boy. He first appeared in DC Comics Presents #26 in 1980. An interdimensional creature that emerges from one of his parents’ experiments kills Victor’s mother and critically injures him while he is visiting one of their labs.Victor’s father manages to save his son by implanting him with prosthetics all over his body, including the better part of his head. Victor is initially horrified and resentful of his father, but he eventually learns to harness his new body in the fight for justice, joining at different points with the Justice League and the Teen Titans.Nite Owl is one of the main heroes in the 1986 limited series Watchmen. Hollis Mason and Dan Dreiberg each take a turn as Nite Owl over the course of several decades and two generations of vigilantes. Mason joined the masked vigilante team, the Minutemen in 1939 before ultimately retiring in 1962 and passing on the mantle of Nite Owl to Dreiberg. In 1985, a street gang breaks into the retired Mason’s home and tragically murders him.Dreiberg also retires as Nite Owl for a time after President Nixon makes masked vigilantism illegal, but he steps back into the role after the murder of the Comedian, a former member of the Minutemen, and slowly uncovers a murderous plot to save the world with the help of other masked heroes like Silk Spectre and Rorschach.Silk Spectre is the superhero identity of the mother and daughter Sally Jupiter and Laurie Juspeczyk, and both appear in the original 1985 run of Watchmen. Sally was a member of the Minutemen and was an American sex symbol and superhero pin-up model during her career.Laurie serves as the Silk Spectre after her mother’s retirement and has romantic relationships with both Doctor Manhattan and Dan Dreiberg during her career. Laurie has a somewhat strained relationship with her mother, but as she uncovers the murder plot behind the Comedian’s death, she slowly unravels a dark secret about her mother’s past and her own lineage that turns her world upside down.There’s something wrong with Rorschach or Walter Kovacs, who is the only masked vigilante who remains active after Nixon makes vigilantism illegal. He’s antisocial and thinks like a conspiracy theorist based on his monologues and journals, but he might be onto something when he begins to investigate the murder of the Comedian with suspicion of a vast conspiracy to kill masked vigilantes.As deranged as the man might be, Rorschach drives the plot of Watchmen forward with his investigation, bringing his old team back together to solve the mystery. He’s most notable for his ever-morphing mask which changes into various shapes resembling the psychological Rorschach test.The 100+ Best DC Comics Heroes of All Time, According to FansDC Comics has a stable of great, iconic heroes on their roster, and while fans of Marvel would vehemently disagree – some of the best of all time.

The year began with the two month “Future State” timeline, before segueing into a wide variety of series relaunches and creative turnover in DC’s Infinite Frontier.The sheer amount of change makes this year a little more difficult than previous years in determining best ofs and entrance points, but honestly, it also makes for one of the most interesting lineups DC’s had in a few years.Below you’ll find the best DC Comics of 2021, updated throughout the year as new comics are released and I read new favorites!Best Comics of 2021Best Marvel Comics of 2021Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

When Tynion was announced as the next Batman writer after Tom King’s not-quite-100 issue run, it felt a bit like a tentative stopgap with one of DC’s most reliable regulars and disciple of DC mainstay Scott Snyder. Now, it’s clear it was a prescient passing of the torch to arguably the *best* writer of American comics in 2021.Since taking over Batman, Tynion has delivered “Something is Killing the Children,” “Department of Truth,” “Wynd,” “The Nice House on the Lake,” and the horror anthology “Razorblades” (with Steve Foxe). My full best of 2021 list basically requires a category *just* for his works. Oh, and not by accident, his post “Joker War” Batman has offered the best take on Gotham since *at least* the “Wedding of Batman and Catwoman.”For my money, the most fascinating thing about this era of Batman is Tynion’s willingness to truly create new characters for the shared universe. Given the history of publishers taking advantage of creators, there’s been a deliberate resistance to giving away the best ideas, but Tynion is in such an inventive space it hasn’t mattered. Whether or not you’re in love with Punchline, Clownhunter, Ghost-Maker and the like, the mainline title simply feels *fresh* in some thrilling ways.Yet, it’s Tynion’s work with Guillem March on “The Joker” that stands out to me as the best of the bunch. Post Joker War and Infinite Frontier #0, the clown prince of crime is the world’s most wanted criminal (even more so than usual), and former Gotham Police Commissioner Jim Gordon is put on the case to track him down. The noir-ish take on DC’s underbelly outside of Gotham is brilliant, tense, and gripping, as is the decision to predominantly focus on The Joker through the impact of his evil on the Gordon family.Speaking of Tynion, I can’t remember the last time a first issue had an approval rating as high as the first issue of the eight issue Black Label series, The Nice House on the Lake. It seems like every single critic I respect *adored* this series debut with a fervor I really don’t think I’ve seen since Tom King and Mitch Gerads on Mister Miracle. They’re not wrong either, as The Nice House on the Lake is a stylish reimagining of the apocalypse, with Alvaro Martinez joining Tynion’s The Department of Truth artist Martin Simmonds as yet another disciple of Bill Sienkiewicz blending the lines of comics and reality.My favorite DC Black Label launch of 2021 is Cliff Chiang’s vision of a future for Selina Kyle and Gotham City, inevitably seen as a response to Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns but with a flavor all its own. After long runs as the artist on works like New 52 Wonder Woman and Paper Girls, Chiang strikes back here doing nearly everything in “Lonely City,” writing, drawing and coloring the work.Between this and characteristically strong work from Ram V, it’s a good year to be a Catwoman fan.For more, check out my interview with Cliff Chiang!I have a confession: I don’t get Dan Watters and Dani’s Coffin Bound. I respect it, and I appreciate it, but I definitely do not get it. Which is a shame because I have it on good authority from my own insecurity that all the cool kids certainly love this Image Comics book!Fortunately, Watters and Dani team-up with the Coffin Bound team of Brad Simpson and Aditya Bidikar to tackle Gotham City in the wake of Joker’s assault on Arkham Asylum. All Batman’s most mentally unstable villains – at least those that didn’t die in the Joker’s attack – are now loose as Gotham descends into a new Arkham City.That? That I get.Watters and team approach the the familiarity of Batman’s rogues gallery through the lens of a Psychologist working with the GCPD, inviting comparisons to a Gotham Central that’s even more on the fringes, and with a much healthier dose of righteous 90’s nostalgia.The gap between the announcement of John Ridley’s perspective on the DCU and the actual oversized physical Black Label books was so large that it feels like a small miracle that the content actually lived up to the hype. Remarkably, all that potential of Academy Award winning screenwriter John Ridley taking on the DC Universe is actually met, with a fascinating exploration of the role of race, social status, and class in the well worn superhero comics landscape.Guiseppe Camuncoli illustrates what is effectively a series of 5 biographies from the POV of Black Lightning, Mal Duncan, Katana, Renee Montoya and Thunder (the daughter of Black Lightning). This is DC’s Marvels, but if Busiek and Ross were more interested in society than supes.NK Jemesin and Jamal Campbell’s Far Sector is an instant classic, finally concluding this year with the best Green Lantern story in years. On one hand, the introduction of Jo Mullein is the kind of starmaking character entrance that should permeate the shape of DC’s Green Lantern mythos for years to come, and on the other hand, it would almost be better if Jo wasn’t wasted the way Jessica Cruz, Simon Baz, and arguably even John Stewart have been in the many decades of occasionally tepid Green Lantern ongoings.Ram V is one of my favorite writers in comics right now (These Savage Shores, The Many Deaths of Laila Starr, Blue in Green are all must reads!), but I don’t think he’s had the standout Big 2 work to quite make him the household comic fan must-buy he should be. That’s changing with Swamp Thing, a wonderful limited series with Mike Perkins and Aditya Bidikar.Ironically, Ram V’s work on Catwoman is every bit as good, but it’s the use of Future State as a launching pad for Levi Kamei’s role as the new DC Swamp Thing that feels truly special, like we’re at the start of a special creative genesis. Swamp Thing feels like a work very much in conversation with the character’s legacy (particularly Alan Moore’s), but building towards something we’ve never seen before, and that’s exactly what shared universe comics should do.DC Rebirth ensnared Damian Wayne, son of the bat, in the very charming Super Sons, but after five years of the World’s Tiniest, it’s time for a new look for Damian. Joshua Williamson and Gleb Melnikov take Damian out of Gotham and into a League of Lazarus Hunger Games esque assassin tournament to wash off the battering of Tom King’s City of Bane. Easily one of my favorite surprises from DC in Infinite Frontier.If we’re being honest, the bar for a beloved Infinite Frontier Nightwing relaunch was remarkably low. After literal years of wandering the wastelands with the lost memories of Ric Grayson, Tom Taylor and Bruno Redondo return Dick Grayson, Nightwing, to Bludhaven and the familiar challenges of Nightwing’s past. The difference this time is that after the death of Alfred in “City of Bane,” the bat-family father figure leaves Dick an immense fortune, and now it’s up to him to solve the problems of Bludhaven with tremendous wealth.It’s an interesting set-up, and Tom Taylor brings precisely the same level of heart and human empathy to Dick Grayson as he’s done across both the DC and Marvel universes for years now. The real star, though, is the style and flair of Bruno Redondo and Adriano Lucas, capturing a unique blend of David Aja’s Hawkeye and Chris Samnee’s Daredevil.I put off checking out Infinite Frontier Wonder Woman for a long time. I really wanted to love the G. Willow Wilson and Mariko Tamaki runs, but was never especially enamored with either (despite loving both writers!). After the alleged starring role in the hypertime chaos of the tremendously disappointing Death Metal, what would make this era of Wonder Woman any different?In the hands of Becky Cloonan, Michael W. Conrad, and Travis Moore, the answer is to mix up Diana’s mythology, landing her in a mystery of Norse gods instead of her usual Amazons and Olympians. Maybe it’s just the concerning amount of God of War I’ve been playing lately, but it’s thrilling to watch Diana navigate the Aesir and Vanir with fresh eyes, familiar but dramatically different from the Asgard of Marvel’s Thor-verse. In addition to the change of realms, Wonder Woman is also full of just the right amount of surprise DC Universe cameos and intrigue.I’m generally skeptical of the surge in “color” based anthology comics (Harley Quinn: Black, White & Red, or Marvel’s Wolverine Red White and Blood), but Superman: Red & Blue is a standout exception. It’s riveting to watch rotating roundtables of excellent comics creators take their shot at a 10 page short Superman story to match the character’s impossibly rich & iconic legacy. The anthology format works wonders for Superman, a character with such a depth of mythology and thematic resonance to work with.There’s a lot of great work throughout the collection to date, but standouts for me so far include the Coffin Bound creative team with a Mxyzptlk story, James Stokoe with classic Silver Age Superman sci-fi, and Daniel Warren Johnson’s “Generations.” Truly, though, there are far more hits than misses, and the nice thing about anthologies for Superman is you’re not stuck with a creative team you don’t like! My main criticism is I’d like to see more from the Superman family/mythos, as the Chuck Brown and Denys Cowan take on Val-Zod is a nice surprise in the bunch.Grant Morrison’s “last” DC Comics work, a four issue miniseries starring an aged Superman and a reformatted Authority, is a fascinating capstone on a glorious career writing Supes. I love the decision to focus on a post-peak Superman, to reflect on how the Justice League have helped and failed the world in equal measures over the decades, and to consider a passing of the torch as Superman moves from unbeatable brawler to team-assembler and strategist.Mikel Janin gets to graduate from gorgeous Batman art to gorgeous and regularly strange Fort Superman work, as Morrison calls back to favorites like Natasha Steel, Ultrahumanite, and the New Gods.Honestly, though, the best writing you’ll find on the subject matter comes here, from David Mann’s piece on the full history of Morrison and Superman!I’m pretty endlessly interested in new futures for Shilo Norman, the successor to Scott Free’s “Mister Miracle” mantle from Jack Kirby’s New Gods. Apart from Kirby and Grant Morrison’s work on Seven Soldiers, there isn’t a heckuva lot of material though! Shilo’s story gets a new spin through Future State and now into a six issue miniseries.Brandon Easton does interesting work here exploring Shilo as an individual, and specifically as a black celebrity whose skin color isn’t known by the adoring fandom of the greatest escape artist show on earth. Fico Ossio and Rico Renzi give “Source of Freedom” an explosive vibrancy, making it truly one of the most spectacular visual spectacles across the DC line right now.Honorable Mentions: Static Shock: Season One, Batman, Catwoman, Titans Academy, Crush & Lobo, Batman: Urban Legends, RorschachFiled Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: best ofs, DC ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

It’s home to some of the most iconic characters in all of pop culture, such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. These characters have slowly transcended the superhero genre to the point that it’s rare that you go a day without seeing a person walking down the street in either a Superman or Batman shirt.\n",

Along the way, the company has produced some of the best comic books ever, with many of them receiving high praise from TIME Magazine and The New York Times. Unfortunately, the company has lost touch with the general public in recent times. Reading DC comics has become more and more like a chore every week, and while hardcore fans still pick these books up, it’s purely out of habit— instead, we turn to movie adaptations like the Green Lantern and Christopher Nolan’s Batman. \n",

      "Whether you're wanting to get into Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, or any superhero either in the Justice League or out of it, you'll need the right starter comics for getting into DC. Backstory, reboots, resets, parallel universes and varying timelines - it can be a lot, but it's worth it if you can find that easy way in with a good read with all the necessary details.That's where we come in to help. In our guide below we'll show you all the easiest comic stories and arcs to find your way into DC comics, whoever your favourite character is, as well as some basic info on DC itself.If you're struggling to get into DC Comics, that's more than fair. It's not easy to get into any big franchise with a big history, and though it's absolutely worth the effort, we can't blame you if you feel a bit intimidated or put off. Fortunately, there's some cheat codes and easy solutions to that. For one thing, check out our piece on the best Marvel Comics, as the guidelines and tips we put there are also great when it comes to DC too! Once you know those, all you need to do is pick one of the comics listed below and you'll be off. Oh, and a quick, wild history lesson first.So here's the thing: DC has often tried to simplify or fix elements of their history for the sake of readers with big, cosmic events or time-control events. So whereas Marvel - for better or worse - is generally one long timeline that remains largely consistent, DC will occasionally reboot or reset their multiverse with some changes, often designed to make it easier for new readers. Problem is, the result is that now there's a big, looping history that twists and reverses and changes and can seem more bewildering than ever. Fortunately, we've laid out some of the biggest markers below, when they were published, and what you need to know about them.DC's universe wasn't initially planned, it arose naturally as more and more comics were written under the same company, and little crossovers and team-ups became the norm. And all this began with Superman in the first ever issue of Action Comics in 1938, kickstarting \"the golden age of comics\" and leading to decades of DC and multi-generational heroics.In the 1950s and 60s DC were remaking a lot of their old heroes in a more modern, sci-fi style, but this was leading to a lot of bemused questions from fans. Why were there two guys called Superman? Why was one Green Lantern a man in an opera cape, and another was a space cop? The multiverse had been referenced and alluded to before, but here was where it began properly, as an explanation to these kinds of questions. There was more than one universe, with duplicates of different heroes! A whole multiverse of heroes and villains was built off the back of this, with the main two realities being referred to as \"Earth One\" and \"Earth Two.\"This is the big one; the crossover event so huge that it split DC in half, with fans referring to everything before and after as being \"Pre-Crisis\" or \"Post-Crisis\". Structured as both a celebration of DC's history, as well as a complete rebuilding and streamlining of their lore, it redefined everything. Even the tagline went \"worlds will live, worlds will die, and nothing will ever be the same.\"It certainly lived up to that message: all the multiverse was shattered, rebuilt and merged together, erasing everything down to one reality that was pretty much beginning anew. Most of the comics that came afterwards were reboots of classic heroes' origins, setting a firm history to work from, and even though the wider multiverse would return two decades later in the sequel event, Infinite Crisis, now we had a firm core universe that everything was centred on, and a firm history to go with it. At least until…Yes, we're back to the Flash again. Wanting to recreate the success of Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC rebooted their whole reality when Barry Allen runs back in time and changes a bunch of things by accident. He puts it back as best he can, but the result was the New 52: a whole new wave of comics that, again, reset and retold all the big hero's stories and began them anew. This was the new status quo forever!Well, for about five years, at least. Convergence is a grand, complicated ol' story of reality being mangled and unmangled, but the result was the full restoration of the DC multiverse and the recreation of the pre-Flashpoint timeline. Nothing from the New 52 was erased, but now there was just a New 52 universe, and the previous Post-Crisis universe next to that. I guess it's the best of both worlds when there's literally two worlds in play.In the wake of Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC began to rebuild and renew all their heroes, starting from the basics, and John Byrne's renowned telling of Clark Kent's origins is a perfect beginning for that. It sets all the big elements of the Superman mythos into play with a fun, light-hearted tone, and helped establish the Last Son of Krypton's origins in a way that'd define the legendary hero for decades.There's no shortage of Batman comics to leap onto, but few of them are as expansive as Batman: Hush, which introduces many characters, but also tells an entirely fresh story that works on its own. Aside from Jim Lee's artwork being achingly good, it's a mystery story about an unknown figure sabotaging Batman's efforts by collaborating with numerous other villains. Each individual issue focuses on Bruce and one of his supporting cast, giving a great sense of the scope of Batman's world and introducing you to all the people in it. It's also got one of the very few examples of a Superman/Batman fight that doesn't come across as completely ridiculous and contrived, and that is an achievement, if nothing else.George Pérez's run is considered one of the great eras of Wonder Woman. Like The Man of Steel, it's a follow-on from Crisis on Infinite Earths, but Pérez's work carried on beyond a simple retelling of Diana's origins into a vast epic of mythology that spanned the DC universe and back again. Wonder Woman's origins have always changed across the era - from god to demigod to ambitious pottery project - but the core of the character is set in stone and the reason why Diana has been an icon for all this time.Aquaman is many things - hero, warrior, outcast, king - but here in the wake of the Convergence event and the Rebirth relaunch, we see him as something new: an ambassador. Working to build relationships between Atlantis and humanity, all of Arthur and Mera's work is put under threat when a mysterious force begins trying to sabotage matters with a series of planned attacks. It's a fun, quietly clever book that does respect to all the characters and effortlessly introduces Atlantis to humanity - us included.Flash stuff is a little complicated: there's three characters all with a claim to being THE Flash. There's Jay Garrett and his tin helmet in the forties, Barry Allen as the most famous Flash in the 50s onwards, and his nephew Wally West taking over when Barry died in Crisis on Infinite Earths (don't worry, he got better later on). If you're talking iconic though, Barry is considered by most to be the definitive Flash, and there's no better way to get why than starting with his beginnings in 1956, as well many of his famous villains in the follow-up issues.The Green Lantern mythos is a massive, crazy idea: a whole organization of cosmic law enforcement using weaponised courage channelled through jewellery, all as part of a whole spectrum of harnessed, colour-themed emotions. With all that in mind, best start from the beginning. Emerald Dawn is the retelling of Hal Jordan, the first Green Lantern's origins (there's been about five or six Earth-born Lanterns total since then), in his journey from cocky test pilot to… er, cocky superhero.Many of you probably know Oliver Queen simply as \"Arrow\" after the TV show, but the bones are pretty similar: a rich industrialist who, after being stranded in a shipwreck, teaches himself mastery of the bow and returns to civilisation as the vigilante hero styled after Robin Hood, known as the Green Arrow. The Archer's Quest is a perfect way to find out about Ollie's history, a walk through his past as he goes looking for old memorabilia and treasures tied to his identity.From villain to antihero to icon, Harley Quinn first appeared in the 90s animated Batman show, but was popular enough to be brought into the comics' continuity. In fact, we see how that's done right here, in a story that outlines her history, her character, and her lasting connection with Poison Ivy, the impact of which we're still seeing in comics now. Harley's history itself is split into two halves: being with the Joker and moving beyond him midway through the New 52, turning into an independent character with her own agenda. Whichever phase you find her in, Harley's always dangerously enjoyable to read.There's been a hundred different versions of the Justice League, with different names, line-ups and causes, but perhaps the most enjoyable is Giffen's acclaimed run on the team from the late eighties. With many of the most popular heroes unavailable, Batman forms a new version of the League, largely using B-lister heroes like Guy Gardner, Mister Miracle and Doctor Fate. The tone was light and comedic, with many readers fondly remembering the bumbling bromance between Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, which carries on in DC to this very day. It's probably not the perfect representation of the Justice League, not with how goofy it gets (or how certain characters feel like caricatures of themselves), but it's fun and fresh, and determined to make you enjoy yourself no matter what.There you have it - a whole multiverse of comics to be starting with, with hundreds more beloved characters beyond that, from the New Gods to Swamp Thing to the Teen Titans to Zatanna to Animal Man and more!

No part of this site or its content may be reproduced without the permission of the copyright holder.The Ten Best DC Comics Books, Right NowYesterday, Matt shared his picks for the best Marvel books, and tomorrow, David will share his thoughts on Image’s. This is a decidedly different list than either of theirs.Here’s why: slowly, DC has been reshuffling their creative deck and, due to that, are currently serving up the best books they have since… well, since the New 52 launched, honestly. Despite a number of great creators leaving the company, DC seems to have been finally placing the “right” creatives on many of their projects. Because of that, this was a much harder task than I had anticipated.Not that their line is in great shape; there are still quite a few books coming out that are pure trash, and a lot more that don’t distinguish themselves in any real way, featuring a ton of artistic fill ins, overly dark/violent turns for no real reason, and the same, Jim Lee-influenced art that dates the books quickly and permanently. It is also a list full of brand new books or brand new creative teams. In fact, only three of these teams have been on their assigned book for more than a year, and three of these books haven’t even been in print for a year, with two having debuted in the past two months. I took the “right now” caveat quite seriously.So, with those caveats laid out, enjoy the list!10. Batman/SupermanWritten by Greg PakIllustrated by Jae LeeWhy It Made the List: Despite a few hiccups, the Bat-corner of the New 52 has always been in pretty decent shape. The Superman side, on the other hand, has been a dumpster fire of epic proportions. With the upcoming film featuring these two characters already in production it was clear that there would be some sort of team up book coming, but I think few expected the book that we got.Aside from a forgettable middle arc featuring Brett Booth art, this book has been an exceptionally thoughtful and well-crafted book. Each line of dialogue and panel seems deliberate and measured, as if Pak and Lee and trying to get at the absolute core of who these characters are – not just now, but from all time.This is also one of the most stylized books that DC is putting out, which could be polarizing to some, but is rather exciting to me. Lee’s art is inimitable, and the tone he brings to the book is something that is closer to a prestige-format book than a monthly floppy. That further elevates Pak’s scripts to a place that feels somehow “above” current continuity – which, given some of the editorial choices elsewhere in the line, is a good place to be.9. Green Lantern CorpsWritten by Van JensenIllustrated by Bernard ChangWhy It Made the List: The best thing to happen to the health of the Green Lantern family of books was Geoff Johns stepping away from them, if only because it gave the four “team” books (not counting “Sinestro” or the soon to be departing “Larfleeze”) a chance to stake out their own identities and do some new things. Of all of these books, “Green Lantern Corps” has been the most consistently enjoyable since, and it is the book that, on the surface, changed the least. The “Corps” title has been used primarily to bring the concept of the Corps back to its core: these are, essentially, space cops.“Corps,” under the pen of Van Jensen and pencil of Bernard Chang, have embraced this role pretty flawlessly, letting the camaraderie become an essential part of the book, as well as the idea of following orders you don’t necessarily agree with. This book also has the most vibrant colors in DC’s entire catalog, courtesy of Marcelo Maiolo.  His presence on the book elevates it and, because of those bright, almost neon colors, and expressive, cartoon-ish style Chang brings, the visuals gives the book a feel not unlike the short-lived, and under-appreciated, Green Lantern: The Animated Series. That is a great touchstone for this book, as it means that the book is doing exciting, accessible, and enjoyable work.8. AquamanWritten by Jeff ParkerIllustrated by Paul PelletierWhy It Made the List: For the first 20+ issues, “Aquaman” was a book that was a huge commercial success, but left myself and a huge swath of the critical community cold. The character became unnecessarily dark and humorless, and the book became entangled with Antlantean politics to the degree that it ceased being about Arthur Curry, and instead was something more akin to a soap opera set under the sea.Enter Jeff Parker. Parker didn’t exactly turn the book into a “bwahahaha” revival, but he injected some much needed personality into the book, while keeping Paul Pelletier’s detailed, clean line. The supporting cast, while still dealing with Atlantis more than I’d care for, has become focused more on the small town of Amnesty Bay and Arthur’s relationship with the people he grew up with, both in Maine and on land in general.  Parker also adds a bit of super secret science, one of my favorite comic tropes, to the mix, along with some of the mythological fun from the “Wonder Woman” side of the DCU.  Taken all of that together, and the book has a really rich miasma from which Parker and Pelletier can pull from, to take Aquaman – a hero that can control 70% of the Earth – just about anywhere.  Plus, in the first issue of the run, Mera used her water powers to shoot him like a rocket into the atmosphere so he could punch a monster mega-hard. That’s just awesome.7. New 52: Futures EndWritten by Brian Azzarello, Keith Giffen, Dan Jurgens, and Jeff LemireIllustrated by Patrick Zircher and othersWhy It Made the List: I know this is risky – the book has been in publication less than a month and, at press time, has only had three issues come out, one of which was not nearly as strong as the other two. However, this series is doing something that’s different and playing with the expectations and realities of the New 52 in a way that no other series has since it launched almost 3 years ago.In my opinion, if DC had done a weekly spinning directly out of “Flashpoint” that could have connected some of the stray corners of the New 52 and given space for stories that didn’t necessarily carry enough weight for a series (like, say, “Blackhawks”), the initiative might have had more of a fighting chance to crawl into the public’s good graces. Instead they waited 30 months, but the results are more or less the same. It is fun to see Firestorm, Grifter, Stormwatch, etc, all popping up to get in on the action. Despite the book taking place five years in the future, we are finally getting some real world building.This book feels like the glyph that can unlock the potential of the New 52. And, from where we sit, this is one of DC’s better books. Of course, this could all fall apart, but couldn’t all of it?6. Justice League UnitedWritten by Jeff LemireIllustrated by Mike McKoneWhy It Made the List: Some of the best Justice League stories have taken place when the “Big 7” aren’t the core team on the book. I know DC has forgotten this over the past few years, but it remains true. When the book has a mixture of interesting characters, it doesn’t matter if they are the A list, or close to the C+ list – good writing and art will elevate any team to stardom (see: “Justice League International”).Enter “Justice League United” – Mike McKone has taken the team provided and created a unified (pardon the near pun) look that not only draws on their classic looks, but updates a few of them in ways that make sense, and aren’t just throwing a high collar on everyone.  The setting, thus far, of Northern Ontario also gives the book a location that isn’t simply a city or an orbiting base, but rather a visually unique, and culturally relevant, area to occupy.  And, if solicitations and interviews are to be believed, the team will also be all over the galaxy, which is a sadly under-utilized part of the DCU (outside of the Lantern books).  And Jeff Lemire, a Multiversity favorite from early on, has given these characters purpose and opportunity to be a team that can actually be something greater than the sum of its parts.  By both creating new characters, re-introducing old ones, and giving some from the stray corners of the New 52 a new lease on life, Lemire can craft a team that doesn’t rely on star power, or even a corner of the universe to occupy (like “Justice League Dark”), but rather a team that can be adaptable and handle whatever is thrown at them.Which, coincidentally, sounds a lot like the Justice League.  5. BatmanWritten by Scott SnyderIllustrated by Greg CapulloWhy It Made the List: This has become, along with “Wonder Woman,” the equivalent of rap and country. When I was a kid, a common (and stupid) response to “what kind of music do you like?” was “everything but rap and country.” Well, ask many readers now, “what do you read from DC?” they will answer “only Batman and Wonder Woman.” Snyder and Capullo were, initially, seen as a mismatched pair when this book was announced, but they have proven that they bring out the best in each other, and have now told three nearly year-long epic stories within the pages of “Batman,” and the pair seems to be going quite strong.Their dedication to the long form story is what sets this book apart, but it also is what keeps it at #5 on my list. If, for some reason, ‘Zero Year’ didn’t strike your fancy, well, the better part of a year is going to not interest you. These long form stories are best (and detractors may say, only) experienced from beginning to end. So, that also means that it is not the most new-reader friendly book on the shelves (although, to be fair, few of these are). That said, if you’re looking for a focused, blockbuster-style Batman story, you can’t go wrong with this book.4. Detective ComicsWritten by Brian Buccellato and Francis ManupalIllustrated by Francis ManupalWhy It Made the List: Look, I get it. Where do I get off putting a run two issues in in the fourth place position of this list? Well, a couple of things have led to this decision. The first being this: Buccellato and Manapul have emerged as one of the best creative pairs in comics today. The second is this: while this is the third Bat-related book on the list, this is the only one that doesn’t feel like it has a precedent set for it.This is the book that DC is literally named after, and a pretty good way to judge the health of their company is to look at how “Detective” is doing. And the book, post-new team taking over, looks like a pretty spectacular place to spend some time. For one thing, the book is about Batman actually thinking through an issue – it shows him being a detective. It also is one of the few books to escape from the biggest visual problem DC has right now, and that is its dull coloring house style. Most of the stories set in Gotham, especially, suffer from an overuse of drab browns and greys, and Buccellato, in his role as colorist, is not guilty of that at all.The most obvious thing about the book, from a physical production standpoint, is that (much like the next two books on the list) it doesn’t look like anything else on the shelves right now. The team has brought some of the eternal hopefulness from “The Flash” and, without changing who Batman is or what he is all about, made a book that feels more optimistic than any Bat-book has in a long time.3. Green ArrowWritten by Jeff LemireIllustrated by Andrea SorrentinoWhy It Made the List: It is no surprise that a few of the books on this list are self-contained entities, allowed to operate in their own little corner of the DCU without too much interference from other creators or crossovers. That is, more or less, the story of “Green Arrow” since Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino took over.In addition, the book took a risk by incorporating Diggle, a character created for Arrow, into the cast, and has done so more or less flawlessly. Part of the turnaround of this book, which was among the worst in all of comics before the current team took over, has been the absolutely incredible art by Sorrentino. One part David Aja, one part Sean Phillips, Sorrentino’s work is never dull, and brings a totally unique look to the book.It also is a book that isn’t afraid of the character’s own history, nor is it beholden to it.  An upcoming arc appears to be hinting at the tone/general concept of the famous “Longbow Hunters” arc, and yet I’m sure Lemire and Sorrentino have no interest in simply rehashing an old story.  They are doing exactly what the New 52 was supposed to do – tell good stories that didn’t require 50+ years of knowledge to enjoy them.  But when they tap into some of that history, it allows folks who grew up reading these comics a nostalgic tingle down their spine, without alienating the new readers.  Other creative teams: take note.  2. Wonder WomanWritten by Brian AzzarelloIllustrated by Cliff ChiangWhy It Made the List: This book is second only to “Batman” in terms of consistency over the first 30 issues, and might have the edge on the book in terms of quality per page (a new comics cum sabermetrics statistic I just invented). Led by the fearless Brian Azzarello and Cliff Chiang, they have crafted a world for Diana that feels almost completely removed from the DC universe proper.This is the perfect anecdote to the asshole who says “what makes Wonder Woman so special?” Her mythological origin has been updated with a powerful, emotional kicker which, although anathema to many long time fans, gave the book a hook that took the supporting cast from superfluous to essential.Although Chiang has only illustrated about half of the issues, his usual sub of Tony Akins is simpatico enough to stay within the lines Chiang established as the look for the series. This is one of the very few New 52 runs that has been long enough and good enough to stand alongside the most classic of DC stories, and will be surely missed come the end of the summer, when a new creative team takes over.1. Action ComicsWritten by Greg PakIllustrated by Aaron KuderWhy It Made the List: Greg Pak is the only writer currently working for DC who seems to really understand what makes Superman tick – and DC needs Superman to tick. I mentioned in the “Detective” write up that a good way to judge DC’s health is the success of “Detective” – while that is true, the heart and soul of DC has always been “Action Comics.” Nothing makes DC itself more than Superman. And for the first time in a long time, Superman seems to be in good hands.When Grant Morrison took over “Action” with the New 52, he said he wanted a book that always felt like it was moving. I found this quote curious, because his “Action” didn’t feel like that; this “Action” does, and a huge credit for that has to go to Aaron Kuder, who has grown into an absolute superstar. Each panel Kuder draws (which, sadly, isn’t all of them – he’s needed some fill-in help as he scripts the last arc of “Superboy”) leaps off the page with such gusto and personality that the book becomes infectious.“Action” has focused a lot on Lana Lang, and she, in many ways, is the avatar of the creative team. She’s the second or third most popular Superman love interest, she has been grossly underutilized in the past, and she is such a breath of fresh air when thrust into the spotlight. It might have taken DC 25 or so issues to get “Action” right, but once they did, they knocked it out of the park. Here’s hoping that, with its two signature books working extraordinarily well, a few new series kicking ass, and some of their most important properties heading in new directions, when I make this list this year, it is an even harder task.Brian Salvatore is an editor, podcaster, reviewer, writer at large, and general task master at Multiversity.

The costumed do-gooders have been saving their respective fictional universes from unstoppable threats for almost a century, entertaining millions of fans through comic books and various film and TV adaptations. One of the driving forces behind the rise of the superheroes in comic books was DC Comics. Upon its inception in 1934, the company soon became a major part of a revolution that helped put superheroes on the map, as it created the likes of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, that was only the beginning.From metahumans to aliens (and everything in between), DC has introduced readers to a wide array of colourful crime-fighters over the past century. But with a roster of such rich characters, you can't help but wonder which of these revered heroes reigns supreme as DC's greatest creation?Commissioner Gordon's crafty daughter Barbara wanted to make the world a better place, and thus took the law into her own hands as lone vigilante Batgirl. After making a name for herself as a crime-fighter, she was officially welcomed into The Dark Knight's extended Bat-Family, becoming an integral part of the team. Though there already was a Batgirl in the comics, the classic sixties Batman TV series rewrote the character's origins (introducing her as Jim Gordon's daughter) and the comics did the same to keep in-line with the show. This has since become the definitive Batgirl.There are few characters in comic book history as resourceful as Babs. Whether she was fighting crime in the field as Batgirl or providing comms assistance as Oracle, she redefined what it was to be a female superhero - overcoming the odds, a male-dominated society, and working as Oracle to save people even after Joker's horrific attack.With an integral role on Batman's team, as well as being the voice of the Birds of Prey, Barbara has been involved in some of DC's most compelling storylines. Her popularity has sky-rocketed over the years, thanks to her starring roles in arcs like Batgirl Of Burnside - as well as her involvement in TV shows Batman: The Animated Series and The Batman.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tThe 12 Greatest DC Superheroes of All TimeDC Comics is home to myriad superheroes and villains, including many of the most iconic characters to grace the comic book page. However, even within that vast universe of mythic figures, a few heroes soar above the rest, whether owing to their compelling backstories, visually interesting powers, or — in most cases — a combination of the two.So let’s take a look at our definitive list of the top 12 DC superheroes.As half of the Dynamic Duo, Dick Grayson began as Batman’s sidekick but broke out of his Boy Wonder binds to become a bona fide DC superhero in his own right. Nightwing uses the lessons he learned from his brooding mentor — minus the darkness, plus a glimmer of hope — to take down DC’s villains. He is the kinder, gentler Batman. Like his fellow DC superheroes Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, Billy Batson lost his parents when he was a child. Their untimely demise sent him on a righteous path to an ancient wizard, Shazam. The wizard bestowed the boy with the power to transform himself into an adult superhero of the same name by summoning a magic lightning bolt with one word: “Shazam!” When he first appeared in Whiz Comics No. 2 in 1940, Shazam outsold Batman and Superman, The New York Times reported. His popularity led to an eponymous 1974 live-action TV series, a 2019 Hollywood blockbuster, and its 2023 follow-up, Shazam! Fury of the GodsIt's official: Booster Gold is the worst gift-giver of all-time. What's your review of \"The Gift\" Part One in BATMAN #45? pic.twitter.com/gFzeleLeHfBooster Gold doesn’t have the name recognition of his Justice League contemporaries, but he’s no less important (and awesome), hence his inclusion on our DC heroes list. His comic series infuses much-needed comedy into the otherwise grim DC canon, as a time traveler from the future using his advanced technology to become a celebrity superhero.A few years ago, Warner Bros. even had plans for a standalone movie that many theorized would be DC’s answer to Marvel’s wildly popular Guardians of the Galaxy saga. But so far, nothing has materialized. Film writer Zack Stentz told The Fanboy Podcast in 2019 that the script is complete, but he’s waiting for the studio to make the next move. Much in the same way Marvel entrusted the future of its fledgling streaming universe to Daredevil, DC tagged the Green Arrow to launch its TV empire on The CW. The move paid off in spades, featuring the green-hooded archer in all his broody glory.Originally, DC was content to have him basically act as a Batman clone who used a bow and arrow. But in the years since his creation, Green Arrow has taken on a personality of his own, pushing the Justice League into a progressive, forward-thinking mindset.Do you know the cost of magic? Share your thoughts on JOHN CONSTANTINE: HELLBLAZER #12  #DCBlackLabel pic.twitter.com/tV9aKOnU11As the gatekeeper for all things supernatural, John Constantine plays an integral role among the DC superheroes. The skilled magician and resident demon-fighter leads the “Dark” iteration of the Justice League and is known for his trademark brown trenchcoat, snarky quips, and frequent chainsmoking.He wonderfully embodies the seedy underbelly of DC’s superhero world, protecting the planet from the spawn of Hell itself.Aquaman’s powers may not always be useful in a land-based battle, but there’s no denying his importance in the larger DC universe. As the King of the Seven Seas, he shoulders great responsibility while watching over all the creatures of our planet’s oceans.And Aquaman got even cooler when resident Hollywood badass Jason Momoa played the hero in the 2018 movie of the same name.A strong argument can be made for why Martian Manhunter is the most powerful hero in the Justice League. Possessing a wide range of psychic, physical, and sensory abilities, he’s a valuable ally among DC heroes. Beyond that, he also acts as an intriguing foil for Superman, as a fellow alien forced to watch his society come crumbling down around him.You can see him on The CW’s Supergirl, a live-action depiction he rightly deserves.Probably the most famous female comic book hero, Wonder Woman was the only member of the DC Comics “Trinity” —  alongside Superman and Batman — to never star in her own film. But that changed when Gal Gadot portrayed the character in the standalone blockbuster Wonder Woman.  Considering she is as powerful as Superman, Wonder Woman — whose origin story is steeped in Greek mythology — deserves to be as popular as her male counterparts. Given her 2017 film and 2020 follow-up, Wonder Woman 1984, casual fans finally learned how fascinating a figure she really is.Don’t let that 2011 Ryan Reynolds film fool you. Green Lantern may have yet to be effectively translated to live-action, but the character has a long-standing history as one of DC’s most powerful heroes.Like the Flash, numerous men have wielded the magical ring that is the signature of the intergalactic law enforcement group the Green Lantern Corps. However, all have proven to be strong additions to comic book lore — from Hal Jordan to John Stewart. It appears to be just a matter of time until the character’s name and the imaginative source of his powers finally achieve redemption in the eyes of casual superhero fans unfamiliar with his many successful appearances in comics and animated adaptations.The Flash may not have the same marquee value among non–comic book readers, but the character is catching up with his fellow Justice League members fast (after all, he is the fastest man alive). Often depicted as more fun and relaxed than most other top DC heroes, the character has long been a staple of the comics and finally broken into the mainstream, thanks to the hit series on The CW.Flash has also undergone loads of evolution over the years, with different men donning the suit. Regardless of which version of the character appears, the Flash is always a highlight, and his world — which frequently dabbles in time travel — never fails to create new and surprising stories.Undoubtedly one of the most popular heroes of all time, Batman serves as the perfect counterpoint to Superman in the comic books, offering a conflicted sense of darkness and brooding commitment in place of the Man of Steel’s clear view of the planet he serves.Classic works like The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke perfectly capture how morally complex and endlessly thrilling Batman’s world can be, thanks in part to his stunning rogues’ gallery of memorable foes.The Caped Crusader has also seen financial success, with his theatrical releases collectively raking in $2.4 billion to date, Box Office Mojo reports.Perhaps the most recognizable superhero ever created, Superman is probably also the one responsible for the explosion of the genre, as he predates virtually all of the heroes we love today.A paragon of truth and justice, the strongest DC character is known for his unyielding sense of righteousness. And although he has largely been difficult to capture on the big screen — at least since Christopher Reeve donned the red cape — even fans who criticized Man of Steel continue to stand by the last son of Krypton, whose tragic origin has yielded many epic comic book tales over the years.Additional reporting by Nick Cannata-Bowman.Check out Showbiz Cheat Sheet on Facebook! RELATED: ‘Batman’: The Real Reason the 1966 TV Series Was ‘So Corny’screenrant.comThe Best DC Comics Miniseries of 2019In 2019, DC Comics offered readers a wide variety of miniseries to chose from along with the regular ongoing series titles. Here are our favorites!DC Comics, along with the regular ongoing series, provided readers with a wide array of miniseries and limited series in 2019. 2019 saw DC Comics begin to embrace their new, more mature Black Label line of books along with the more whimsical and less serious offerings from the newly minted Wonder Comics line.DC's miniseries, for the most part, offered readers an opportunity not to have to worry about big events, such as the ongoing Year of the Villain, which was one of DC's bigger focuses of 2019. It should be noted that the following list is made up of those series that began and ended in 2019.Related: Will Superman's Powers Ever Let Him Die in DC's Universe?It was a complicated process to pick out which miniseries to include, especially since DC embraced the 12 issue maxiseries format for series such as Steve Orlando and Riley Rossmo Martian Manhunter, Greg Rucka and Mike Perkins' Lois Lane, and Matt Fraction and Steve Lieber's Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen to name a few. Those books began in 2019 and scheduled to end in 2020. The following are the miniseries that were the best of the best of 2019.Since his appearance during Dark Nights: Metal, the Dark Multiverse's the Batman Who Laughs has been one of the leading forces to be reckoned with in the DC Universe. This miniseries, which included a one-shot about the Punisher-esque Grim Knight, finally pitted Batman against the darkest version of himself, pushing him to his limits and beyond as Bruce was forced to come face to face with the nightmares spawned from the Dark Multiverse.Scott Snyder and Jock reunited for this project, which not only gave readers a great and exciting story but also laid the groundwork for The Infected and Hell Arisen story arcs, which is the final installment of the company-wide storyline Year of the Villain. Even though this series seemed to suffer from a staggering publishing schedule, the newest issue was always on the top of our \"to read\" stack.The creative powerhouse team of writer Scott Snyder and artist Greg Capullo, who essentially reinvented Batman in modern times, came together once again to tell the sprawling tale of the Dark Knight, who wakes up in the future and must embark on a quest through a devastated DC landscape. This miniseries, which was one of the first offerings published under DC's Black Label, found its genesis from a short story that Snyder wrote for Detective Comics #27  (vol#2) entitled \"27.\"  The original short story was about a machine that cloned a new Bruce Wayne every 27 years and was supposed to explain how Batman has managed to fight crime for 80 years.Along with the apocalyptic landscape of the DCU, Snyder and Capullo included many elements from their previous collaborations together, such as their The New 52 Batman series and Dark Nights: Metal. This series was not only a fun read but contained a cornucopia of easter eggs and references for fans of the DC Universe. Though billed as \"the last Batman story ever told,\" fans can hope that Snyder and Capullo return to this story in the near future.Related: The 10 Best Comic Book Creators of 2019Female Furies was a remarkable series that used the characters from Jack Kirby's Fourth World to paint a portrait of the abuse and oppression that women in a patriarchal society face, be it on Earth or Apokolips. The story not only centers around the members of the Female Furies and how they react to their leader Auralie's plight but also focuses on Granny Goodness and her struggle as the only female of Darkseid's male-dominated inner-circle.Written by Cecil Castellucci and combined with the energetic art of Adriana Melo, Female Furies not only recontextualized Jack Kirby’s Fourth World but also brought gave it a new and fresh look to the characters and their established histories. Melo's steller artwork imbued the series with a sense of weight and presented the characters in such a way that it accurately reflects their environment.While the \"in the face\" political overtones may have turned some readers off, the story is an accurate reflection of the empowerment and privilege in today's society. Put, this was one of the smartest, best drawn, social commentary series disguised as a comic book.Whereas DC's Black Label imprint focused on the more mature side of the DC Universe, the Wonder Comics imprint embraced the more whimsical and fun aspects of the universe. While Dial H for Hero is a great series, it was Mark Russell's Wonder Twins that stood out as the best miniseries for more than a few reasons. First, Russell was able to take two C-list characters and turn them into two of the most relatable characters in the DC Universe. Russell showed that Jan and Zana not only had to deal with the problems that superheroes face but also those of normal teenagers. Russell also brought in the social commentary aspects he is known for into the series. He not only got to tell a great and funny story but at the same time was able to bring it to the next level like he has done with his other projects at DC Comics like The Flintstones and GLAAD award-winning Exit, Stage Left!: The Snagglepuss Chronicles.It is due to these reasons that it is no surprise that DC extended Wonder Twins from a six-issue miniseries into a twelve-issue run. It's worth checking out.If there was one miniseries on this list that is questionable about its inclusion, Event Leviathan is that entry.Event Leviathan was Brian Michael Bendis' project, which was supposed to change the landscape of the DC Universe. Spinning out of the events of Action Comics, Leviathan was responsible for destroying all the covert super-spy organizations and secret societies in the DC Universe in one fell swoop. Event Leviathan and followed a group of \"the DC Universe’s greatest detectives,\" as they tried to figure out who Leviathan was before they could strike again and reveal who was the mastermind was behind the mask.Even though Bendis maintained that Leviathan wasn’t a new character, but someone who existed in DC Comics canon, the final reveal of Leviathan's identity did leave many feeling cheated. What saved this series and qualified it to be included on this \"best of list\" was the artwork of Alex Maleev. Maleev, who has collaborated with Bendis on such memorable series as Daredevil and various Marvel and creator-owned properties, set the tone for the book and made the visual components of the story the reason to come back each issue.Related: DC's New BATMAN is Everything Fans Love About The Dark KnightOn the surface, DCeased seemed like it was DC's answer to the Marvel Zombies franchise. It proved to be a fast-paced series that focused on the idea of hope and perseverance in the face of devastating events.DCeased centers around the citizens and heroes of the DC Universe being assaulted by a terrifying disease that is spread through technology and turns people into zombielike creatures. This disease was the result of Darkseid bonding the Anti-Life equation with Cyborg's techno-organic components, which he then used to get back at the Justice League for stopping his invasion of Earth. The kicker was that no one was safe, and anyone from the regular citizen to the heroes and villains was considered safe from being zombified as the disease spread.Tom Taylor, the scribe of DCeased, is no stranger to alternate DC universes having writing other limited series such as Injustice: Gods Among Us. In DCceased, Taylor presented a fast-paced story along with excellent small moments between the characters throughout the series. While the ending of the six-issue miniseries seemed a bit rushed, it was well executed and feels like there is more of the story to be told in the future.More: The Best Marvel Comics Miniseries of 2019Chad Burdette is life long comic book reading and collector with many issues, some of which are bagged, boarded, and filed away.

      "You voted on the best DC Comics stories of all time, and these are your resultsThe DC Universe is one of the longest-running superhero universes in fiction - in fact, the American version of the genre started with the debut of Superman in 1938's Action Comics #1.In the decades since, DC has been home to some of the greatest superhero stories ever - and these are the very best DC stories of all time as decided by Newsarama's readers.How do you eulogize the history of a character in two short issues? That's the question Julius Schwartz sought to answer, and he hired Alan Moore to do it - and he did with 'Whatever Happened To The Man Of Tomorrow?.'With the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths effectively ending the Silver Age, Schwartz imagined that his last two issues editing the Superman line were to be the last in human history. In two short issues, Alan Moore created a road map through Superman's history that included his most fearsome villains and his closest friends.And ultimately, he gives the man who has everything the one thing he lacked: a perfect ending. Part of the reason that this is such a pitch-perfect tribute to the Man of Steel is that legendary artist Curt Swan handled the art. He had been drawing Superman since 1948 and from the opening letters \"This is an imaginary story\" to that final, knowing wink from 'Jordan Elliott,' this one feels like a Superman story through and through.It honors the legacy of one of the world's greatest heroes while simultaneously thumbing its nose at the continuity changes that were to take place.Buy: AmazonIn the wake of Crisis On Infinite Earths, Wally West became the new Flash, graduating from sidekick to superhero with the death of his mentor Barry Allen. Wally's transition wasn’t without growing pains, however. He failed to gel with readers until Mark Waid began his landmark run on Flash, giving Wally the depth that his predecessor had often lacked.While it’s hard to argue that there was ever a lull in Waid's original Flash run, 'The Return of Barry Allen ' is likely its apex. In this story, Wally is confronted with the return of the deceased Barry Allen – a story that, under another writer's pen, might have been heartfelt schmaltz, but for Waid, was an examination of Wally's ascent to true heroism, and the moment that solidified him as the one true Flash.Over the course of six issues, Wally and Barry struggle to share the mantle of the Flash until the truth of the return is revealed. Written in a conversational style reminiscent of Wally recounting the tale to a friend, it's as much a conversation between Waid and readers about legacy and heroism as it is between the characters on the page.'The Return of Barry Allen' is something of an unsung pioneer of modern comic books, blending an everyman perspective with a modern narration and a grasp of classic ideals that make it one of the best examples of late 20th-Century superhero storytelling, and one of the best DC stories of all time.Buy: AmazonWhen 'The Judas Contract' began in New Teen Titans #42, the surprise wasn't Terra's apparent heel turn. Marv Wolfman and George Pérez had spent nearly a year introducing Terra to the Titans and making her part of the group and then letting readers in on her terrible secret months before the Titans would learn her true nature.The shock of that issue was just how totally and thoroughly she and Deathstroke owned the Titans because she knew all of their secrets at that point. At the height of their creative energies, Wolfman and Perez's stories were about the unique individuals that made up the Titans. All of the characters are so strong that the introduction of a wildcard like Terra to the team was a great way to shake things up.'The Judas Contract' also focuses on the story of Dick Grayson versus Deathstroke as the two warriors maneuver their allies to counter the other's forces, culminating in the one-time Robin's transition to his new superheroic persona as Nightwing. Just as Grayson moves out of his mentor's shadow, this story proves that the Titans are much more than just a Justice League junior varsity team.Buy: AmazonFor years, the Green Lantern Corps stood as the universe's best and brightest, defending the galaxy through the use of the most powerful weapon in the cosmos — their emerald power rings.But with the action-packed space opera epic 'The Sinestro Corps War,' Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons, along with A-list artists such as Ivan Reis and Patrick Gleason, showed Hal Jordan and company they weren't the only ring slingers in town.Featuring the debut of the fear-powered Sinestro Corps, 'Sinestro Corps War' was a pivotal moment for the Green Lanterns as both an organization and as a franchise, with a murderer's row of iconic DC supervillains thrown against the team, including Parallax, Cyborg Superman, Superboy-Prime, and the Anti-Monitor himself. Yet this book also had key moments of the Green Lanterns rising to this unprecedented challenge, with beats such as John Stewart trading interstellar sniper fire with the hermit crab-like creature known as Bedovian, the Guardians revoking their eons-old edict against killing, or the promotion of Daxamite Green Lantern Sodam Yat as the new, all-powerful Ion as he tackles the unstoppable Kryptonian Superboy-Prime.Culminating with some huge battles and personal redemptions, 'Sinestro Corps War' also led to a greater expansion of the Green Lantern universe as a whole, hinting at the rise of five more corps based on the colors of the emotional spectrum. This explosion of creativity and action not only solidified this as one of the greatest Green Lantern stories but one of the greatest DC stories in history.Buy: Amazon30+ years after its original four-part release, Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley's The Dark Knight Returns is undeniably one of the most powerful Batman stories ever told. A violent tale acted out behind a backdrop of Cold War paranoia and nightmares of a teenage uprising, The Dark Knight Returns follows Batman as he comes out of retirement to wage war against a Gotham City that will no longer tolerate one man taking the law into his own hands.Miller's Bruce Wayne is a silver-haired cowboy dropped into an '80s dystopia, a burly bag of aching bones who finds himself physically outmatched by a new generation of vicious gangs and the return of his arch-nemesis the Joker. Finally, as nuclear war breaks out between the U.S.A. and the Soviet Union, it's up to Superman to take down a Batman hell-bent on cleaning up Gotham's streets.Although written and illustrated when Miller was just 29, The Dark Knight Returns feels like the work of a much older man. It's a satirical look at the evolving media landscape of the '80s when TV became more youth-oriented and even the news began to turn towards entertainment, as exemplified by the many talking heads who narrate the book's events in ways that benefit their own twisted agendas.Although time and countless issues of a harder-edged Batman have since softened the original impact of Frank Miller's pessimistic take on the World's Greatest Detective, its place in comic book history cannot be understated. For that reason alone, 'The Dark Knight Returns' deserves a place in every reader's library.Buy: AmazonIn a modern era of cynicism in comic books, the late Darwyn Cooke was able to showcase the latent optimistic potential of the DC Universe in the now-classic New Frontier. The story is everything that Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns aren't, with DC's marquee characters exhibiting their best traits and inspiring the world and readers alike to fight towards a better tomorrow at the dawn of the nuclear age. Cooke captures an America fresh from World War II and before a cultural shift where the only way comic books could be respected was if they were dragged through the gutter first.New Frontier is unabashed in its love of the superhero as an icon for what humanity could strive towards. Often under-served characters like Martian Manhunter, Wonder Woman, and Adam Strange are given their best interpretations here. Cooke simultaneously gets to the core of these characters and, through this, reinvents them at the same time.Cooke's art is a perfect marriage of influences from DC's storied history - from Jack Kirby to the Fleischer Superman cartoon and Batman: The Animated Series. Even the creator's art style brings out the best of DC's Silver Age with each hero smiling into the sunrise in a post-war art deco style. Darwyn Cooke's magnum opus, New Frontier is a portrait of DC's best side and embodies all the courage and hope that these characters represent in a perfect love letter to the Silver Age of comic books.Buy: AmazonGrant Morrison's intent with the 12-issue series All-Star Superman, one that took almost three years to finish its original publication run, was to create a Superman story that was both fresh and timelessly classic. He does so by tasking the simple question of how Superman would spend his last days on Earth.In a way that's an antidote to his previous exploitative death of the '90s, Superman is seen completing a series of tasks, or 'trials' in the most mythical (or perhaps even biblical) sense. It's a narrative that celebrates everything we have ever loved about the Last Son of Krypton. Morrison funnels his encyclopedic knowledge of the Man of Steel into a singular story in a way that never feels didactic, allowing cameos and appearances from virtually every era of Superman comics without ever needing to crack open the Multiverse to do so.Stripping the character down to his most heroic of essentials, Frank Quitely makes a career-defining turn on the book, casting the hero as a super relaxed version of a near-omnipotent alien. From the barrel-chested Superman, a logical extension of what the ultimate human being would look like, through to the polar opposite in the vulnerable Lex Luthor, Quitely has a way of capturing both the majesty and the humanity of these characters.All-Star Superman remains a quintessential Superman story for new readers through to those with much deeper long-boxes.Buy: AmazonLegion of Super-Heroes' 'The Great Darkness Saga' is one of the oldest stories on this countdown, and hasn't seen many references in the modern DC Universe, but it stands steadfast as an example of what DC stories can accomplish when they combine the classic with the nouveau and find common ground in disparate ideas.'The Great Darkness Saga' tells the tale of Darkseid, dark lord of Apokolips, making his way into the 31st century. The story brought together numerous villains of the Legion of Super-Heroes, uniting them with aspects of the 20th Century DC Universe. It defined the era of the Legion and set the stage for what came for years after.'The Great Darkness Saga' is not just the highlight of Paul Levitz and Keith Giffen's run on Legion of Super-Heroes, it's one of the greatest tales of the modern DC Universe, and a prime reason so many fans still clamor for the Legion even when they aren't part of DC's line.Buy: AmazonDC's continuity leading up into the '80s was rich with nostalgia but convoluted with inconsistencies, leading to the first real mega-event in the company's history: Crisis on Infinite Earths, which shook DC to its core, remixing its timeline and heralding the beginning of a continuity-shuffling practice repeated every decade since.Introducing the literally earth-shattering threat of the Anti-Monitor, this Crisis threw together dozens of heroes from across the Multiverse and was the scene of the then-shocking deaths of Barry Allen and Supergirl. Marv Wolfman and George Pérez juggled a universe full of characters, packing together more panels and action in one issue than many modern series fit into a trade. Earths lived and Earths died, resulting in a true epic that has withstood the test of time 30 years later.The legacy of Crisis also cannot be overlooked, with the streamlined continuity establishing Wally West as the new Flash, and launching into well-received series such as John Byrne's Man of Steel, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli's Batman arc 'Year One' and George Pérez's Wonder Woman run.Buy: AmazonKingdom Come, Mark Waid and Alex Ross's tale of the old guard of DC heroes facing obsolescence in a world protected by a younger and more vicious generation of superheroes is just as powerful now as it was when it was first published in 1996.Thanks to Waid's understanding of the titanic personalities he handles, his presentation that makes them feel human instead of lofty gods, and Ross' gorgeous painted visuals, Kingdom Come is often the first book mentioned when people are asked what their favorite DC stories are.While Kingdom Come stands as an emotional testament to Mark Waid's almost superhuman knowledge of the DCU and Alex Ross's immense talent behind a brush, it also rewards readers who find themselves coming back again and again to Waid and Ross's dystopian Elseworlds series. Whether it is the fact that Ross used the image of his own father, a reverend himself, as the inspiration for point-of-view character Norman McCay or Waid's cameo-filled final showdown that still reveals new heroes amid the din of battle, this story feels new with every reread despite being on shelves for over 20 years.Kingdom Come is a classic in every sense of the word, and continues to stand as the best story that DC has produced – and with 2021 marking the 25th anniversary of the story's release, we expect some renewed attention from DC.Buy: AmazonLove comics but don't know where to start?

      "Rare ComicsTop 50 Marvel Comics Of 2015Top 50 Marvel Comics Of 2015January 13, 2017To repeat the caveat I gave on the main 2000’s page [which has links to see other years within the decade], the list you are about to see involves no judgment or pricing data, but rather simply ranks the universe of Marvel comics published in 2015 by how many copies have passed through CGC’s doors to date — that’s it!This exercise should tease out a very interesting list of “key” or otherwise interesting Marvel comics from 2015 but not necessarily an all-encompassing list (if very few copies were created for a given key, that restricted supply could keep the count of CGC submissions low).  So without further ado, here below is a list of the top 50 most-submitted Marvel comics from 2015 (census numbers are as of year-end 2016).

Trad Moores’s artwork is criticized for this book, but for me Moore’s art was fresh. It wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea.  The story was brilliant as well. Silver Surfer is sucked into a black hole where he finds a nemesis older than time itself.Writer(s): Ed BrissonArtist(s): Mike HendersonLast Issue: #12This is the Death of Wolverine done right. Old Man Logan is dying and he got one last task to do. Kill Mysterio. He wants to prevent what happened on his Earth. Brisson really knows this character. Mysterio’s and Hawkeye’s characterization are well done. With rough and tuff art by Henderson, what more can you want.Writer(s): Gerry Duggan/ Jim Zub/ Roy ThomasArtist(s): Ron Garney/ Patch Zircher/ Alan DavisCurrent Issue: #112019 was a huge year for Conan. From his introduction into the Marvel Universe to fighting alongside Marvel heroes. This book represents all the Conan comics of 2019. We choose this book for the list because for us this is the best Conan comic right now. The first five issues by Duggan was just grand. This book saw lots of shifts from writers but even that can’t detract from this amazing story. Currently in the hands of the amazing Roy ThomasWriter(s): Chip ZdarskyArtist(s): Carlos Magno &Butch GuiceCurrent Issue: #11Anyone who is a fan of Marvel comics knows too well that Donny Cates and Chip Zdarsky are THE best writers Marvel has to offer in 2019. This book is about Marvel’s very first team. Captain America, Namor, Human Torch and Winter Soldier. But now Namor declared war against the surface world. Every issue is a breathtaking ride and rightfully deserves a spot on any top 10 list.Writer(s): Mark WaidArtist(s): Jesus Saiz/ Javier PinaLast Issue: #20Clearly one of the underrated Marvel comics in 2019. Started with Steven Strange finding the cure of magic in space adventure then squaring off with Dormammu with newfound allies. This series is just pure fun to read. Then Waid is joined by Barry Kitson(W) and Scott Koblish(A) to tell the story of Herald Supreme. The story at times feels a little too rushed but it’s still definitely worth the read.Writer(s): El EwingArtist(s): Joe BennettCurrent Issue: #27This book was our #1 pick for Best Marvel Comic of 2018. The only reason it is not our #1 this year because 1-4 are just too good. It started as a horror book, then Hulk was in hell, fought Shadowbase and now cosmic. This book is just perfect. The art of Joe Bennett is justly fitting for this book.Writer(s): Christos GageArtist(s): Mike HawthroneLast Issue: #12When this book started I wasn’t sure where it was going or if it was even necessary. Back in 2012, Slott had already told a perfect ending, but as the story untold, man was I wrong. This book deals with Otto being a hero and a second chance at life. The whole characterization and deconstruction of a character and the relation with a new side of the character is pure joy.Writer(s): Jonathan HickmanArtist(s): Pepe Larraz(HoX)/ R B Silva(PoX)Current/Last Issue: #6 issue eachThese 2 comics right here literally revolutionized the X-Men. Charles Xavier is done with his dream of mutant equality. He is shown why he will always fail. Now its time to take action into his own hands. We can’t emphasize how amazing these books are. Every issue is unpredictable. Readers will never know what’s going to hit them in the next issue. The spin off of these books is Dawn of X which is equally amazing. A little slow but still worth reading.Writer(s): Donny CatesArtist(s): Ryan StegmanCurrent/Last Issue: #20(Venom) / #5(Absolute Carnage)I personally am not a Venom fan. But what Donny Cates did with Venom is spectacular. He created a whole mythos around the symbiote species. This comic is a well-crafted tale of both symbiote and Eddie Brock. While talking about Absolute Carnage, this event is undoubtedly the BEST Marvel event of 2019.Writer(s): Chip ZdarskyArtist(s): Marco Checchetto/ Lalit Kumar SharmaCurrent Issue: #14We have Hulk going cosmic, Venom got a Symbiote God and X-Men have been revolutionized while Daredevil is suffering from mental issues. This is the deconstruction of the character done perfectly. Art varies from issue to issue but it least affects the story which is inexpressibly beautiful. So if you want to read only one comic this year, then this is the comic.If your favorite comics of 2019 aren’t on the list then comment it down below and tell us why you loved it!!Great list Vince, Marvel really had some great books this year. I personally feel that they beat DC this year. YOTV really hasn’t done much in my opinion.Thanks, Nick. Loved that you enjoyed the list!!Great list with some truly accurate reviews- daredevil is by far the best, nothing I ever like ever finished top so thanks for that 😊 look forward to 2020!\n",

      "The Best Marvel Comics of 2021!Comic Book HeraldA Comic Book Reading Order Guide For Beginners & FansNovember 24, 2021 by Dave 2 Comments After the pandemic-impacted 2020, Marvel’s 2021 is slowly but surely back on track, with a wide variety of excellent comics. All in all, it’s a good time to be a Marvel fan, and I’m listing out my favorite picks for those looking to dive in.It’s an interesting year for Marvel, three years after the launch of the “Fresh Start” era, as some of the line’s biggest titles (Black Panther, Immortal Hulk, Venom, & on a technicality, Jonathan Hickman’s X-Men) wind down throughout the year. Even with that turnover, “Fresh Start” is heartily sustained through the Krakoa era of X-Men, an exciting new Marvel Space Age, and a healthy variety of quality throughout the broader universe. Honestly, even some of the big time runs I’m least enthused by (Jason Aaron’s Avengers and Nick Spencer’s Amazing Spider-Man) are remarkably consistent, and offer plenty of intriguing moments. It’s a truly good time to be a fan of Marvel Comics.Below you’ll find my picks for the best Marvel Comics of 2021, updated throughout the year to reflect new books I’m excited about. Check them out here, and let me know anything good I should be reading in the comments!Honorable Mentions: Carnage: Black White & Red, Taskmaster, Black Widow, Beta Ray Bill, Power Pack, Way of XBest Comics of 2021 (So Far)!Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!Best Marvel Comics of 2020Creators: Zeb Wells, Stephen Segovia, Carmen Carnero, Ariana MaherRelevant Issues: #8 to #18Hellions is so good, such a stunning blend of heart and humor, that we don’t even talk any more about how weird it is that a contender for best X-book stars Mister Sinister (yeah), Psylocke (yep), Havok (ok), John Greycrow (…), Wild Child (…), Empath (…) and Nanny and Orphanker (what?!). In so many ways, it’s the promise of the Krakoa era fulfilled, where any mutant can be a star, and totally revamped concepts can thrive.Honestly, the only thing that *hurts* Hellions at this point is the launch of books like SWORD and Way of X that are inherently more integrated into the big picture of what matters in X-Men comics right now. But in many ways, that’s also freeing, allowing Hellions to just be the laugh-out-loud Suicide Squad reimagining we didn’t know we needed.Creators: Al Ewing, Valerio Schiti, Marte Gracia, Ariana MaherRelevant Issues: SWORD #2 to #12Creators: Al Ewing, Juann Cabal, Federico Blee, Cory PetitRelevant Issues: Guardians of the Galaxy #10 to #16, Annual #1, GotG #17 to #21Al Ewing’s been good and properly cosmic for a long time, as evidenced by such contemporary must-reads as Ultimates and honestly a good chunk of Immortal Hulk! Giving him the reigns to Marvel’s cosmic landscape – which has been oddly unfocused despite the cosmic focus of events like Empyre and King in Black – is a huge win, and has enormous potential for fans of Marvel heroes across the galaxy.Between the excellence of SWORD (a part of the X-Men’s “Reign of X”) and the increasing complexity and diverse shifts of Guardians of the Galaxy, Ewing’s Marvel Age of Space is shaping up to potentially compete with the halycon days of Annihilation-era mid 2000’s Marvel Cosmic.Creators: Chip Zdarsky, Marco Checceto, Marcio Menyz, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #26 to #37The final Daredevil issue of 2020, Daredevil #25, ended on a major turn for the excellent Chip Zdarsky and Marco Checceto run, one which offers the potential for him to move his run further out of the shadow of all the great Daredevil runs that preceded his. If you don’t know what that turn is – somehow, still – get to reading Daredevil, and skip ahead to the next pick!So.Starting with King in Black tie-ins, the 2021 version of Daredevil follows Elektra Natchios as the Daredevil of Hell’s Kitchen while Matt Murdock fights for survival in prison. And as so often happens when a known Marvel player takes on a legacy mantle (here’s looking at you Bucky, Sam, Flash, Carol and Shuri), it makes for great comics!Creators: Jed MacKay, CF Villa, Brian Reber, Ferran DelgadoRelevant Issues: #2 to #7, Annual #1, #8 to #13I’ve probably told this story before, but I’ll never forget Yokira Cebulski holding up a copy of J. Scott Campbell’s cheesecake pin-up cover of Black Cat #1 at C2E2, excitedly asking “Who likes Black Cat?!” and the mixture of confused, muted clapping that followed. It’s not like Felicia Hardy isn’t a popular, enduring supporting player in the Spider-Man Universe, but if there was a market for a genuinely great Black Cat ongoing, surely that would have presented itself before 2019?Yet, Jed MacKay and Travel Foreman turned the story of Black Cat into one of Marvel’s best series, and MacKay impressively continues the feat in 2021, forced to relaunch Black Cat with a new #1 as part of the King in Black event, and sticking the landing time and time again. A huge part of the hook of this comic is that MacKay and company have turned Felicia’s story into a heist across every corner of the Marvel Universe, deliberately bouncing from reference point to reference point in a way that is seriously entertaining for longtime Marvel fans. Plus, I’ve truly never been more entertained by Felicia and her posse, one of the most entertaining “Crews” in Marvel Comics of the past few years.Creators: Kieron Gillen, Esad Ribic, Matt Wilson, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #1 to #6I used to make jokes that Jack Kirby’s Eternals were primarily good for helping readers get some rest on those sleepless nights, and well, I still will from time to time, but 2021 is certainly the most invested I’ve ever been in the Eternals. A lot of that has to do with the impending introduction to the MCU, with much of my enthusiasm also boosted by Gillen and Ribic’s ongoing Eternals.Eternals is Gillen’s return to the Marvel Universe after four years away, and it’s a brilliant fit, with the very open, yet very vast mythology of Eternals as his playground. Combine that sprawling mythology with Esad Ribic’s, who has one of superhero comics highest batting average across runs on Thor: God of Thunder and 2015’s Secret Wars, and Eternals fits right into the exciting creator-driven world-building of the likes of X-Men and Hulk franchises.Creators: Al Ewing, Joe Bennett, Ruy Jose, Chris O’Halloran, Cory PetitRelevant Issues: #42 to #50There’s really no right time for Immortal Hulk to end, as Al Ewing, Joe Bennet and team have crafted a take on Hulk so instantly iconic, I can’t fathom any readers who won’t feel a tremondous absence following the run’s conclusion with 2021’s Immortal Hulk #50. Nonetheless, Ewing and co. have certainly earned the right to give their saga the rarest of rewards in comics: a proper ending on their own terms.Immortal Hulk will go down as a constant presence on “Best of Marvel Comics” lists in years to come, and with the exception of Greg Pak’s long run starting with “Planet Hulk,” it’s honestly hard to even consider other contenders for Marvel’s best Hulk work (no, I didn’t forget about Peter David’s very long – and frequently very interesting! – work).I don’t want to see Immortal Hulk go, but you know what? Sometimes the green door beckons.Creators: Jed McKay, Alessandro Cappuccio, Rachelle Rosenberg, Corey PetitRelevant Issues: Moon Knight #1 to #6Moon Knight isn’t quite at Daredevil levels of strongest comics per ounce in the Marvel Universe, but the last decade has solidified the story of Marc Spector and Mr. Knight as one of the more interesting creative tapestries in superhero comics. Writer Jed McKay continues an incredible hot streak with Marvel Comics, and artist Alessandro Cappuccio and colorist Rachelle Rosenberg are performing at a superstar level.I think the most exciting thing about this relaunched Moon Knight is that McKay and team are leaning into the full modern history of what’s made the character exciting, from Declan Shalvey’s Mr. Knight redesign to Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino’s surreal psychological mystery. McKay is capturing Spector’s Judaism, disassociative identity disorder,  and feelings of depression as a failed mercenary turned West Coast Avenger. It’s a captivating read, and a series I look forward to reading for a good long time.Creators: Jonathan Hickman, Mahmud Asrar, Sunny Gho, Clayton CowlesRelevant Issues: #17 to #21, Inferno #1 to #4Ranking “X-Men” in 2021 is a little tricky because the Jonathan Hickman written run on the title ends during the summer Hellfire Gala with issue #21, before Gerry Duggan and Pepe Larraz take over with a relaunched “X-Men” #1 for the remainder of the year.As it stands, the Hickman run on X-Men ends on a powerfully strong note through issues #18 to the conclusion, as Hickman returns to plot threads seeded early in his run (issue #5’s Children of the Vault return in X-Men #18 to #19, and issue #6’s story of Mystique, Destiny, and Nimrod returns in X-Men #20). For my money, the run ends in precisely the way House of X and Powers of X promised, with huge payoffs on seeds, mysteries and ideas that make this era of X-Men so exciting.Creators: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Leonard Kirk, Matt Milla, Joe SabinoRelevant Issues: Captain America #27 to #302021 has been a year of critics and fans *finally* coming to terms with the weight and approach of Ta-Nehisi Coates’ Marvel Comics, both as Black Panther ended with his second set of 25 issues (a series that belongs on this list but for the fact that only 2 issues actually came out *this year*), and as Coates Captain America cemented more of its fascinating focus and purpose.That Captain America is a political work should not come as a surprise to anyone who has been reading comics since – checks notes – World War II, but Coates’ late 2020 and 2021 issues of Cap are particularly incisive of this American cultural moment.I’ve said as much before, but Marvel fans are going to look back at the five years of Coates as a major force in the Marvel Universe, and lament that this work wasn’t more fervently appreciated in its time.Creators: Vita Ayala, Rod Reis, Travis LanhamRelevant Issues: #15 to #20The X-Office’s New Mutants went from the weakest most rudderless book in the line to one of the best, and all it took was the creative overhaul adding writer Vita Ayala and artist Rod Reis. That infusion, and a newfound, much-needed focus on the youth of Krakoa, turned New Mutants into a must-read from jump.I’m consistently impressed how *much* story Ayala and Reis pack into each issue, frequently balancing no fewer than three distinct plot threads, yet somehow giving each equal weight and attention. Whether it’s the mysterious nefarious presence of the Shadow King, the growing concerns of Gabby aka Scout, or the old guard New Mutants (Karma, Dani Moonstar, Rahne Sinclair, Magik) training young mutants, this title is an absolute highlight of the Reign of X.Creators: Gene Luen Yang, Dike Ruan, Triona Farrell, Travis LanhamRelevant Issues: Shang-Chi (2020) #1 to #5, Shang-Chi (2021-) #1 to #7The biggest challenge I’ve had with Shang-Chi is comparing the relaunched miniseries, and now ongoing 2021 Marvel series launch to previous works of incredible creator Gene Luen Yang. In 2020, Yang’s work on Dragon Hoops and Superman vs the Klan was literally my favorite in all of comics, and similar accolades can be thrown at the likes of Boxers and Saints or American Born Chinese. Yet, when Yang’s taken over superhero properties (for example Superman), the work has never wowed me in the same way.This holds for Shang-Chi, but honestly it may be an entirely unreasonable bar. Compared to the rest of Marvel – and literally the entire history of Shang-Chi comics in Masters of Kung-Fu – Yang’s reimagining of Shang-Chi’s place in the Marvel Universe is the most I’ve ever enjoyed the character. Yang, Ruan and the team craft an engaging Five Weapons Society, integrate compelling elements of Chinese history, and are doing some challenging work exploring how Shang-Chi presents himself to his family vs. the western Marvel Universe as we’ve come to know it. On top of all that, Yang and team are getting to have fun exploring all corners of the Marvel Universe, from Spider-Man to Wolverine to criminal auctions including the likes of MODOK and Madame Hydra.Creators: Leah Williams, David Baldeon, Israel Silva, Joe CaramagnaRelevant Issues: #6 to #10You know, for its first half, X-Factor felt like a delightful “hang out” comic, giving fans a unique opportunity to spend time with the diverse (and predominantly queer) gang of mutants investigating & confirming mutant deaths for Krakoan resurrections. As the series progressed into 2021, though, the creative unit brought storylines spanning the Mojoverse and the Morrigan full circle, into a frankly astonishing gambit of bringing everything full circle.Leah Williams is my favorite of the new wave of X-Men writers, and combined with the visuals of Baldeon and Silva – some of the best panel layout explorations in Marvel – X-Factor has been a consistent delight. That Marvel is ending the series with its 10th issue – despite satisfactory sales, huge fandom, AND literally the best queer representation in anything from the publisher – is frankly just confusing.Creators: Chip Zdarsky, Pasquel Ferry, Matt Hollingsworth, Phil NotoRelevant Issues: #1 to #5Chip Zdarsky is no stranger to putting Peter Parker through hell, as evidenced by the precurser limited series, Spider-Man: Life Story. Itself a variation on “What If,” Life Story played with the idea of Peter Parker actually aging through the decades – instead of operating on Marvel time – and the effect that a life like *that* would have on a character. Spider’s Shadow is back to Spidey stories grounded in the sliding timeline, set specifically after Peter Parker famously obtained the black symbiote costume in Secret Wars #8.Honestly, the series’ primary question – What if Peter never got rid of the symbiote? – isn’t really that interesting. We’ve seen Peter wrestle with that decision across a wide variety of story, from the original to animated series to feature films to the Ultimate Universe comics. What elevates Spider’s Shadow is how fully Zdarsky and Ferry lean into the premise and proceed to execute fully formed world building shaking up the pieces *around* Peter Parker. It’s a small change on paper, but the shifting of Marvel’s “What Ifs” from one-shots to miniseries really upgrades the potential, and it’s already showing.Creators: Donny Cates, Nic Klein, Matthew WilsonRelevant Issues: #9 to #15, Annual #1, #16 to #20Despite outstanding cosmic visuals from Klein and Wilson, the Donny Cates written era of Thor, following the years long tenure of Jason Aaron, got off to a sluggish start. The “Black Winter” felt a lot like Cates strip-mining his own recent Marvel greatest hits – a Knull-like cosmic figure as the villain, throwdowns with Galactus to establish scope and scale – without much that really spoke to the unique opportunity of Thor, King of Asgard.After the opener, though, Cates, Klein and team have really opened up with a run that feels like *their* Thor. “Prey” in particular is conceptually strong, but honestly even more than that, it’s deeply committed to using the long history and legacy of gods of thunder in energizing, exciting ways. I’m fully back in on this run, and look forward to where Cates, Klein and Wilson can take it from here.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: 2021, best ofs, Marvel ComicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Apocalypse Reading Order Best Tablet For Digital Comics  Is Marvel Unlimited Worth It? Copyright © 2022 · Metro Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log inscreenrant.comThe 10 Best Marvel Comic Books Ever, According To RankerMarvel has some of the best superheroes in comics, and these are the 10 best comic books by the publisher as voted on by the Ranker community.Standing at the top of the comic book mountain with the likes of DC, Marvel Comics has a wealth of popular characters in the superhero medium that spawned some of the publisher's best. The voting community at Ranker compiled a list of the best comic books/graphic novels of all time, and while DC takes the lion's share of the top of the list, Marvel features prominently, as well.RELATED: 10 Best DC Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerDaredevil works have featured toward the top, with the X-Men appearing frequently, as well. It makes sense, as those two properties are some of the most consistently well-written in the superhero genre.The X-Men have suffered greatly in their Marvel Comics history, and this first volume of the series relaunch started on the premise of Cyclops and Emma Frost reforming the team. However, their plans to do so become threatened by the prospect of a \"mutant cure\" being discovered by a scientist, which intrigues an extremely mutated Beat.This first arc was characterized by reintroducing core X-Men characters to set them up down the line and included the revival of Colossus. Astonishing X-Men Vol. 1: Gifted was praised for its story and being a good jumping-on point for a new age.One of the best movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America: Civil War, was loosely based on the Civil War comic crossover arc. Ironically enough, writer Mark Millar and artists Steve McNiven and Dexter Vines' comic book series received a polarizing reception during its 2006-2007 run.The story centered around the U.S. government passing the Superhero Registration Act that required superheroes to operate under official regulation akin to law enforcement. This pit Captain America's rebels against Iron Man's supporters, with the X-Men remaining neutral. However, over time, the meta-commentary explored in Civil War made the comic retroactively become well-received.Similar to DC's past imprints like Vertigo, Marvel has the MAX imprint that focuses on more mature content. One of the best to come out of that line was The Punisher MAX by Garth Ennis, Gregg Hurwitz, and Laurence Campbell. The first volume brings back a classic Punisher villain in the form of Microchip while pitting the titular antihero against two rival gangs in the middle of a bloody war.Its first arc, Kitchen Irish, was also a comic book influence for the acclaimed MCU Daredevil TV series on Netflix. The Punisher MAX took place within the mainline Marvel canon but told a smaller-scale, isolated story that didn't focus on crossing over with other major characters.The MCU's Infinity War and Endgame were loosely influenced by Jim Starlin's The Infinity Gauntlet limited series. Starlin created the villainous Thanos back in the early '70s, and over the years, the writer strung together multiple stories that ended up serving as a sprawling prelude to The Infinity Gauntlet.RELATED: 6 Comic Books To Read After Watching The Witcher Season 2Its plot centered on Thanos having gathered all the Infinity Gems, leading him to a quest to erase half of all life to impress Mistress Death. However, his granddaughter, Nebula, stole the gauntlet, prompting the Titan to team up with the surviving heroes to stop her. The six-issue limited series became one of the most well-received and influential comics of the '90s and spawned several sequels and spinoffs.Writer Chris Claremont teamed up with fellow industry veteran Frank Miller on pencils for one of Wolverine's best comic books. The duo was together in the first Wolverine series, which spanned a four-issue limited series. At this point, it chronicled Wolverine's adventures in Japan facing off against the yakuza and high-profile Daredevil villains, The Hand.Likewise, it also showed the X-Men superhero's engagement with romantic interest Mariko Yashida, who belonged to Japan's powerful Yashida crime family. This arc was an iconic one for the character, with it being the prime influence for 2013's The Wolverine movie directed by James Mangold with Hugh Jackman leading.1994's Marvels limited series was a celebration of the most acclaimed moments in Marvel Comics history. Writer Kurt Busiek and iconic artist Alex Ross had their careers launched thanks to their work on Marvels, which took a grounded and street-level approach to grandiose superhero storytelling.RELATED: 6 Video Games You Should Play After Watching Spider-Man - No Way HomeIt retold famous stories within the universe from the perspective of a news photographer named Phil Sheldon. Such landmark stories include the Fantastic Four defeating Galactus and Gwen Stacy's death at the hands of Green Goblin. This was the \"everyday life of a superhero\" theme that became famous and influenced their and other creators' work across the medium.Chris Claremont and John Byrne's Days of Future Past arc from The Uncanny X-Men series is one of Marvel's most acclaimed X-Men works. It was the inspiration for Fox's similarly titled 2014 movie, with the narrative focused on the X-Men going back in time to prevent a dystopian calamity that leads to peak anti-mutant aggression.This alternate dystopia saw mutants being rounded up and forced into internment camps, prompting the future version of Kitty Pryde to transfer herself into the present-day Pryde to help prevent this. The X-Men were always a strong allegory for civil rights and other social issues, and Days of Future Past is a lynchpin story in the superhero team's mythos.Though Fox failed twice at tastefully adapting it (The Last Stand and Dark Phoenix), The Dark Phoenix Saga comic book arc remains a classic. Veteran X-Men creative duo Claremont and Byrne put together this arc as well, written around Jean Grey becoming a supervillain in the form of Dark Phoenix.RELATED: 10 Best Marvel Comics Heroes Of All Time, According To RankerShe manages to obtain a daunting level of power that maxes out her potential as a telepath, but it corrupts her as a result. The X-Men struggle to combat her and decide whether saving her is worth the disastrous cost of letting her run rampant for too long. Starting with the introduction of the Hellfire Club, The Dark Phoenix Saga spirals into an emotionally resonant story.Industry legend Frank Miller is known for his acclaimed work on Batman and Daredevil, but it was the latter where he got his start. And like he did for the Dark Knight in the '80s with Year One, Miller wrote Daredevil's definitive origin story in The Man Without Fear. This '90s comic book was part of Miller's reinvention of Daredevil that started in the early '80s into the gritty, crime-noir character that he's been celebrated as.The story shows Matt's underprivileged beginnings with his accident and death of his father, to being trained under Stick and beyond. It's a compelling, intimately-scaled story that also introduces key characters that would become pivotal later on, like Foggy, Kingpin, Typhoid Mary, and Elektra. The Man Without Fear also introduced the classic makeshift black suit that the Netflix series would use in seasons 1 and 3.Miller is responsible for many of Daredevil's best-ever comics, with Born Again and the aforementioned The Man Without Fear arguably his best work. The former centers around Karen Page selling Matt Murdock's identity out of desperation, which ultimately gets sold upward to the Kingpin of New York himself.What follows is an intense revenge story depicting Matt Murdock at one of the lowest points in his life, with Kingpin serving as the dark architect of his unraveling. Born Again is a gripping crime drama that culminates in one of the most triumphant and cathartic moments in Daredevil's career. Like with the origin-story comic, it was a major influence on Netflix's Daredevil. Specifically, it was the narrative anchor for the masterful third season.NEXT: 10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About Daredevil & Elektra's RomanceGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston.

      " TOP 10 BEST MARVEL COMICS OF 2016 ComicsBecause I gotten many kind words for my top 10 list for best DC Comics, I'm going follow through on my plans and make another list, this time on the Marvel side!This is my list of the comics I believe are worth checking out. Will some have negatives? Possibly but I believe it's the positives that can outshine it all! So let's get started:10. INFAMOUS IRON MANOriginally this spot went to Jessica Jones but after reading it's third issue, I have to say Infamous Iron Man did so much more in only three issues compared to Jessica Jones!This has to be one of Bendis' best books yet! It changes the status quo of an iconic character while still keeping true to who he is. Who would ever think Doctor Doom can be an awesome superhero? It's a got this dark and gritty art that sort of works with a Doctor Doom story, with all these twists and turns, I definitely see so much potential in this book! I recommend it!HONORABLE MENTION: JESSICA JONESAlso written by Bendis with art by Michael Gaydos (the original team, heck even original cover artist David Mack is back! Now that's consistency.) Jessica Jones returns after ten years without a book of her own and she's the booze-drinking, kick ass PI we all know and loved in the Netflix series!I loved this series, if you asked my two years ago, I would say I've never been fond of Jessica Jones but after Netflix and my hard research I realized  she's one of my favorite Marvel characters that I'm glad is getting involved again. Her book really continues stories that ended or began in Civil War II, and possibly Secret Wars! This is a fantastic book you need to check out!9. DEAD NO MORE: THE CLONE CONSPIRACYDan Slott and Christos Cage might've made the BEST clone story for Spider-Man, I've ever read! With help from artists such as Giuseppe Camuncoli, Dead No More, really brings out new twists, new villainous motivations, new villains in generals, and the dead returning but at a cost that has Spider-Man racing against time to stop the Jackal!Dead No More really sets the bar for a good clone story, because they're not entirely clones. It brings this question to Peter Parker and has him decide: if you could bring back someone, would you take that chance? I love how NOW Peter has to decide what to do, as he faces villains he's faced as well as people he's loved and loss now turned against him for the sake of survival. We got guest characters in Spider-Gwen, Prowler (getting his own book in the process), and the returning Scarlet Spider...can you guess which one I'm talking about :wink: ? Overall, a great event you need to check out!8. CIVIL WAR IIProtect the future or Change it? Brian Michael Bendis and David Marquez really dig into the philosophy of heroes having to choose a side that questions their morals. A young inhuman named Ulysses has the power to foresee a possible future and this has the Marvel Universe at each other throats! It's Captain Marvel (change) vs Iron Man (protect)! Young heroes become disillusioned with their mentors and idols, lines are crossed and the world will never be the same!Now I know what people are thinking, \"why is this on your list? I mean the poor characterizations, killing off beloved characters because why not? Ignoring tie-ins (Totally Awesome Hulk), Captain Marvel gets no love here! So why?\" Well aside from the fantastic art of David Marquez, the book succeeds in doing what it set out to do: it got people talking. We didn't stop talking about the deaths of War Machine, Bruce Banner, poor Jen and Miles, and soon Tony! Another is that compared to the first Civil War, this was more personal between certain characters only and focused on their thoughts something I have to commend. A problem I have, is  not the book but the delays almost hurting this book with series that take place after the massive event, spoiled the ending (Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Infamous Iron Man, & Invincible Iron Man, etc...) if he had no control over it, poor Bendis...despite the spoilers it did fantastic in it's mission, and it changed the marvel universe forever...divided we stand!7. CAPTAIN AMERICA: STEVE ROGERSHail Hydra! Words we'd never thought we hear from this patriotic hero and that it did! Nick Spencer also got attention for this book because of that first issue and maybe I'm in the minority, HydraCap might be some cash grab, but it's a good story that's entertaining me! Steve Rogers was restored to his youth thanks to Kobik, but this was the Red Skull's plan to rewrite his reality as an undercover Hydra Agent!With great art and good writing, Captain America: Steve Roger tells the story of Marvel Universe's biggest threat and they don't even know it! I think they don't have much to tell a story with Steve Rogers as Sam Wilson is handling the modern day issues of politics and all things PC, (not that SR isn't handling politics as well but it's probably overshadowed by HydraCap) this story really changes the way we know Steve and I can't wait for everyone to find out who he is! Hail Hydra indeed....6. AMAZING SPIDER-MAN: RENEW YOUR VOWSGerry Conway is back writing Spider-Man if \"One More Day\" didn't happened and boy, only two issues in is it something to behold! Taking place in the Secret Wars domain now a Universe of its own, Peter Parker marries Mary Jane Watson and have child of their own Annie who developed her own spider powers. After the battle with Regent, they now face new threats, for the adults? It's parenthood!Ok sure it sort of felt like Superman: Lois & Clark but it's benefit that it doesn't take place with them stranded in another universe but in their own world, facing new creative threats. It's such a great spider-book. This is another, maybe better way of showing Peter maturing and growing up comparing to Amazing Spider-Man which shows another way but for some it didn't feel right. This however, does.5. CHAMPIONS#Champions! Written by ANAD Avengers writer Mark Waid with art done by Humberto Ramos, continues the story of the young heroes following Civil War II. They're the young generation that feels the old one is no longer doing any good and it's time for them to take a stand. Members Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Nova, Viv Vision, Cyclops and the Totally Awesome Hulk become a force for good as they fight all new threatsWhat I love about Champions is that it isn't a super hero team, it's more than that. It's movement, a movement against prejudice, discrimination, and modern problems in the forms of villains or real life problems all over the world. It's truly something to behold. Sure Hulk seems out of character but everything else is just right! If you want a book with a strong message than this is for you!4. VisionTom King wrote a true masterpiece here as he ventured to Marvel for a while and wrote a true classic that will stand to the tests of time! Vision is about her titular synthezoid as he creates a family of his own to better understand humanity. Only him, his wife, and children are in for a much darker story.I never thought I'd feel for a book like Vision. The suspense, the chills, the feels, it had a heartwarming ending after such dark turns for certain characters. I really recommend this book if you're a Tom King fan, it's truly going to be a Marvel classic.3. ULTIMATESUltimates was always one of my top favorite comics of the All-New, All-Different Marvel comics. With beautiful art from Kenneth Rocafort, great guest appearance from Giant Man and didn't let Civil War II tie-ins hinder the book of its greatness, it's truly THE Avengers book.Al Ewing may not be Jonathan Hickman but he's possibly the next best thing! He knows which characters to choose from, like America Chavez, who got a big push since then! They were the ultimate team to solve the ultimate problems. One of them was Galactus who they changed his status quo from Devourer of Worlds to Lifebringer! I mean who does that?! Ewing, that's who! Rocafort's art is just gorgeous with it's visually stunning background and detail. Although Rocafort is no longer on the book and we got Travel Foreman (who's not as stellar but has his moments) Ultimates (2) isn't so bad, because the story is still the same good old awesomeness that Ewing brings. Truly the \"ULTIMATE\" book to check out!  2. MOON KNIGHTI was debating whether or Vision was going to be #2, but I'm not going to speak for the majority because for me #2 goes to Moon Knight for getting me into the character! It didn't take long for me to get sucked into Jeff Lemire's truly and gritty take on the character who is currently stuck in an asylum which may not be all that it seems. It's a fight against god's, and his own mind as Moon Knight has me sold!The transition of the many artists for Marc Spector's personalities is creative and feels as if they were different books entirely! The main artist is way better however as he has this dark, gritty and toned down look for the series that I just love. This really makes me want that Netflix series already! So pick this up, you might be entertained as much as I was!And my number one favorite Marvel book of 2016 is....1. INVINCIBLE IRON MANYea, only two issues in and this series has proven it's much a different take on Iron Man and I love it. After Iron Man's tragic death in Civil War II, Riri Williams takes the mantle as Ironheart and lives up a legacy and embraces her genius! But Tony isn't dead as per say, and becomes a helpful ally for the new hero.Dealing with Chicago violence, and problems of a teenager, Invincible Iron Man was such a wild concept that caused controversy and at the same time, support from others. I was looking for a story rather than listen to the supposed controversy surrounding it. And I got such a damn good book so far! It allows us to see who Riri is. Like Captain America: Steve Rogers, there's only so much you can do with Tony Stark, having been around for decades, I think this is the best thing for Iron Man. If you want a different take on Iron Man, with stellar art and fantastic writing, then please, check out my #1 favorite Marvel comic of 2016! Who knows, if it keeps going, it'll be my favorite comic of 2017!And Now for My Most Anticipated Comic (it's Tomorrow! Or today, depending when I'm posting this)HULKIts coming out tomorrow! I'm so excited to see a new take on She-Hulk! This might be the actual \"Hulk\" of the Marvel Universe, someone struggling with trauma, anger and their demons. Except unlike Banner, Jen was always able to control it, what happens when she can't anymore? I'm excited to read this!So those are my top 10 favorite Marvel Comics of this year! I loved reading these comics! I know there are others like Infamous Iron Man, Sam Wilson, or Avengers, but these are my top 10! Stay tuned because I got three more End of the Year posts plus my usual reviews. So have a great Tuesday! What are your favorite Marvel comics of this year?__________________________________[#Society][#Pantheons][#DefendersOfAmino][#DOAAllStar]Made an alteration to #10, a recent issue really made me see something better!Great list thanks for sharing the good marvel stories, Although the list is longer then This.

Disney and Marvel Studios' sweeping MCU propelled these characters to gargantuan new heights and helped the superhero genre's popularity in movies with it.RELATED: 10 Marvel Heroes Darker Than Their VillainsThe voting community at Ranker has compiled a top 10 list of the publisher's best heroes. Over the decades, these characters have either seen their legacies endure like Spider-Man and Wolverine, to others seeing strong surges in terms of mainstream appeal like Deadpool and Black Panther.Elizabeth Olsen's portrayal of Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch in the MCU has bolstered her reputation, and especially so with her and Vision's WandaVision series on Disney+, adding some intrigue to the universe. Being a mutant herself, her origins in the comics were tied from the start to the X-Men, making her debut in the '60s comic book series.Her character arcs in the comics have taken her from being a villain to a regular member of the Avengers along with the X-Men. Scarlet Witch's life has involved dramatic stories tied to Magneto, but it ended up leading her to revelations regarding her true lineage. She has plenty of ripe lore in the source material, making it interesting to speculate where Scarlet Witch will be taken in MCU's Phase Four and beyond.Black Panther is regarded by fans as one of 2018's best movies and a landmark in the MCU and superhero movie genre. He was the medium's first African superhero in his debut in the '60s and has now cemented his status as a pop-culture icon. T'Challa has a rich history in the comics spanning decades, with his stories varying in scope and settings such as Hell's Kitchen to outer space.Different comic arcs have focused on personal themes of T'Challa, and while the MCU tends to focus on grand Avengers-level storylines, Black Panther has gotten numerous grounded stories alongside the large-scale ones. These stories have been known to reach intimate levels on the scale of Daredevil or Spider-Man's comics.Steve Rogers as Captain America is another superhero that quickly comes to fans' minds when hearing Marvel's brand name. He's long since been established as one of the core members of the Avengers -- both in the MCU and comics. Captain America is also a fascinating character to explore social commentary, as his introduction came during World War II as a piece of propaganda to aid America's war effort.RELATED: 10 Best Comic-Accurate Costumes, RankedOver the decades, Captain America has been faced with challenges concerning his ideals and what it means to be \"patriotic.\" Rogers gradually became a more grounded, humanized character in tackling these kinds of ideas, and his \"everyman\" appeal is still strong today as it was 80 years ago when he was created.The Hulk is a classic flagship hero from Marvel's comics, and if reports are true, it appears he's finally getting another solo project in the MCU. He's another one of the legendary Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creations for the publisher and still stands as one of Marvel's strongest \"monster\" characters.Hulk had several genre-defining story arcs, including Planet Hulk and World War Hulk, with the latter rumored to influence the MCU project. Throughout the years, Hulk has undergone numerous transformations, from his \"savage\" persona in the 1970s to his \"smart\" persona in the '80s and '90s, that have kept his character fresh and vital throughout the decades. His current iteration in The Immortal Hulk draws heavily on his horror monster roots and is one of Marvel's most acclaimed titles.One of the more obscure but powerful magical characters, Doctor Strange has also been getting his due recognition as Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme. Strange is also one of the most intelligent heroes in the universe, with his origins focusing on an initial fall from grace and humbling.Being a talented but arrogant, egotistical surgeon, Strange undergoes a compelling soul-searching quest that started as a desperate attempt to heal his hands. His stories naturally explore the more mystical corners of the Marvel Universe, and things could take an exciting, more emphasized turn in that direction for the upcoming Multiverse of Madness.The Merc with a Mouth exploded into the mainstream with Ryan Reynolds' depiction in the movies, but he's been a fan-favorite in comic book circles before then. He's one of the most popular anti-heroes and cases of \"breaking the 4th wall\" in the superhero genre while being involved in wonderfully chaotic stories alongside Marvel's vast cast of characters.RELATED: 10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About DeadpoolDeadpool's dark, gory, and hilarious exploits have evolved into several memorable dynamics with the likes of Wolverine, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and even Captain America. With the raunchy charisma Deadpool has, it was only a matter of time before wider audiences fell in love with the character.In addition to being what's essentially the poster boy for the X-Men, Wolverine has a longstanding reputation in Marvel overall. Hugh Jackman's portrayal certainly helped, but from the movies back the comics, James \"Logan\" Howlett has a high standard of quality when it comes to storytelling. He's prime for the gritty noir narratives Marvel wants to tell with the \"tragic hero\" element to him.Wolverine's immense strength and durability come at the cost of having to outlive several of his loved ones, growing cynical and jaded in the process. Arcs like Weapon X show the hero's dark beginnings and highlight how much he's grown along the way, and other fan-favorites like Old Man Logan expertly mix comic book absurdity with emotional impact.Thor in the comics was also a founding member of the Avengers, but he's become a character known for going through notable growth. Humanizing a literal god is a tough task for any writer, but his mythos and the several creative teams involved have succeeded in creating a God of Thunder that can come down to Earth and feel human.Modern comics have done him continued justice, with story arcs like Godbomb blending the epic-scale action and art worthy of being Norse-inspired along with some psychological character studies. Throwing three incarnations of Thor against one of Marvel's best comic villains, Gorr the God Butcher, served as a thrilling backdrop for this.Nick Fury was the in-universe architect for establishing the MCU's Avengers, but Robert Downey Jr.'s inspired take on Iron Man was the spark. Iron Man was also a fairly obscure superhero outside of comic book circles, but from a mix of years of development in the comics and the movies shining a spotlight on him, he's also grown into a memorable character in the source medium.RELATED: 10 Most Powerful Variants Of Iron Man In Marvel ComicsIn the last decade, star comic writers like Matt Fraction (of Hawkeye fame) and Kieron Gillen made the hero accessible for new fans looking to see what they may have missed. These writers helped modernize Iron Man by emphasizing relatable flaws such as his traumatic childhood or struggles with alcoholism while still introducing fun and exciting characters like Ironheart, who is poised to succeed Tony as Marvel's armored Avenger.It's no surprise that fans voted Spider-Man as Marvel's best superhero. Well outside of Ranker, the Wall-Crawler has already firmly established himself as the world's most popular and highest-grossing individual superhero IP, with only Batman coming close.He was Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's magnum opus, striking an excellent balance of a bonafide action hero that inspires good, and a down-to-earth, flawed, and relatable young man that's just trying to do good with the hand he was dealt. Whether grieving the death of Gwen Stacy or saving the world in such iconic storylines as Secret Wars and Civil War, Spider-Man has been the central figure in the Marvel Universe and continues to be in numerous comics, films, television shows, and video games.NEXT: The Best Non-Superhero Characters In Spider-Man ComicsGuillermo Kurten is a journalism major at the University of Houston.

Try one of our products today and save 10% on your entire order!The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a rich and colorful world, with many interesting characters that people love… or love to hate. Here, we list the best characters in the Marvel Universe, judging them based on their character development and personality.  Tony Stark has flaws that make him relatable. He starts as an arrogant engineer kidnapped by a syndicate who wanted him to create a deadly weapon. Instead of giving the syndicate what they wanted, Tony Stark created a suit to help him escape. He became Iron Man and the founding member of the Avengers with the help of Nick Fury. In Endgame, his character arc comes full circle when he performs the ultimate sacrifice, which was to become a suit of armor to the world.  Peter Parker was only in high school when he got bit by a radioactive spider, making him one of the youngest Marvel heroes in the Marvel Universe. Spider-Man can shoot webs and climb walls vertically. The young hero is optimistic yet quite reckless. He fights bad guys with a laugh… yet still can’t muster enough courage to ask his crush MJ out. Read: Top 50 Marvel Gifts Professor X was born a telepath who can control and influence other people’s minds. He founded a school for gifted young people aptly named Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters in the Marvel Universe and taught confused and frightened mutants how best to use their powers. Notable alumni include Marvel characters like Jean Grey and Cyclops.  Thor wields the mighty Mjolnir, making him one of the strongest Marvel characters. He is the son of Odin and Earth-goddess Gaea, making him a powerful yet arrogant hybrid god of Asgard. Odin makes him learn the value of humility. He has him exiled to Earth, where he begins life as a doctor named Donald Blake alongside nurse Jane Foster. When his father discovers his profound changes, he asks him to come home, but Thor refuses. He loses his weapon and arm while fighting villains in both realms but doesn’t lose his drive to become one of the most powerful characters. Read: Thor vs Captain Marvel When Steve Rogers first volunteered to defend America in World War Two, he was rejected due to his scrawny physique. He was, however, chosen to become a participant in an experiment called “Project: Rebirth.” Little did he know that this was a trial to create super soldiers by using a serum to grant them immensely powerful superhuman strength. He becomes a secret soldier of the country and dons a red, white, and blue costume, thus becoming the hero Captain America. He is best friends with Bucky Barnes, who becomes the Winter Soldier. He strongly upholds wanting to do what is right all the time… even if it means fighting against his teammates in Avengers: Civil War. Also Read: Red Guardian vs Captain America Natasha Romanoff was trained as an agent under the Black Widow Program. As a longtime opponent of the Avengers, Hawkeye was sent to get rid of her… but he saved her instead. Completely turning her back on her old life, Black Widow becomes a member of both the Avengers and SHIELD. She didn’t lose her torturous ways, though, preferring to use brutality against villains. In Endgame, the female hero seeks redemption for her past misdeeds and sacrifices herself to bring back those lost. Read: When Does Black Widow Take Place in the MCU Timeline As far as she could remember, Jean Grey, aka Phoenix, has always had telekinetic abilities. She is one of the founding members of the X-men and is an instructor at Professor X’s school. She is extremely compassionate and always puts other people first. She believes in peace and hopes that humans and mutants will be able to coexist without prejudice one day. Read: Marvel vs DC What happened to Chadwick Boseman was unfortunate, but his performance as T’Challa in the Black Panther movie paved the way for heroes and cultures of African American origin. Black Panther is a title that is passed down to the King of Wakanda. The black and silver suit is made from vibranium, one of the strongest elements in the Marvel universe. He is one of the greatest heroes, always ready to defend Wakanda against anyone who threatens to disrupt its peace.Read: Top 45 Marvel Quotes Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, was initially a supervillain on Team Magneto. She wields incredible power and can even be the strongest in the entire Marvel Universe. She realizes that she is fighting for the wrong team and joins our heroes. She is incredibly caring to those important to her and is devoted to protecting innocents. Read: How Long Would It Take to Watch All MCU Movies Ant-Man starts as an antihero… after all, Scott Lang spent some time in prison before becoming the bite-sized hero. He was personally recommended by Falcon to become an official member of the Avengers and helped in obtaining the Infinity Stones from the micro-universe. He is a good guy and is always pushing himself to try new things.  Falcon is extremely loyal to Captain America. In fact, he was personally chosen by Captain himself to carry his shield when he made the decision to retire to a past timeline. In the Marvel comic books, he becomes Captain America himself. Sam Wilson worked in the United States Air Force before joining the Avengers. He is a powerful war machine on wings whose reliability makes him one of the best Marvel heroes.  For some reason, Thanos spared Gamora when he wiped her entire species out. He raised her like a daughter and trained her to become a deadly assassin. Because of this, Gamora knew Thanos better than anyone else, and she showed bravery and willingness to do whatever it took to bring him down, even if it meant sacrificing her own life. Read: Marvel Painting Ideas & Tips Stephen Strange starts as an obnoxious surgeon who came to his senses after a car accident rendered him useless. Desperate to find a solution, he dabbled in voodoo and visited the Ancient One in the East. The Ancient One didn’t only restore his skills but also taught the character mysticism and magic (and a bit of humility). He eventually becomes a member of the Avengers and in their fights against villains. Read: Best Way To Watch Marvel Movies Born on Earth but raised in Space, half-human Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, spearheaded the Guardians of the Galaxy. This treasure hunter is devious and cheeky, but deep down, he is extremely sentimental about things he cares for. Don’t believe us? Get this: the heroes would’ve easily won the first time they faced Thanos if it weren’t for his emotions over Gamora’s death in Infinity War.  Although Hawkeye is deadly when he’s armed with his bow and arrow, he’s obviously the weakest among the Marvel superheroes. Clint Barton is a family man, putting his wife and kids above everything. He understands that the world needs him… but his family needs him more.  Wolverine is an integral part of X-men. He was born a sickly kid in the 1880s until his powers manifested and bone claws came out of his knuckles. He eventually got recruited by Professor X. While Wolverine favors action over reason, his heart remains in the right place. It also wouldn’t hurt for him to tone down the violence once in a while.  The green-skinned Hulk is a powerful hero that can crush everything he gets his palms on. Bruce Banner wasn’t always this way, though. After the accidental explosion of a gamma bomb, the physicist gets exposed to radiation and discovers that he could turn green and strong when he gets angry. Bruce loathes himself for being unable to control the monster inside him and hopes to find a way to guide his alter-ego in the right direction.  When Galactus came to his planet to devour it, Norrin Rodd offered himself as herald instead. Galactus took him up on his offer and granted him powers, which turned him silver and indestructible, as well as a surfboard so that he may search the universe at the speed of light. He lost his memory in the process. He met the Fantastic Four heroes who helped him rediscover his old self when he landed on Earth. With the help of the Fantastic Four, he managed to defeat Galactus.  Matt Murdock was bullied because his father wanted him to stay home and study instead of roughhousing out in the streets. His kind heart led him to save an oblivious blind man crossing the street towards an oncoming truck. The truck crashed, and its contents — which turned out to be a radioactive isotope — spilled out and blinded Matt but granted him superhuman senses. Daredevil is a lawyer by day and at the same time a crimefighter at night and sees helping innocents as a personal duty.  After being exposed to the Tesseract, US Air Force pilot Carol Danvers obtained cosmic powers, making her one of the strongest heroes in the entire Marvel universe. However, she lost all memory of being Carol Danvers after the Kree kidnapped her. During a chance landing on Earth, she had glimpses of her past life and discovered that the Kree was using her all along. Captain Marvel is one of the strongest Marvel heroes, although she doesn’t like answering to anyone. Read: Captain Marvel vs Ms MarvelWe’re not sure why people hate Captain Marvel. Perhaps it’s the way the character is portrayed as being quite cocky? Or perhaps they don’t like the way Brie Larson plays her? Either way, people think she took up way too much screen time for someone who is fairly new to the franchise. In an online poll [1], heroes Iron Man and Captain America tied for the favorite Avenger spot. It’s no wonder these two are on top as they are extremely charismatic characters portrayed by effective actors. The Marvel Universe is a complex world with thousands of different characters in the MCU movies, each with their unique personalities.If you’re a fan of the universe, check out our Marvel merch at Toynk.  Reference:1. https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/iron-man-captain-america-voted-favorite-avengersConnecting people with their favorite pop-culture products every day.\n",

      "Best Comics of 2020 (So Far): Marvel ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — Now that we’re roughly a quarter of the way into 2020, we thought it’d be fun to start taking a look at the best comics of 2020 so far, starting with far and away the most prolific comics publisher — Marvel Comics.  To that end, below you will find a list of the best comics of 2020 from Marvel so far, with extra attention given to whether a series is easy for new or lapsed readers to hop onto, pick-up, or just generally understand.So yeah, Marvel list is below, and we’ll be rolling out similar best comics of 2020 (so far) lists for DC Comics, Image Comics, and a number of other publishers in the weeks and months to come...enjoy!This is a section for readers who want to get involved with Marvel’s current crop of monthly comic books, and as such, it only includes titles that are coming out monthly right here, right now. Some (as we’ll note below) may require some trade reading to catch-up on, but these are the best of the best, so it’s worth it.1. X-MenWriter: Jonathan HickmanMain Series Artist: Leinil Francis Yu (primarily)Most Recent Issue (as of publication): X-Men #8Next Issue: X-Men #9 is due out March 25, 2020Why Is This So Good: The hottest thing at Marvel Comics in 2020 (so far) is the X-Men line. You can make a case (and we will) for Immortal Hulk being a better comic, but nothing is doling out the fully immersive, high-concept mosaic of stories that make superhero periodicals so unique, like X-Men. Within the X-Men line, however, it can be tough to know what to read. So let’s get to it.X-Men is the flagship title for a linewide X-Men reinvention project undertaken by mad superhero comics mastermind Jonathan Hickman and a wide range of very talented collaborators. There is an overarching new world for the X-Titles to now play in, but the guide through the most important matters of that world is the X-Men main title, which mostly features stand-alone episodes, making it more accessible than basically any other title on this list.Relevant Trades: No matter what you do, you’ll need to read House of X / Powers of X HC to gain a base understanding of the new X-Men status quo. Past that, you have two options. You can read just the collected issues of the X-Men flagship title when that collection hits in April, or you can read trades that collect the entire line, issue by issue, with Dawn of X 1, Dawn of X 2, and Dawn of X 3.Special Note: While the X-Men flagship title is the only true must read and the main event here, basically all of the auxiliary titles have been strong too (with one exception). The solo titles for Wolverine and Cable both exceeded my expectations. Past that, Marauders is a really well done mutants-at-sea (hear me out!) comic that tackles the geopolitical economic implications of the new status quo, while X-Force is very good too and does the same for national security. X-Men/Fantastic Four has the best small story of the bunch (it’s about family strife because young Franklin Richards is a mutant), while the other must-read title here, to my mind, is Giant-Sized X-Men, which is an artist showcase miniseries that sees lead X-Men writer Jonathan Hickman collaborating with some of the publisher’s best superhero artists. 2. Immortal HulkWriter: Al EwingMain Series Artist: Joe BennettMost Recent Issue: Immortal Hulk #32Next Issue: Immortal Hulk #33 is due out March 25Why Is This So Good: While X-Men might be the buzziest franchise at Marvel in 2020, the best individual book is Immortal Hulk. First launched back in June 2018, this is a rare superhero comic that has gotten better and better and better as it has gone. It has a consistent creative team, and it has reached fluidly throughout the Hulk’s long history (all of these characters have long histories now) to find new opportunities to tell haunting stories. Somewhere between an action romp and a horror fest, Immortal Hulk is Marvel’s best individual book in 2020.Relevant Trades: Immortal Hulk Vols. 1 - 6, are all available now, and they will get you right up to Immortal Hulk #303. AvengersWriter: Jason AaronMain Series Artist: Ed McGuinness Most Recent Issue: Avengers #32Next Issue: Avengers #33 is due out Why Is This So Good: Marvel relaunched its flagship team superhero title back in May of 2018, bringing back a lineup that should be familiar to those who mostly just know the Marvel movies (plus also She-Hulk and Ghost Rider). The book got off to a rocky start with a first arc that felt a little bloated and prolonged, but once it found its groove, it’s been stellar ever since. There’s so much going on in this comic, so many good ideas that really play to the inherent absurdities of large-scale superheroics. It’s a great monthly read, and the third best comic at Marvel right now.Relevant Trades: Avengers by Jason Aaron Vols. 1 - 5 will take you up through Avengers #25, with Avengers Vol. 6 due May 6.4. DaredevilWriter: Chip ZdarskyMain Series Artist: Marco ChecchettoMost Recent Issue: Daredevil #19Next Issue: Daredevil #20 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Daredevil is almost always good, so well-built is this character and mythos that roughly a half-dozen writers have done career-best work on the character, including Frank Miller, Ann Nocenti, Brian Michael Bendis, Ed Brubaker, Mark Waid/Chris Samnee, and most recently Charles Soule. The current Chip Zdarsky/Marco Checchetto run is no exception, ranking as one of the best monthly comics at Marvel right now.Relevant Trades: Daredevil by Chip Zdarsky Vols. 1 - 2 will take you up through Daredevil #10, with Daredevil Vol. 3 due out in April.5. Doctor DoomWriter: Christopher CantwellMain Series Artist: Salvador LaroccaMost Recent Issue: Doctor Doom #6Next Issue: Doctor Doom #7 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Christopher Cantwell is such a powerful writer that he’s bringing out the best of Salvador Larocca on this book, which is a tale about Doom confronting a prophecy that under the right circumstances he could save the entire world...but at the same time he’s also being framed for a heinous act of terrorism. This entire series has been fantastic. For a taste of what you’re in for, consider that Doctor Doom #6 earlier this month was like the film Paris, Texas...just with Doom and Kang the Conqueror walking and chatting their way through a desert together. Look, I know how it all sounds but this comic is excellent.Relevant Trades: Doctor Doom Vol. 1 is due March 25, collecting #1 - #56. Ant-ManWriter: Zeb WellsMain Series Artist: Dylan BurnettMost Recent Issue: Ant-Man #3Next Issue: Ant-Man #4 is due out April 1Why Is This So Good: Look, this series is hilarious...and I don’t even generally like superhero comics that try to be funny. If you don’t believe check out my review of Ant-Man #1 for a longer and (hopefully) more thoughtful argument, and then when you’re done with that check out this weekly feature about some of the funniest panels in Ant-Man #2. If that’s still not enough, let me also advise you that in Ant-Man #3, there’s a scene where Ant-Man refers to Spider-Man as “Captain Dad Joke.” In other words, this book is a blast, and it’s the best light read at Marvel right now. Relevant Trades: None yet7. Marvel’s Teen Superhero ComicsThe Magnificent Ms. MarvelWriter: Saladin AhmedMain Series Artist: Minkyu JungMost Recent Issue: The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #13Next Issue: The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #14 is due out April 1Relevant Trades: Ms. Marvel by Saladin Ahmed Vols. 1 - 2, with 2 due out April 1, collects up through The Magnificent Ms. Marvel #12Miles Morales: Spider-ManWriter: Saladin AhmedMain Series Artist: Javi GarronMost Recent Issue: Miles Morales Spider-Man #16Next Issue: Miles Morales Spider-Man #17 is due out April 1Relevant Trades: Miles Morales Spider-Man Vols. 1 - 2, collects up through #10Why These Are So Good: By having the excellent writer Saladin Ahmed take on Marvel’s two most prominent teen heroes, the publisher has fostered a sort of continuity among its teen line, and it’s working very well. At the same time, writer Eve L. Ewing is coming on to take over the main teen hero team book, Champions, next month with artist Simone Di Meo, and that book features both Miles and Kamala. Ewing did great work on the RiRi Williams Ironheart series that wrapped up last year, giving Marvel’s line of teen titles a very bright future indeed.8. ThorWriter: Donny CatesMain Series Artist: Nic KleinMost Recent Issue: Thor #4Next Issue: Thor #5 is due out April 8Relevant Trades: None yetWhy Is This So Good: I’ve had a bit of a hangover since Jason Aaron concluded his EPIC run with Thor, but this new one by writer Donny Cates and artist Nic Klein has been pretty bombastic (much like Cates work with Thanos that helped him break-out as a star at Marvel). It also gets extra points on our list here today because you can easily pick-up all four issues to date and get caught up with this one quick. Oh, and expect lots of Galactus! If you find yourself like this book, Cates’ run on Venom may be to your liking as well, though I’m not as enamored with that as am with Cates Marvel cosmic stories.Honorable Mentions: Amazing Spider-Man (when not bogged down with crossovers), Black Panther, Captain America, Captain Marvel, Conan the Barbarian, Guardians of the Galaxy, Runaways, Valkyrie: Jane Foster, Venom.This next section is dedicated to recent trade collections newly available in 2020 that more casual Marvel comics readers can pick-up (or buy digitally online) and enjoy today. I highly recommend this entire list, all of which can just be picked up and enthusiastically dove into with little knowledge of anything else going on. There is, it should be noted, some overlap with the trade recommendations noted above, as is to be expected.Black Bolt HCMore InformationHistory of the Marvel Universe - Treasury EditionMore InformationHouse of X / Powers of X HCMore InformationImmortal Hulk Vol. 1 HCMore InformationInvaders Vol. 1 & Vol. 2More Information Vol. 1More Information Vol. 2Ironheart Vol. 1 & Vol. 2More Information Vol. 1More Information Vol. 2Punisher Kill KrewMore InformationFinally, a note about the future...as I pointed out in the intro, we’ll be doing this for a number of other publishers in the months and weeks to come.

      "Best Comics of 2022 (So Far): Marvel ComicsAll manner of writing about comic booksBy Zack Quaintance — We’ve reached (roughly) the 1/4 through the year mark (very roughly), and as such, we’re starting our annual tradition: ranking the best comics of 2022 (so far). Each Friday through the end of the month, we’ll have a new list. Today’s is the best comics of 2022 — Marvel Comics. On the Fridays to come, we’ll soon have lists as well for DC Comics, Image Comics, and just generally indie comics.And hey, we’re also doing things just a little bit differently this year. I’m going to stick with these lists and update them in real time as more books arrive, right up through October. So if you like what you find here, make sure to bookmark it and check back periodically through the rest of the year. Anyway! The best comics of 2022 Marvel are below…enjoy!1. Iron ManWriter: Christopher CantwellPrimary Artist: CafuMost Recent Trade: Iron Man, Vol. 2 - Books of Korvac IIWhy This Is So Good: Holy cow, where to start? This current run of Iron Man — which is a manageable two trades long at the time of this writing — is the ideal of what I want from my superhero comics. First and foremost, it’s character driven, like all of Christopher Cantwell’s comics tend to be. Rather than deploying a quip machine Tony Stark like we see in the movies, this book really looks at Tony’s psychology, drawing it instead from his long history in the comics. It tackles his roots as Iron Man, his drinking problem, his troubles with relationships, and it tackles it well. There’s plenty of big superhero fighting (we’ll get into it) and sci-fi hi jinx (we’ll get into that too) in these pages, but it’s all driven by emotional complexity.That said, in between that intense examination, it’s also a total romp of a sci-fi superhero adventure comic that draws from deep cuts in Marvel continuity. We see Tony assembling a B (or C…or even D) list team of superheroes, we see him taking them to space, and we see him squaring off with an equally-matched villain from the Avengers past in ways that will give you vibes of Star Trek: The Original Series. It’s really smart and hard to predict, and it’s the best use of Iron Man I’ve seen in a comic in years, if not decades. Finally, it’s all brought to life by Cafu, who has a true knack for nailing the big moments here, the giant explosions, and larger-than-life squaring off between titans. Cafu can do that stuff, for sure, but in this comic he’s also demonstrated a real knack for action storytelling choreography, making big fights clear in a way that heightens the stakes. Simply put, this is just a very good comic, one that delivers an experience with superhero characters that’s so complex and steeped in ideas, it would be hard to pull off in any other medium. Please please please read this book.Other Relevant Trades: Iron Man, Vol. 1 TPB2. The ThingWriter: Walter MosleyPrimary Artist: Tom ReillyMost Recent Trade: Pre-order The Thing: Next Big Thing, due out August 23, 2022Why This Is So Good: The first thing that is likely to grab you in this six-part story centered on the Fantastic Four’s The Thing, is the artwork. Tom Reilly (who is getting ready to do a similar limited series starring Ant Man Men) has some of the cleanest linework in all of superhero comics. There’s something in both his character designs and storytelling that is likely to remind you of The Thing’s creator, Jack Kirby. Just an excellent love of the medium and the creative eye to do it justice. It’s really astounding work.And when paired with novelist Walter Mosley’s clear love for the character? Well, the results are fantastic. This series is an absolute blast from start to finish, one that captures the self-aware absurdity of superhero comics perfectly, without at all looking down on them and instead preferring to just have some fun (although not without the conflict and drama). That’s what this book delivers. It’s smart, it’s funny, it’s engaging, and it feels truly special. I can’t recommend it enough.Other Relevant Trades: The Thing Classic, Vol. 1 - Digital / Physical; The Thing Classic, Vol. 2 - Digital / Physical3. DaredevilWriter: Chip ZdarskyPrimary Artist: Marco ChecchettoMost Recent Trade: Daredevil by Chip Zdarsky, Vol. 7 Lockdown - Physical / DigitalWhy This Is So Good: If there is one thing that Marvel Comics has consistently done well over the years, it’s to make sure that Daredevil is always a top-tier superhero comics reading experience. Often times, this means that the book is eliciting career-best work from its creative team (see Frank Miller, Ann Nocenti, Brian Michael Bendis & David Mack/Alex Maleev, Mark Waid & Chris Samnee, the list goes on…). This is certainly true of the current run of Daredevil.The run by Chip Zdarsky (soon to be the writer of the flagship Batman title for DC Comics) and artist Marco Checcetto, has been a slow-burning and complex examination of the functions of laws, authorities, and power structures in a modern city. Checchetto’s artwork is moody and engaging, with more than subtle hints of classic noir. And Zdarsky is making plenty of excellent choices with the story, which centers thematically on the nature of accountability. It’s a long run, one of the longest on our Best Comics of 2022 - Marvel Comics list, but it’s well worth the investment to get caught up now. The seven trade collections that are currently available lead right into the currently-ongoing Devil’s Reign event story.Other Relevant Trades: Vol 1 - Physical / Digital; Vol 2 - Physical / Digital; Vol 3 - Physical / Digital; Vol 4 - Physical / Digital; Vol 5 - Physical / Digital; and Vol 6 - Physical / Digital4. SabretoothWriter: Victor LaVallePrimary Artist: Leonard KirkMost Recent Trade: Pre-order Sabretooth - The Adversary, due out August 9, 2022Why This Is So Good: Novelist Victor LaValle brings his keen sensibility for horror that speaks to our times to the line of X-Men comics, and none too soon. As of this writing, the X-Men books are sort of stuck in an in-between place spanning the departure of House of X/Powers of X mastermind, Jonathan Hickman, and a new era that will spring from the ideas he and his collaborators have shaped over the past two years or so. Yet, as we await that new era, perhaps the best new comic of current era has arrived, in which LaValle and his collaborators take aim at a society that is striving to be a utopia…while still throwing its members into a prison, of sorts. Many writers have spun ideas out of the Krakoa concept that Hickman set up, but this is far and away the most intriguing. And all you need to jump into it is to have read House of X/Powers of X (see link below…).Other Relevant Trades: House of X/Powers of X HC5. Moon KnightWriter: Jed MacKayPrimary Artist: Alessandro CappuccioMost Recent Trade: Moon Knight, Vol. 1 - The Midnight Mission - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: If Daredevil is consistently the favorite, prestige son of Marvel Comics, Moon Knight is his more mysterious cousin, a place where creators have often gone to tell weirdo stories that challenge perceptions and maybe even deliberately confuse. This current run is not as disorienting as others have been as of late, but it’s still a really good use of the character to take a romp through the Marvel Universe’s street level instances of monsters and the occult. The artwork is suitably moody, and writer Jed MacKay is a natural at telling accessible and fast-moving superhero stories. If you have had your interest in this character sparked by the upcoming TV show, the current comic also has a lot to offer.Other Relevant Trades: See our guide on where to start with Moon Knight6. Miles Morales: Spider-ManWriter: Saladin AhmedPrimary Artist: Michele BandiniMost Recent Trade: Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 7 Beyond - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: This is the best Spider-Man comic right now. Granted, we have a new Amazing Spider-Man #1 launching in April, but for the moment, Miles Morales: Spider-Man is definitely where you want to get your Spider-Man fix. It’s a Spider-Man comic that is taking risks and going to new places, adding characters and introducing villains that all feel fresh and interesting. It’s also liable to remind readers of the beloved teenage Spider-Man years, the struggles to date and go to school and balance being a hero with family. Like Daredevil, it’s one of the longer runs on the best comics of 2022 Marvel list, but the creative team expertly playing the long game with the ideas here makes this one well worth the lengthy trip.Other Relevant Trades: Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 1 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 2 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 3 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 4 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 5 Digital / Physical; Miles Morales - Spider-Man Vol. 6 Digital / Physical7. Ghost RiderWriter: Benjamin PercyPrimary Artist: Cory SmithMost Recent Trade: Ghost RiderWhy This Is So Good: You can read all about it in my recent Ghost Rider #1 review, but I was caught off guard with how much I ended up liking this comic. In brief, it’s a simple and chilling horror comic with touches of the characters mythos throughout. From page one, this book is doing so many interesting things with tone and minimalism and ambiance, and it really carries throughout the entirety of the over-sized first chapter. If this comic continues to be this good as it gets deeper into its run (be forewarned, we so far only have the first issue), than I can definitely see it’s position changing (and for the better) later in the year on this very list of the best comics of 2022 Marvel edition. Anyway, highly recommend checking out Ghost Rider #1, which you just might enjoy even if you’re not traditionally a fan of the character.8. Captain MarvelWriter: Kelly ThompsonPrimary Artist: Jacopo CamagniMost Recent Trade: Captain Marvel Vol. 7 Last of the Marvels - Digital / PhysicalWhy This Is So Good: The third (and final) long run on our list, Captain Marvel has been a sneakily (is that a word?) excellent title since its start, actually (for my money) getting better after it found its footing with its earliest arcs. It’s doing a lot of interesting things with its supporting cast, and, increasingly, with the Marvel cosmic mythos that surrounds Carol Danvers. If you’re interested in this character, it’s a great book to really sink your teeth into, and I think one that’s relatively friendly for folks who haven’t read too many other Captain Marvel comics.Other Relevant Trades: Captain Marvel Vol. 1 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 2 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 3 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 4 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 5 - Digital / Physical; Captain Marvel Vol. 6 - Digital / PhysicalThis section is dedicated to recent trade collections newly available in 2022. I highly recommend this entire list, almost all of which can be picked up by new or lapsed readers and enjoyed on its own merits.

While it’s far from a slam dunk, 2018’s “Fresh Start” helped Marvel feel less aimless and more consistent. Plus, the 2019 event initiatives are genuinely exciting, whether it’s War of the Realms, Jonathan Hickmen’s X-Men, or Absolute Carnage.Below you’ll find my favorite Marvel Comics of 2019!Marvel Fresh StartAge of X-ManWar of the RealmsComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Support CBH on Patreon for exclusive rewards, or Donate here! Thank you for reading!Become a Patron!House of X / Hickman’s X-MenAbsolute CarnageIt took three issues for me to become a believer, but the moment Nnedi Okorafor and Leanordo Romero strapped Shuri in to pilot Groot I knew the series was willing to tap into the sci-fi oddities that would set it above the rest.Post MCU Black Panther Shuri is destined for greatness, so here’s hoping Marvel Comics can lead the charge rather than follow the MCU’s lead again.I am deeply skeptical of writers and artists touching the character of Thanos unless they’re named (creator) Jim Starlin. This irrational stance has become less tenable over the past three years as the likes of Jeff Lemire, Mike Deodato, Donny Cates, Geoff Shaw, and now Tini Howard and Ariel Olivetti all clearly displayed skill and promise with the mad titan.“Zero Sanctuary” had the potential for a particularly egregious 2019 Avengers: Endgame tie-in, but instead flashes back to Thanos finding Gamora and bringing her aboard his pirate ship of mercenary and Black Order. It’s an intriguing look at the early days of these characters that are so well-established in the Marvel Universe today, and connects effortlessly to Starlin’s own stories from the cosmic glory days of the mid 1970’s.I’m consistently more into the Ta-Nehisi Coates era of Black Panther than many comics critics, and many of the same critiques can be levied against Coates early run on Captain America. Coates likes to take his time and build not only worlds but philosophies and themes. This can lead to books that feel like they progress too slowly or aren’t going anywhere, but more often than not – for me at least – it adds though-provoking layers of conversation between the respite of Captain America v Taskmaster.Since launch as part of “Fresh Start,” Cap by Coates and Leinil Francis Yu feels back, clearly paying tribute to the work of Brubaker and Epting while responding in earnest to the controversial events of Secret Empire. It’s this last piece that I particularly respect, as Coates is truly engaged with unpacking the all too pertinent metaphor behind the debasement of the American dream. Blended together with Yu’s consistent status as one of the best Marvel artists for over a decade, and Captain America is one of 2019’s best.As a huge fan of Jason Aaron’s extended Thor run, I’ve wanted to meet War of the Realms with more rapturous excitement, but instead find it merely “good.” Like a lot of The Mighty Thor, the art team of Russell Dautermann and Matt Wilson frequently transform the mundane into the transcendent, and elevate this event to an easy “best since Secret Wars” pedestal.The Donny Cates written Venom would likely have shot further up my top 10 but for the notable descent into War of the Realms tie-in purgatory. It’s like considering Kawhai Leonard for MVP – maybe he’d have gotten votes without the commitment to managing his minutes you know? (And to extend the parallel it follows that Absolute Carnage won the NBA Finals of event opening issues as a result.)Venom has been building to the events of Absolute Carnage since launch alongside Marvel Fresh Start in May 2018, and the payoff is generally worth it. Ryan Stegman and JP Mayer deliver some of the absolute best work in their careers in the main event issues, particularly the oversized issue one which is seriously one of the best event openers I’ve read across either of the Big 2.Absolute Carnage actually helped Venom course correct as well, setting the stage for a big 2020 for everyone in the book, from Eddie Brock to his son Dylan to The Maker!While it will go down as the weird Marvel event that bridged the gap between X-Men before and after Jonathan Hickman, Age of X-Man has been consistently interesting. The event commits with admirable audacity to really exploring the concepts of Utopia and isolation, with the “Xtremists” five issue miniseries finding the most fertile ground for extended metaphor.This is my first time reading an extended stretch of comics by writer Leah Williams, and her work developing a forbidden romance between The Blob and Psylocke is genuinely remarkable. If you’re going to explore any of the Age of X-Man miniseries, the Xtremists is my favorite by far.Marvel’s Dawn of X is a fascinating new era for the X-Men, and Gerry Duggan and Matteo Lolli’s Marauders is my favorite early series in this World of X.Ask me what happened in Silver Surfer Black and off hand I’ll likely mutter something even less intelligible than usual about Knull vs the Silver Surfer and the birth of Galactus. Ask what I think of the 5 issue miniseries, though, and I’ll just start screaming “TRADD MOORE” until you politely tell the authorities “No, I don’t know him.”Silver Surfer Black is an astonishingly gorgeous work with Moore dreaming up cosmic realms without boundaries, and a liquid streak of Norrin Radd like I haven’t enjoyed him since Slott and Allred wrapped up their run. This is a roadmap for the ambition artists should strive towards on any true Marvel Cosmic work.If you had told me at the start of 2019 that an Invaders comic would be among my favorite Marvel books of the year, I’d have spit on your crocs. Harsh but true, as I’ve never had much affinity for Marvel’s WWII relics (unless told via flashback during the Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting Captain America days).Chip Zdarsky and Butch Guice change that with an Invaders story centered around the recent heel turn of Namor the Sub-Mariner. This is without question my favorite use of Namor since the Hickman Avengers days, and the book does excellent work blending Marvel history with present day threats without swelling up and rotting on the shore.Given how good it’s been since launch, I find myself taking Runaways for granted far too often. Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka have recaptured all the magic of the Brian K. Vaughn and Adrian Alphona creation, really without any missteps along the way.Amazingly, Runaways is also the longest running series on my favorites of 2019 list, which probably says more about Marvel’s constant refreshes than anything, but still, consistency by a creative team!The premise for Spider-Man Life Story is familiar territory (works like George R.R. Martin’s Tom Tudbury stories in Wild Cards are my favorite example of a “realistically” aging Peter Parker), which makes it all the more important that Chip Zdarsky and company execute near perfectly. Each issue of “Life Story” condenses the history of Spider-Man one decade at a time, but in a universe where Peter’s actually in his 50’s by the time the 2000’s roll around.“Life Story” is particularly compelling if you’re familiar with Spidey’s deep comic book history (perhaps through a chronological reading club like My Marvelous Year), but this story will stand on its own for new readers for a good long while.Meet the Skrulls desperately wants to be Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta’s Vision, which can work as either a cruel critique, or a celebration of ambition. I chose to embrace the ambition, and love the sinister spy family tones of the Robbie Williams written five issue miniseries. Meet the Skrulls is particularly impressive given the launch in line with the MCU’s Captain Marvel, and the fact that the entire project could have easily fallen into the trappings of movie tie-in mundanity.The debut of the Skrulls in the MCU has meant a corresponding resurgence in the pages of Marvel Comics, most consistently reflecting Secret Invasion fallout (over a decade after the event concluded!). Meet the Skrulls taps into this idea of leftover agents of the infiltration living out the American dream, like The Americans with funnier chins. Much like Vision, though, Meet the Skrulls is a book about family before it’s a book about superheroes and villains, and it’s this heart that brings it to higher levels.I’ve been a fan of Chip Zdarsky since reading his pitch-perfect plan for Watchmen 2, but it’s still been amazing to watch his rise from hilarious Sex Criminals co-creator to top 5 Marvel Universe storyteller.Daredevil cements the fact that Zdarsky’s not a joke writer, he’s just a writer. The opening arc connects heavily (and new reader friendly-ery… speaking of writers…) to themes from Netflix’s Daredevil season three, and leans into Matt Murdock’s struggles with faith. It also features one of the best Daredevil and Punisher moments in memory!Amazingly, this is only the beginning. Zdarksy and collaborators like the amazing Marco Checchetto are finding new lanes for the Daredevil mythos, playing in the same ballpark as Miller, Nocenti, and Bendis while finding something new to say. This is a classic in the making and a book Marvel fans should not be sleeping on.Immortal Hulk achieves the rarefied status of a consensus MVP in the Marvel lineup, and somehow feels like new issues are *always* being released. It’s prolific efficiency at its finest, in the way that only the best superhero runs ever nail. Al Ewing and Joe Bennett’s imaginative distillation of the “horror Hulk” is an instant classic in the history of Marvel, the best the Hulk’s been in over a decade, and oh so nearly my favorite Marvel comic book of 2019.It’s important to me to sell two things here: 1) House of X and Powers of X is the most exciting Marvel moment of the year and 2) Immortal Hulk is *still* insanely close to matching the book’s excellence!The House of X experience is arguably my favorite comic of 2019 from any publisher, and also the one that got me Youtubin’ weekly like a common media mogul. Nothing in comics matches the thrill of 12 straight weeks of mind-blowing X-Men comics spread across two titles. Take a bow Jonathan Hickman, Pepe Larraz, RB Silva, Marte Gracia, Tom Muller and team!Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: 2019, best marvel comicsIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

Copyright © 2022 · Metro Pro on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log inwww.cbr.com10 Comic Genres Matched With Members Of The AvengersThe Avengers are a diverse and varied blend of personalities. Each of them would be perfectly suited to a different comic book genre.The comic industry operates on a number of different genres in order to keep the stories feeling varied. Often characters can be defined by certain genres, with their books normally reflecting the sort of tone and atmosphere associated with the comic category.RELATED: 10 Young Avengers Ranked By How Good They Would Be As Leader Of The AvengersThe Avengers, Earth's mightiest heroes, reflect a whole range of comic genres therefore. Not only are they one of the greatest assembly of superheros, but they also bring together completely different categories for writers to explore. Here is some of the most prominent Avengers matched up to the genres that they are associated with.The web-slinger is known for a very specific thing. While his scientific mind and his heroic heart are both admirable, it's his sense of humor that has brought in the most fans.Spider-Man is quick witted and usually sarcastic. His comics are often associated with science fiction and fantasy, with some adventure elements. The common theme in every single one though is comedy. Spider-Man is one of the funniest Marvel characters.The war genre isn't as common within comics as it is within the movies. While the cinema will often showcase famous historical battles, comics don't tend to revisit past conflicts too often.Due to his origin, the nature of the enemies he fights and even his costume design, Captain America fits into the war genre perfectly. The inspirational leader is used to leading troops into battle, based on his ideological principles.She-Hulk has become famous for many things over the years. She may have broken the fourth wall and have been one of the strongest female Avengers to ever grace the ranks of the team.RELATED: 5 Reasons Why The Avengers' Trinity Could Beat The Justice League's (& 5 Why They Can't)But first and foremost she is a talented lawyer. The courtroom is often where she wages war, turning many of her comics into legal dramas, something that could be carried over to the future Disney+ show.Mythology, magical, monsters and different dimensions, everything about the Thor franchise links back to fantasy in some way. This has extended to other characters with the likes of Hercules and Doctor Strange following suit.The genre is a huge part of the Marvel Universe and Thor and his supporting cast really reflect that. With Jane Foster now taking on the title, the future of the fantasy genre is in capable hands.While teams like the Guardians of the Galaxy are usually responsible for what is beyond the Avengers' protection, Captain Marvel is the Avenger who defies this idea.Everywhere is under the protection of Carol Danvers, who completely embodies science fiction. The genre is more than just aliens and spaceships, it usually reflects a number of cultural and societal issues often faced closer to home.The noir genre is dark and gritty, bringing in crime and detective elements alongside deep emotional issues. Jessica Jones is a great demonstration of this category.RELATED: Marvel: 10 Moments That Changed The Comic Universe's History ForeverHer Alias arc really took on this tone and she is one of the best detectives in the Marvel Universe. Her own grit and determination takes the genre into new territory.The martial arts genre is one that is difficult to convey in comic form. There's a few characters that manage to embody the spirit and the essence of the category, asides from just the physical aspects.Iron Fist and Colleen Wing come to mind, but none more so than Shang-Chi who is often described as the master of the martial arts. The strength of his bravery is shown by the way he steps into battle every time, with nothing more than his fists.Adventure is about new discoveries, creative problem solving and dynamic action. There's a certain tone that's usually difficult to his but both Ant-Man and the Wasp convey the right atmosphere.While it is cheating to include both heroes, it's difficult to talk about one without the other. The genre really works when they are together and can use their powers in unique ways in order to continue on their adventure.Ghost Rider has served on a couple of variations of the Avengers but isn't often known for working with others. Despite this, he is a valuable teammate and one of the few Marvel characters that brings horror elements with him.His link to hell and dark magic allows him to stand out and become useful when facing equally terrifying threats. The design of the character alone is perfect for the stories told with him.Espionage and spies are a huge part of many action comics now. It's almost becoming a lost genre but Black Widow manages to keep the tone of this category alive.Espionage comics and even films play on the thriller vibe of a few other genres, while also linking the intelligent thought processes sometimes associated with the crime genre.NEXT: 10 Comic Genres Matched With Members Of The Justice LeaguePolitics graduate, freelance writer and all around film geek.

Marvel has done little to assuage these fears, with PR disaster after PR disaster, and an uncanny mutant ability to stick a foot directly in a mouth.In truth, it’s been a startling fall from grace for Marvel since the conclusion of 2015’s Secret Wars – actually since October 2016, when Marvel bewilderingly decided to release the start of All-New All-Different Marvel 3 MONTHS before Secret War had even ended. After spending the vast majority of the 2010’s in control of the Big 2 power rankings, and watching DC Comics bumble through (an increasingly underrated) New 52, Marvel found themselves directionless and without a map in 2016.As I wrote in last year’s year-end “best of,” there were plenty of good Marvel Comics throughout 2016 if you knew where to look. Time after time, though, these books were not the tried and true staples of Marvel past, with an absence of Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Avengers, or X-Men anywhere on my 2016 best-of list.2017 continues this trend, with Marvel still fumbling around in the dark before their Legacy initiative attempts to right the ship. Nonetheless, there ARE good Marvel Comics out there, sometimes on the fringes, and sometimes right up in the center of the Marvel Universe.These are my favorite Marvel Comics of 2017 (so far).Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

Issue #1 sets a great tone, though, with series writer Al Ewing launching the Inhumans into space (always a good start – just ask Transformers: More Than Meets The Eye) and revealing Black Bolt isn’t who we think he is (unless you already think he’s who we aren’t supposed to think he is, in which case, you thought right).Honestly, this is the most invested I’ve been in post Secret Wars Inhumans, despite Marvel’s many efforts to place the longtime Fantastic Four cameos front and center in the universe. Ewing has a great track record with his Marvel work on the Ultimates, and the recent appearance of Ronan the Accuser in Royals #4 suggests this could be the next great Ewing cosmic comic.Issues out: 5Collected: The Unworthy ThorCreative team: Jason Aaron, Oliver CoipelI did not expect Unworthy Thor to stand out as much as it did, but the miniseries addressing the Odinson’s fall from Mjolnir’s graces really delivered. This is especially true if you’ve been keeping up with Jason Aaron’s run on Thor since God of Thunder in 2012. Unworthy Thor finally explains what happened in 2014’s Original Sin, and how it lead to the Odinson’s standing as unworthy. While years long secrets are an exceedingly overexploited trick in comics, Aaron actually pulls off the reveal with a clear connection to the themes of his now 5 year run on the lords of Asgard.Coipel’s art is great throughout, with surprising cosmic elements and appearances from Beta Ray Bill, the Collector, and several others I won’t spoil.Issues out: 5Collected: Secret EmpireCreative team: Nick Spencer, Andrea Sorrentino,Well. Hello there. Any chance you have an opinion on Secret Empire? I thought as much.I don’t believe I’ve ever seen a superhero comic book event create as much of a firestorm as Secret Empire, beginning all the way back in April 2016 with Captain America: Steve Rogers #1. If the reveal that Captain America is an agent of Hydra, and Marvel’s disturbingly confrontational approach to criticism, is several steps too far for you to even consider reading, I respect that. Secret Empire has offended a lot of Captain America fans and comic book readers, and that’s a reality requiring reconciliation.Looking at this as another in a long line of comic book events, Secret Empire is genuinely quite good, and miles better than Civil War 2 (sure, that’s a bar set in the dirt, but it’s a bar nonetheless). I loved Spencer’s work on Morning Glories and Superior Foes of Spider-Man, liked his work on Ant-Man, and have been consistently disappointed by his runs on both Sam Cap and Cap Steve. Secret Empire is a step up from the Cap runs, and makes effective use of the Marvel Universe and present day political fears permeating America. You’ll never convince me Secret Empire wouldn’t have been more effective as the Marvel alternate-reality version of DC’s Injustice, but as it stands it’s an event that I consistently want to know more about.Issues out: 21Collected: Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol. 6Creative team: Ryan North, Erica HendersonUnbeatable Squirrel Girl is absolutely delightful, and remains the pinnacle of Marvel’s whimsical fare like Gwenpool or the Unstoppable Wasp. At this point, if you’ve given Unbeatable Squirrel Girl a chance and found it’s not serious enough for you, nothing here will change your mind. BUT, if you’ve been holding off on Squirrel Girl because… Squirrel Girl? For real? Yes, Doreen Green’s for real, and no series in Marvel kicks as many butts or eats as many nuts.Issues out: 15Collected: Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet Vol. 3Creative team: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian StelfreezeThe one consistent complaint I’ve seen against Black Panther is that the book is straight up boring. Frequently this criticism comes from long time superhero readers who have a certain expectation for Marvel comics.Personally, I’m willing to play the long game with Black Panther and Ta-Nehisi Coates, and see what Coates can do with the full benefit of an extended run. Black Panther wears its Jonathan Hickman influences on its sleeve – going so far as to spiral out of Hickman’s established character continuity – and the book reminds me most of works like New Avengers or East of West. Character’s spout impossibly well articulated philosophies in the midst of heated debate, and it’s highbrow, intellectual candy all the way through.Issues out: 2Collected: Black BoltCreative team: Saladin Ahmed, Christian WardDespite his power levels and prominence as Marvel’s Midnight King, Black Bolt’s inability to, you know, *speak* has prevented him from his own solo series until now. The vow of silence creates unique creative challenges, the sort you’ll see brilliantly handled in Jeff Loveness’ 2015 Groot solo series or in the “deaf” Hawkeye issues by Matt Fraction and David Aja.So far, the Black Bolt creative team hs circumvented these challenges exquisitely, with a visually addictive narrative about Blackagar Boltagon trapped in the prison designated for his brother, Maximums the Mad. It’s early in the run, and we’ll see how much power Black Bolt truly has in store, but to date, there’s a lyrical quality to Black Bolt not found in many other Marvel Comics and it’s well worth the price of admission.Issues out: 8Collected: Ultimates 2 Vol. 1: TroubleshootersCreative team: Al Ewing, Travel ForemanAl Ewing and Kenneth Rocafort’s Ultimates was my single favorite Marvel comic of 2016, and has proven its worth as the best Marvel cosmic comic in the post Secret Wars era. After a Civil War 2 tie-in, and a series relaunch, Ultimates has lost some steam, but Al Ewing and new series artist Travel Foreman still have some great ideas up their sleeve.This was most clear during the series latest release, when Galactus took on Ego the Living Planet in a completely new and fascinating manner. As any long time Thor reader knows, Galactus vs. Ego battles are nothing new, but Ewing puts a completely different spin on the seemingly predictable outcome (Galactus attaching a giant rocket to Ego with the aid of Thor and launching him into space).I’m optimistic that given room to grow (it won’t get it, but hey, dreams) Ultimates could have gone down alongside the Abnett and Lanning era of Nova and Guardians of the Galaxy.Issues out: 14Collected: Moon Knight Vol. 3: Birth and DeathCreative team: Jeff Lemire, Greg SmallwoodMoon Knight has been riding a comic series high since Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey redefined Mr. Knight. Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood have taken the comic series to even more experimental heights with an untraceable blend of fact and fiction. Moon Knight’s multiple personalities have always made him an unreliable narrator, but placed in the confines of a mental institute, it’s even murkier how much of Moon Knight’s “truth” is a real part of his hero’s journey.Most important of all, Lemire and Smallwood are making one of the least conventional superhero comics out there, proving that a medium defined more by consistency than experimentation still has plenty of tricks up its sleeve.Issues out: 9Collected: Infamous Iron Man Vol. 2: The Absolution of DoomCreative team: Brian Michael Bendis, Alex MaleevYou won’t find many comic book sites celebrating the work of Bendis and Maleev harder than Comic Book Herald. Their early 2000’s Daredevil was one of my first favorite Marvel Unlimited loves, and I even enjoyed the heck out of their Spider-Woman and split personality Moon Knight vs. Ultron head twelve issues.Infamous Iron Man is a… tougher conceptual sell. With Tony Stark sidelined by his Civil War 2 coma, Victor Von Doom, the most notorious and greatest villain in comics, has taken up the mantle of the Infamous Iron Man (although I’m fairly certain he leaves the ‘infamous’ part out on his business cards).Issues out: 8Collected: Thanos Vol. 1: Thanos ReturnsCreative team: Jeff Lemire, Mike DeodatoWhen it comes to Thanos, I’m a bit protective. In general, I’ve maintained that very few creators should even attempt to touch the Mad Titan, aside from our cosmic overmind Jim Starlin. Over the past 20 years, the only creator who managed to tell a Thanos story that passed this test was Jonathan Hickman, aka the writer responsible for the best author-verse in Marvel since Chris Claremont.Jeff Lemire and Mike Deodato have astonishingly already proved up to the challenge with their launch of a solo Thanos series. Simply put, Thanos is excellent, likely even better than Starlin’s own take on a Thanos solo series in 2003 to 2004. If you like Marvel cosmic, or series starring “villains,” Thanos is a can’t miss.Note for new readers, that Thanos is very much reliant on your familiarity with the past 5 or so years of continuity, including Hickman’s generals of Thanos as well as Thane, son of Thanos. The series also occurs in the wake of Secret Wars, with a notably weakened Thanos attempting to take back his rightful position as a galactic nightmare.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured If you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "So Captain America and Iron Man walk into a bar: Who gets served first?Let’s just see.With the success of Black Panther so far this year and the release of Avengers: Infinity War coming Friday, April 27, we wondered: Which Marvel movie characters are the most popular? We couldn’t resist a deep data dive. See below for our findings.But first, how is popularity determined?  Among 30 characters who received first, second, or third billing in the Marvel movies released so far, it’s no small feat for Ant-Man to start our list off at #10. Paul Rudd’s role was worth an estimated $4.8M in his 2015 eponymous film’s opening weekend.Actress Gwenyth Paltrow received second billing in both Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3, making her portrayal worth an estimated average of $5.2M. Now that’s gotta cover all the damage Tony has wreaked upon their home.Black Panther’s opening weekend was so big that even its second-billed role — that of villain Erik Killmonger played by Michael B. Jordan — was worth $6.9M. Don’t go spending that all on one big piece of vibranium, OK, Erik?Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange is valued at an estimated $7.2M to place him at No. 7. Hopefully, he has zippers on those pockets so that when he turns the world sideways, all that money doesn’t fall out.The only “alien” on our list is none other than Asgard’s own Thor, played by Chris Hemsworth. At this point in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor has starred in three of his own movies, and also received second billing in Avengers: Age of Ultron, worth an estimated average of $7.4M.While an estimated $8.9M won’t turn back time for Chris Evans’ Captain America, it does place him halfway down our list. He’s also starred in three of his own movies, but apparently, resonates a bit more with moviegoers than the hammer-wielding god just above.Now what can a high schooler like Peter Parker — played by Tom Holland — do with an estimated $9.8M? Certainly that should mean he no longer has to sell photos of his superhero self to the newspaper, right? Oh man, oh man. Just think of how many vintage mixtapes $10.1M can get Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord. That’s how much opening-weekend money we estimated two starring roles in Guardians of the Galaxy movies have earned him.Now we’re getting to the big leagues. Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man is the original Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero, and has received top billing in seven out of the 18 movies released so far. That’s earned him an averaged value of $10.7M.So you can believe the hype. The opening weekend of Black Panther brought in $201.8M, which puts its titular role, played by Chadwick Boseman, in first place here, worth an estimated $17M all by himself. Wakanda superhero can match that? None.\n",

The company continued to tell the tales of the mutants changing lives in Krakoa while also delivering big stories with the introduction of a new Phoenix on Earth and the return of a classic Thor character that turned his life upside down.RELATED: 10 Unpopular Opinions About X-Men Comics, According To RedditEven with all those stories, they didn't rank among the best of the year for Marvel Comics. Marvel's best comics of 2021 featured long-form storytelling, a mishmash of genres, science fiction adventures, political intrigue, and one of the most horrific superhero stories Marvel has told in years.If there was one comic book that had a little bit of everything in 2021, it was Captain Marvel. Kelly Thompson threw everything but the kitchen sink at Carol Danvers, and it all seemed to stick. This all really started with Carol being thrown into a post-apocalyptic future with Namor's son in control.That led to Carol returning to her time and trying to gain magical powers, despite Doctor Strange trying to stop her. It all came to a head with Captain Marvel in an all-out battle with Vox Supreme, and through it all, Captain Marvel was one of the most consistently entertaining Marvel Comics of 2021.Iron Man took a dark turn in 2021. In his new solo title by Christopher Cantwell and Cafu, things got off to an intriguing start as the general public was turning on Iron Man. He tried to respond by becoming more relatable, but that made even more people hate him. He then got dumped by Wasp and ended up almost killing himself multiple times in battles with villains.It took another broken soul in Hellcat to show him what he was doing to himself. That new romance was a great addition to the comics, but then things really exploded when Iron Man had to battle a returning Korvac and took a team of misfits with him into outer space to stop the would-be-god. Between Tony's self-destructive behavior and the fun new team, Iron Man was one of the best reads of 2021.With Moon Knight coming to Disney+, Marvel began working him back into a more prominent role in the comics. It all started with Moon Knight battling the Avengers with Mephisto and Khonshu at war. However, when that ended, Jed McKay and Alessandro Cappuccio started the Moon Knight solo comic and it was brilliant.RELATED: The Coolest Storylines Marvel's Moon Knight Could Adapt from The ComicsMoon Knight now worked as a protector on the streets, almost like a priest who ensured that everyone, even vampires, could live in peace without people trying to kill them. Add in his required therapy sessions and a new disciple of Khonshu wanting to take over, and this was a book that was as bizarre and captivating as Moon Knight fans could ever want.Guardians of the Galaxy has been changing a lot over the last couple of years. The creative duo of Al Ewing and Juann Cabal has taken the superhero team, which looks completely dissimilar to what fans are used to, and told some of the best stories in Marvel Comics in 2021.Star-Lord is very different since he died and returned with the actual powers of a star, now one of the Guardians of the Galaxy's most powerful members. Hercules was a fantastic addition and the diversity he and Moondragon bring to the book helps it stand out. While the Doctor Doom story was a little off, that was just a blip in an otherwise fantastic 2021 for the Marvel Cosmic team.There were a lot of big stories in the world of mutants in 2021. From The Trial of Magneto to the Hellfire Gala to the great stories in The New Mutants and The X-Men returning to the United States, there was a lot going on in Krakoa. However, the best comic from the world of mutants was Hellions.This book took some of the most bizarre mutants in Krakoa and put them together on a team that made X-Force look tame in comparison. With Psylocke and Havok leading the way, under the command of Mister Sinister, this book ended up being the Marvel equivalent to the Suicide Squad, and was in turns hilarious and exciting, bringing the best out of the mutant's books.Chip Zdarsky and Marco Checceto created one of the best Daredevil stories told in years. In this series, Daredevil accidentally killed a man and refused to let it go. Instead, he agreed to serve time in prison for the murder, only to find everyone there wanted him dead.Matt Murdock's guilt is old news by now, but this series brought something fresh, with its side stories. Elektra took on the role of Daredevil to protect Hell's Kitchen, Bullseye was resurrected, and Kingpin and Typhoid Mary had a shocking relationship build throughout the story. This was Daredevil the way he was meant to be written.Nick Spencer finished his run on Amazing Spider-Man with a massive sprawling story that tied everything he had built together for an explosive climax. Kindred showed up a few years back and tormented Spider-Man and Norman Osborn.By the end of 2021, Kindred's identity was revealed and Spider-Man battled almost all his greatest villains. However, 2021 saw Spencer take the notorious One More Day and fix the problems it caused in a fantastic manner. By the end, he had changed the heroes and some of the villains in ways that should pay off in the years to come.Marvel has tried to have Black Cat comics in the past, but when Jed MacKay and CF Villa took over with her 2021 series, something finally clicked. Black Cat ended up in several big crossover events and proved to be more than capable of holding her own.RELATED: Spider-Man: No Way Home's Main Characters, Ranked By IntelligenceThe Black Cat series helped tie into some of the events, including her role with Spider-Man in his battle with Kindred and Felicia playing a very important role in the King in Black storyline. When the comic scaled back and let her deal with her battle with the Thieves Guild, things really heated up.Al Ewing wrapped up his run on Immortal Hulk, which ended up as the best Hulk series in a very long time. With the series ending in 2021, all the mysteries that Ewing introduced, from the One Below to the Green Door were finally revealed and Hulk and his allies were able to finally move on.This was the most horrific series that Marvel produced when it came to the main comic lines, with Hulk dying more than once. He morphed and changed, with the entire world seeming against him while he just tried to survive. Next to Peter David's Hulk run, Immortal Hulk is the best of the best.Ta-Nehisi Coates turned in one of the most groundbreaking runs on Black Panther in the character's history. After that, he started his run on Captain America and presented a story that was as topical as it was exciting. Coates dared to take the Red Skull and make him an internet sensation with Americans wanting to follow him over the more stoic Captain America.With the idea of Americans following a fascist villain, and believing he is the better option, this might be a hard read for some fans. However, the story was well written, both sides were given depth, and this saw Captain America and his allies have to question how they could deal with a country that was turning on itself.NEXT: The 10 Best Sam Wilson Stories In The Comic BooksShawn S.

The vast majority of these picks have been running long enough that you can read at least the first volume or story arc in full on Marvel Unlimited (there are notable exceptions).For the most part, you’ll notice that the best of 2016 largely steers clear of traditional big name books like Avengers, Spider-Man, or X-Men. Likewise, Marvel’s Civil War 2 has featured some compelling ideas, but has been tedious to actually follow in full, never actualizing like some of Marvel’s best events.But we aren’t here to talk about what went wrong – it’s time for the best Marvel comics of the year!Creators: Greg Pak, Frank ChoFirst Issue Published: December 2, 2015Comic Book Herald is reader-supported.

It’s an appropriate last chance to celebrate the definitive Frank Castle artist of the 2000’s then, and Becky Cloonan’s story matches the energy you’d expect for the Punisher.Creators: G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, Takeshi MiyazawaFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: You will 100% enjoy this more if you’ve read Ms. Marvel’s debut during Marvel Now! (see also: the first four volumes).Collected: Ms. Marvel Vol. 5: Super FamousAt this point, Ms. Marvel suffers for simply being very good as opposed to dizzyingly great. 2016 has been a very interesting year for Ms. Marvel, as she’s fully transitioned from charming outsider to full-fledged All-New Avenger. The transition has been far from seamless, and if you think Avenger status feels like too much, too soon, those are themes Ms. Marvel’s creators are wrestling with as well.I expect we still have plenty of great Ms. Marvel yet to come from this creative lineup, as G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, and Takeshi Miyazawa have even pulled surprisingly inventive storytelling techniques out of Civil War 2, drawing from real life civil war and immigration where other books have passively taken the conflict at face value.Creators: Charles Soule, Ron GarneyFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: Two approaches here – Either catch up with the Mark Waid era of Daredevil during Marvel NOW!, or completely ignore all recent history and just accept that Daredevil’s basically back to status quo we know and love from, say, Daredevil Netflix (sort of).Collected: Daredevil: Back in Black Vol. 1: ChinatownSoule and Garney get a ton of credit for raising Daredevil to above average quality after the excellent Waid era didn’t leave a lot of room to run.It’s not a game-changer, but Daredevil taking a protege (he turns invisible; of course he turns invisible) opens up some new dimensions for the hero of Hell’s Kitchen. Simply put, it’s what you want out of reading Daredevil comics.Creators: Jason Aaron, Russell DautermanFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: This story-line all begins with Thor Vol. 1: The Goddess of ThunderCollected: Mighty Thor Vol. 1: Thunder in Her VeinsNow that Jason Aaron’s Thor: God of Thunder transition has gotten out of the beleaguered and unfortunate “Who is the Red Hulk?!” phase, we’re starting to see again what made Aaron, here with art from Russell Dauterman, such a master of the Asgardian realm. Creators: Jason Aaron, Chris BachaloFirst Issue Published: October 7, 2015Continuity Connections?: References Doctor Strange’s continuity throughout the 2000’s, so either read the Comic Book Herald Marvel Reading Order, or just pick up from here and enjoy.Collected: Doctor Strange Vol. 1: The Way of the WeirdJason Aaron has a track record for some of my favorite comics (Scalped, Southern Bastards) as well as some of my favorite Marvel Comics (Wolverine & the X-Men, Thor: God of Thunder), so I may have built up unrealistic expectations for his run on Doctor Strange with the colorfully Lovecraftian art of Chris Bachalo.While Doctor Strange hasn’t blown me away like I hoped it would, I have been happy with just how weird Aaron and Bachalo let the comic get, taking the magic of the Marvel universe in recently unexplored directions. More than anything, Doctor Strange is a beautiful glimpse of where a post-origins MCU Doctor Strange can go, mystical battleaxe and Tardis-like Sanctum Sanctorum on full display at all times.Creators: Joe Kelly, Ed McGuinnessFirst Issue Published: January 6, 2016Continuity Connections?:Reasonably self-contained, but makes reference to recent events from Uncanny Avengers #1. Additionally, you’ll want to be familiar with current issues of Amazing Spider-Man and Deadpool.Collected: Spider-Man/Deadpool Vol.1: Isn’t it BromanticJoe Kelly and Ed McGuiness produced one of my favorite Deadpool runs of all time in the late 90’s, and the two haven’t lost a step with the comical Spider-Man team-up book. For my money, it’s the best Deadpool book on the stands in a 2016 crowded with Deadpool.Creators: Kate Leth, Brittney L. WilliamsFirst Issue Published: December 23, 2015Continuity Connections?: Everything you need is contained in the story.Collected: Patsy Walker, A.K.A. Hellcat! Vol. 1: Hooked On A FelineWonderfully positive, upbeat all-ages from a writer with unimpeachable credentials (I heard her name a few times on Welcome to Nightvale!). Patsy Walker definitely skews younger, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say the book is purely for kids by any measure. If anything, I weigh Patsy Walker higher simply because true all ages comics are so difficult to come by from either Big 2 comic book publisher. Creators: Jeff Lemire, Andrea SorrentinoFirst Issue Published: January 27, 2016Continuity Connections?: Previously outside Marvel Earth-616 continuity, but you’ll want to read Mark Millar and Steve McNiven’s original Old Man Logan, as well as the Secret Wars tie-in.Collected: Wolverine: Old Man Logan Vol. 1: BerzerkerIf you read the Old Man Logan Secret Wars tie-in, you already know that Andrea Sorrentino’s art is going to carry an Old Man Logan ongoing to new heights. Couple that with the perpetually inventive Jeff Lemire, and this alternate reality curiosity suddenly finds life as a suitable Wolverine replacement in the Marvel Universe.Creators: Dennis Hopeless, Javier RodriguezFirst Issue Published: November 18, 2015Continuity Connections?: May not make a lick of sense if you haven’t read Hopeless’ run on Spider-Woman leading up to this as part of Marvel Now reading order.Collected: Spider-Woman: Shifting Gears Vol. 1: Baby TalkJavier Rodriguez’s art sends Spider-Woman soaring past all expectations. This is a gorgeous book, with a concept (pregnant, single-mom heroine) I’ve not seen in a Marvel book before. Creators: Tom Taylor, David LopezFirst Issue Published: November 11, 2015Continuity Connections?: It will certainly help to have read the Death of Wolverine event.Collected: All-New Wolverine Vol.1: The Four SistersTom Taylor’s work on Injustice for DC proved that even mired in the darkest timeline, Taylor had the awareness and presence to pace HIS version of Batman v Superman with a laugh-out-loud funny Harley Quinn and Green Arrow interlude.Taylor brings the same blend of focus to All-New Wolverine, mixing the violence and adrenaline of X-23 with a surprisingly charming newfound family life. Any replacement of a beloved character can easily fall flat, but All-New Wolverine has been a success through and through.Creators: Jason Latour, Robbi RodriguezFirst Issue Published: October 14, 2015Continuity Connections?: Spider-Gwen’s origins come out of Marvel’s Spider-Verse, but otherwise if you know the core history of Spider-Man, you’re basically ready to roll.Collected: Spider-Gwen Vol.1: Greater PowerAdmittedly, Spider-Gwen stands a leg above much of its competition purely based on concept. It’s a brilliant alternate reality, and Robbi Rodriguez’s art looks unlike anything else in the Marvel Universe.It’s the little things that set Spider-Gwen apart, though, like its commitment to the punk rock of the Mary Janes, or its alternate timeline inversions of Marvel staples like Matt Murdock or Ben Grimm.Creators: Jeff Lemire, Greg SmallwoodFirst Issue Published: April 13, 2016Continuity Connections?: Frequent references to the history of Moon Knight as a character, but otherwise, you can easily pick this up and read without context in the Marvel Universe at large.Collected: Moon Knight Vol. 1: LunaticMoon Knight is instantly captivating, stylistically unique, and constantly challenging your sense of reality and what’s safe. Topping the Marvel Now Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey Moon Knight six issue opening arc was going to be no small feat, but Jeff Lemire and Greg Smallwood are attempting to do so with much larger aims. Where Ellis and Shalvey composed glorious punk rock anthems, Lemire and Smallwood strive for the long game, with a labyrinthine insane asylum that quests towards the center of the true Moon Knight – whoever that may be.Creators: Warren Ellis, Gerardo ZaffinoFirst Issue Published: October 21, 2015Continuity Connections?: Definitely helps to have read Infinity and Inhumanity to see how we got here.Collected: Karnak Vol. 1: The Flaw in All ThingsNot to typecast, but aligning comics legend Warren Ellis with the new crankiest character in the entire Marvel Universe was an absolute stroke of genius.Karnak could easily be an investigative science-spy mystery outside the Marvel Universe, except it includes SHIELD hellicarriers and the best Phil Coulson and Simmons appearances in all of Marvel Comics. Karnak has made some great appearances throughout 2016, including the Ulysses infinite comic as part of Civil War 2, but the Ellis and Zaffino (and now Roland Boschi) ongoing is well worth a read.Creators: Chelsea Cain, Kate NiemczykFirst Issue Published: March 09, 2016Continuity Connections?: Light, if any.Collected: Mockingbird Vol. 1: I Can ExplainMockingbird comes storming out of the gates with one of the most interesting first issues in Marvel Comics of 2016, quickly proclaiming that Chelsea Cain and Kate Niemczyk aren’t content with standard by-the-numbers fare for Bobbi Morse.Creators: Ta-Nehisi Coates, Brian StelfreezeFirst Issue Published: April 6, 2016Continuity Connections?: Very much follows in the wake of Avengers vs. X-Men, and Jonathan Hickman’s time on New Avengers building up to Secret Wars.Collected: Black Panther: A Nation Under Our Feet Book 1Ta-Nehisi Coates and Brian Stelfreeze’s Black Panther dives headfirst into Wakandan politics and it’s hard not to see immediate and prescient parallels to real-world government and society. This is the most heavily absorbed into Wakanda a comic has been since the wonderful Panther’s Rage by Don McGregor, and it’s off to a promising and hopefully lengthy run.Creators: Ryan North, Erica HendersonFirst Issue Published: October 28, 2015Continuity Connections?: I’d recommend starting with the first volume of Unbeatable Squirrel Girl during Marvel Now, as that will explain all the supporting characters and tone of the series.Collected: The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Vol. 3: Squirrel, You Really Got Me NowIt’s probably safe to say that if you don’t like The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, you REALLY don’t like the Unbeatable Squirrel Girl. No Marvel comic has quite mirrored pure unfiltered McSweeney’s humor like Ryan North and Erica Henderson’s Squirrel Girl. It’s fun, it’s positive, it’s upbeat, and it’s exactly that way ALL THE TIME!!!Lost in some of the silliness, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is breaking comic book storytelling conventions like they ever even mattered, from self-referential author insertion in the gutters of every page (#I’mNotScottMcCloud) to a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure issue that is likely my favorite single issue of any comic book in 2016.Creators: Tom King, Gabriel Hernandez WaltaFirst Issue Published: November 4, 2015Continuity Connections?: One of the best “just jump in read” Marvel comics since Hawkeye. Part of what makes Vision so great for comic book fans is the series is not particularly reliant on ongoing Marvel continuity. There are brief references to All-New All-Different Avengers, and definitely plenty of callbacks to the long history of Vision in the Marvel Universe. If you don’t have an encyclopedic knowledge of Vision’s history with the Avengers, and can’t necessarily list the 37 times the Vision saved the planet, you can still read Vision and enjoy it.Collected: Vision Vol. 1: Little Worse Than A ManVision isn’t my number one favorite Marvel comic of 2016, but only barely. That said, Vision is the Marvel Comic I’d be most likely to hand to a new comic book reader, or a friend who might otherwise assume a lower level of intellect from the medium. Tom King and Gabriel Hernandez Walta have crafted a stunningly cohesive treatise on trying to achieve normalcy in suburban America, even when you’re a family of Visions and were perhaps doomed from the start.Vision is not at all what you’d expect from a comic book staring everyone’s favorite Android Avenger, and Marvel is far better for it.Creators: Al Ewing, Kenneth RocafortFirst Issue Published: November 11, 2015Continuity Connections?: Ultimates is one of the rare Marvel comics that actually explains some of the Secret Wars fallout, making it pretty heavily integrated into ongoing Marvel continuity. If that wasn’t enough, Ultimates dives head first into Civil War 2 tie-ins mid-year 2016. Not a book you easily read removed from the Marvel Universe at large.Collected: Ultimates: Omniversal Vol. 1: Start With the ImpossibleMarvel’s relaunched Ultimates, expanding on the legacy of Mark Millar and Bryan Hitch’s Ultimate Universe linchpin, is simultaneously the best team book, best post Secret Wars book, and best cosmic book in the Marvel universe.The team of Blue Marvel, Captain Marvel, Black Panther, America Chavez, and Monica Rambeau take on the proactive, transparent opposite of Marvel’s Illuminati, and aim no lower in their first arc than solving Galactus. It’s glorious Marvel space science, and even through the potential tedium of Civil War 2 tie-ins, Kenneth Rocafort’s untouchable page-breaking layouts continue to bring plenty of cosmic, including Thanos unlike we’ve ever seen him.Simply put, if you liked Secret Wars, Abnett & Lanning Marvel Cosmic, and Jim “Cosmic King” Starlin comics, Ultimates will be the most refreshing Marvel comic you read in 2016. There you have it – the best 20 Marvel comics of 2016.

      "Tyler says January 19, 2017 at 8:55 pmI think the only other book I’d put on the list would be Bunn’s Uncanny. The character callbacks, developments, and tone of the book blew me away. It’s biggest downfall is Land’s art, which can pretty much ruin a book, but Bunn’s storytelling in Uncanny has proved to be some of the best X-Men content in the last few years.\n",
      "Navarre says November 29, 2016 at 12:01 pmThis list is filled with great books. But there is one glaring omission: Silver Surfer by Slott & Allred. Which should be on all the lists.\n",
      "Another book I’m enjoying but I don’t feel has to be on everyone’s list (though it is on mine) is Waid & Samnee’s Black Widow.Keep up the good work.\n",
      "Dave says December 1, 2016 at 7:31 pmI really enjoyed the first run by Slott and Allred, definitely need to pay more attention to the 2016 version. Any Marvel Comic from Mike Allred is pretty much a guaranteed win.Behind on Black Widow, too, I’ll have to give that one a look as well!\n",

But its earlier publishing years offered a diverse selection of genres to a hungry audience alongside its costumed crimebusters and at times even supplanting them. Marvel’s genre titles maintained their relevance throughout the decades before getting another big shot in the 1970s. Publisher Martin Goodman launched his comic book empire with a bang in 1939, relying on then-editor Joe Simon to hit the ground running with new troops of Super Heroes to not only capitalize on the growing trend, but to pave the way for innovations, too. Legendary artist Jack Kirby joined the Timely Comics team the next year to kick off a new decade that would be overshadowed by war, but also offer hope in the form of such dynamic and patriotic characters as Captain America.In 1942, Timely Super Heroes marched in step with another comic crowd, a growing army of funny animal humor characters. Titles like COMEDY COMICS and KRAZY KOMICS offered the antics of Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal, as well as Powerhouse Pepper and Super Rabbit. Goodman saw his profits rise throughout the dark days of World War II by watching publishing trends, and when mystery men and women began to decline in popularity by the end of the war in 1945, he added more comedic critters to the mix and bolstered their ranks with a new craze: teen humor titles.Patsy Walker, Millie the Model, Nellie the Nurse, and their ilk made their voices known as a sort-of balm to a world weary from war and ready for light-hearted adventures with beautiful boys and girls. By 1947, the teen books exploded in what can only be called a boom as Super Heroes continued to slide into decline. At this point, crime and Western comics also found a welcome niche at Timely, and series like OFFICIAL TRUE CRIME CASES COMICS and KID COLT OUTLAW took over the spotlight, joined by a new genre aimed at a somewhat older, more mature audience.Joe Simon and Jack Kirby created romance comics for another company in an attempt to capture the “true love” magazine crowd, and Martin Goodman, always on the look-out for another avenue of exploration, published his first foray into the genre with MY ROMANCE. It proved to be such a hit with readers that more such love letters followed, cementing the idea within the industry.By the end of the decade, several things occurred at Goodman’s house. As funny animals fell out of favor, he converted his remaining Super Hero books into other themes such as horror, dropped the Timely Comics brand name, and mashed his two popular genres of romance and Westerns up into hybrid titles like COWBOY ROMANCES and RANGELAND LOVE. The for-the-most-part nameless comic book company forged ahead into the 1950s, eager to expand and electrify, little knowing a storm cloud lingered on the horizon in the name of decency and family values.With the war’s paper rationing behind him, Martin Goodman steered his ship into a second decade with full steam ahead and an eye on both increased publishing and profits. The Korean War brought war comics to the front lines in 1951, and under the new moniker of Atlas Comics, Goodman brought out BATTLE, WAR COMICS, SPY FIGHTERS, and his first character-driven war title, COMBAT KELLY. In addition, he poured more resources into the creeping horror genre with such title as MYSTIC, ASTONISHING, and STRANGE TALES, and even transformed an existing Super Hero book, VENUS, into a terror tome. In 1952, Atlas offered an incredible array of series, covering war, horror, crime, Westerns, romance, sports, teen humor, science fiction, and even a nod or two to the then-passé funny animal world. By the next year, Goodman added LORNA THE JUNGLE QUEEN, SPEED CARTER SPACEMAN, and PATSY AND HER PALS into his stable, as well as experimenting with oddball one-offs like BIBLE TALES FOR YOUNG FOLK. The man never knew a genre he wouldn’t exploit.But such popularity also attracted detractors. A crusading psychiatrist named Frederic Wertham seized upon, among other things, the no-rules horror comics of the day and made a public issue out of them, going so far as to encouraging parents to turn upon the comics industry and see it as he saw it – a “seduction of the innocent” that just couldn’t continue. In 1954, after a Senate subcommittee hearing on the topic, Goodman joined with other leaders in the business to create the Comics Code Authority, a self-policing entity that took the teeth out of not only horror books, but just about every other title on the stands.The industry as it stood in 1955 looked different than its earlier existence. Comics still proliferated and in many genres, but as nicer, gentler reading material. Atlas Comics looked for other ways to earn its money, introducing books like BLACK KNIGHT, WYATT EARP, YELLOW CLAW, and SNAFU, but despite the diversity, artists and writers began to abandon the industry for safer, calmer waters. By the end of 1957, Goodman lost much of his distribution and slashed titles left and right. As the end of the decade approached, only 16 books remained of the dozens he once published, a pale shadow of a once mighty machine.The publisher left much of the day-to-day business to editor Stan Lee, who trudged ahead and watched for opportunities to use the talent he had on-hand, namely Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko. New trends would arise, informing a bright new universe just over the next hill.Monsters—that’s what Stan Lee produced, and at the newly christened Marvel Comics, that’s what sold as the 1950s transitioned into the 1960s. Books like TALES OF SUSPENSE and TALES TO ASTONISH illustrated multiple invasions of Earth by armies of towering atrocities. In 1960, while other genres still sold, Lee and company pressed hard on the monstrosities allowed by the Code and created a sub-genre all its own.Then, something else happened. The Super Heroes came back to the company in 1961, and with a vengeance. Lee took the idea of the popular monsters he’d been writing about for the last few years and molded them into heroes, and in doing so breathed new blood and life into a theme that had both seen better days and had never, really gone away. The downside of blockbusters like 1961’s FANTASTIC FOUR and 1962’s AMAZING SPIDER-MAN lurked in the fact that as the costumed crimefighters ascended once again, the other genres not only took a backseat, but more accurately crawled into the trunk. As the decade exploded with four-color fantasies, older titles were converted into Super Hero series and themes of horror, science fiction, and the like became submerged in the new trend. Where once they enjoyed their own titles, they now shored up the heroes with jumping-off points and launch pads.By the end of the 1960s and the dawn of the 1970s, Marvel attempted to hang onto its diversity with new publications like MAD ABOUT MILLIE, CHILI, TOWER OF SHADOWS, and MY LOVE, but the writing on the wall spoke of Super Heroes. As time marched along, what was once Timely and Atlas’s bread and butter became Marvel Comics’ dim past, not its shining future.Perhaps flush with its success with Super Heroes in the 1960s, the company tried to look for opportunities to branch out over the 1970s. Black and white magazine-sized books seemed to be just the ticket, and unhampered by the Comics Code and aiming at older audiences, Marvel published SAVAGE TALES #1 in 1971, which introduced the macabre Man-Thing and other dark fancies. A significant alteration to the Code in 1972 allowed for horror creatures again, and Marvel opened up the vaults to unleash such terror titans as Werewolf by Night, Dracula, Ghost Rider, the Frankenstein Monster, and even the Son of Satan himself.Fads of the 1970s translated into new series for the company, like spotlighting martial arts in books such as DEADLY HANDS OF KUNG FU and with characters called Shang-Chi and Iron Fist. Science fiction made a comeback in the form of Killraven, who fought the War of the Worlds in AMAZING ADVENTURES in 1973, and the cyborg Deathlok in ASTONISHING TALES in 1974. Even offbeat ideas like COMIX BOOK, an “underground”-style magazine, and funny animals with a twist, like HOWARD THE DUCK, gained a small foothold in the experimental ‘70s.It seemed like a brave new world, but by the decade’s midpoint, the Super Heroes asserted themselves again, and all the other genres were quietly folded into the costumed characters’ universe. Media tie-ins like STAR WARS, TARZAN, and JOHN CARTER WARLORD OF MARS in 1977 were the last hurrah of diversity, and by 1980, Marvel was poised to take the crown for most-popular Super Hero publisher.Super Heroes still dominate to this day, though inquiring minds will always find the echoes of comics history by simply looking back and marveling at the long and winding road of the House of Ideas’ path.

      "The ten best Marvel Comics stories from the House of IdeasNewsarama's list of the best Marvel Comics stories will have a new addition if the publisher has anything to say about it.Marvel has been setting up Judgment Day as its next big event story, which will apparently put the X-Men and Eternals in a standoff with the Avengers caught in the middle - which sounds like the recipe for a knockdown-dragout battle for the ages.And Marvel has plenty of experience with telling epic tales that stand the test of time - with stories like Civil War and Infinity Gauntlet working their way into the public consciousness as classic stories above and beyond the comic book medium.But what are the best Marvel Comics stories ever? Though that may seem like a daunting question, Newsarama has prepared a list of the best Marvel Comics stories of all time!The original X-Men story 'Days of Future Past ' was simply two issues of the main ongoing series, Uncanny X-Men #141 and #142 (Take that, 200+ issue events of today!) In a dystopian future, mutants have been rounded up into concentration camps; that is, the ones who haven't been slaughtered. Adult Kitty Pryde's consciousness travels back in time to stop the assassination of a prominent government figure (in the story, Senator Robert Kelly) by Mystique and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.While she succeeds, and the world is avoided (at least in one timeline), there are some lasting effects. Rachel Summers, a prominent character in today's X-Men titles, came from that alternate future. So did the hyper-advanced Nimrod Sentinel, which has been a key antagonist in the current X-Men era.The storyline was adapted into the 2014 feature film, one of the most highly-regarded of the Fox X-Men franchise. Buy: AmazonIn 2006, Marvel Comics decided they were going to ignite the cosmic corner of the Marvel Universe. Writer Keith Giffen was tapped to conceive a limited series and a set of tie-ins titled Annihilation, intended to establish characters new and old as major players in the Marvel universe. The story, told entirely apart from the mainstream Marvel Universe without the input of heroes like the Avengers and X-Men, letting the more obscure cosmic heroes take the spotlight - eventually leading to the formation of a new version of the Guardians of the Galaxy, who became the basis for the popular MCU version of the team.Indeed, the Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise literally would not have come to pass without Annihilation having redefined Star-Lord, Groot, and Rocket, and bringing that group of heroes together in the first place.Buy: AmazonLong before anyone could even conceive of carving out a whole corner of the Marvel Universe devoted to cosmic threats, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created what may still be considered the ultimate cosmic threat: Galactus.First appearing in Fantastic Four #48-50, the godlike being from beyond the stars came careening into the solar system and the lives of Marvel's First Family, widening the entire scope of the Marvel Universe in the process.Both the Silver Surfer and The Watcher also made their debuts in 'The Coming of Galactus,' with the latter becoming a burgeoning figure in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the recent What If...? animated Disney Plus series.Buy: AmazonThere was a time when Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli could basically do no wrong, and 1986-1987 was simply a magical period for the pair, who essentially reinvented major street-level vigilante heroes for both Marvel and DC in the span of about a year and a half - including, most importantly for this list, Marvel's Daredevil.The pair's arc together on Daredevil #227-231 (with some ancillary work in #232 and #233) has it all: romance, intrigue, religion, and of course tons of action. There’s The Kingpin, Ben Urich, Nuke, and Captain America. This story basically tears Daredevil down to virtually nothing and lets him emerge, 'Born Again,' into a better, stronger hero than ever before.Marvel is even invoking 'Born Again' as a reference point for its upcoming Punisher relaunch, which promises big changes for Frank Castle.Buy: AmazonNo, not 2015-16's Secret Wars - but the original!Back in 1984, Marvel Comics and toy makers Mattel had the big idea to team up for a joint toyline and accompanying comic book series featuring all the biggest heroes and villains of the Marvel Universe in one story, resulting in Secret Wars, the first major Marvel crossover event.Secret Wars set the mold for later Marvel events with its own 12-issue limited series, as well as tie-in stories told through ten other comics. Secret Wars pitted a veritable who's-who of Marvel heroes and villains against each other, with the results being an occasionally goofy but still exciting and even defining story with ramifications that spiraled out across the entire Marvel Universe.Spider-Man's black Symbiote suit (that was really Venom), She-Hulk on the Fantastic Four, the second Spider-Woman Julia Carpenter - they all got their start in Secret Wars, along with even more storylines and character changes that continued to play out in a much less well-received sequel just a few years later.Buy: AmazonIn the late '90s, Marvel proclaimed they were going to cancel the entire X-Men line, then at the height of its immense popularity, and replace it with a whole new slate of titles - and lo they did, reimagining the entire X-line in an alternate reality with a vastly different status quo.The result was four months of alternate-reality comic books titled 'Age of Apocalypse,' which turned the entire X-Men franchise on its head with new roles and new relationships for almost all the line's characters. Set in a timeline where Charles Xavier died before founding the X-Men and Apocalypse is the unquestioned ruler of the world, 'Age of Apocalypse' presented readers with wildly different takes on Nightcrawler, Cyclops, Wolverine, Magneto, Rogue, and many, many more.Though an event as massive as 'Age of Apocalypse' is never without its hiccups, the story took fans by storm - with some of the new versions of the characters even making it into the mainstream Marvel Universe after the story concluded and the classic X-Men timeline was restored.Buy: AmazonThis story beat 'Age of Apocalypse' by one vote in our reader poll. One of the newest stories on our list, Marvel's Civil War asked the question, 'Whose side are you on?'Civil War starts with a bang (so sorry) as the New Warriors, while trying to subdue a B-list villain, are involved in a resulting explosion that kills 600 people (including many children and the New Warriors themselves) at a Stamford, Connecticut elementary school. As a result, the US government fast-tracks legislation called the Superhuman Registration Act, requiring anyone with powers and abilities beyond that of a mortal person to register with the government - thereby revealing their identity, with the caveat that they must train with government-approved heroes if they want to keep using their powers.(The concept of the SHRA was somewhat adapted into the MCU as the Sokovia Accords).Ultimately, this leads to Iron Man leading the pro-registration side and Captain America leading the anti-registration folks, with the two sides going all-out in a superhero civil war - a war with real consequences with major deaths.Tony Stark becomes Director of SHIELD, while Captain America is assassinated, leading to a much deeper, longer-term rift between many of Marvel's heroes.Marvel loved this story so much it was adapted to film in the blockbuster Captain America: Civil War and led to a comic book sequel, Civil War II. Buy: AmazonOutside of the death of Uncle Ben, it's quite possible that Amazing Spider-Man #121-122 are the most important issues in the entire life of Peter Parker. The story said it right there in the title. They spoiled the outcome. They told the truth. This would be 'The Night Gwen Stacy Died.'Norman Osborn, back as the Green Goblin, takes Gwen Stacy - Pete's girlfriend at the time - and throws her off a bridge. Just when it looks like Spider-Man successfully saves her, his webbing catches her ankle ... but the sudden stop snaps her neck.Gwen's death was utterly tragic, and a true surprise - devastating Peter Parker (and many readers) like almost nothing before or since. It's heartbreaking and shocking, and in 1973, it was something that made people look at comic books, especially superhero comic books, in a very different way.Buy: Amazon'The Dark Phoenix Saga ,' to this day, is the story that all other X-Men stories are held up to. The first seeds of the tale began way back in 1976 when Jean Grey first came into contact with the Phoenix Force in X-Men #101-108. Then the 'Dark' part hit four years later in #129-138, as Jean comes under the influence of the Hellfire Club.A masterpiece of a story by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, this epic holds some truly marquee moments for the team both as a whole and as individual members. Cyclops battles Mastermind on the psychic plane. Wolverine takes on a seemingly endless stream of Hellfire Club soldiers. Oh, and Jean Grey, as the Dark Phoenix, goes berzerk, eats a sun (killing an orbiting planet's entire population), and goes on trial for genocide. When Jean manages to gain control of herself for one short moment, she sacrifices herself to end the Dark Phoenix, dying in Cyclops' arms.Over the course of the next few years (and several retcons), some of the pivotal moments would later be backtracked to bring back Jean and the Phoenix Force, but none of it has managed to cheapen or take away from the original classic.Buy: AmazonAt this point, if you don't know about Infinity Gauntlet - the seminal Marvel Comics event that took the lead on our poll of the best Marvel stories by a wide margin - you simply haven't been paying attention.Bringing together basically all of Marvel's heroes at the time to take on the existential threat of Thanos the Mad Titan and his quest for the Infinity Stones, which hold the power to remake reality itself, Infinity Gauntlet tells the story of what happens when the heroes actually fail - a somewhat unprecedented story at the time.Of course, the heroes manage to overcome their defeat and win the day, restoring the universal destruction caused by Thanos, but not before the entire landscape of the Marvel Universe is changed by the experience - and not entirely for the better.Infinity Gauntlet has it all - an unbeatable foe, an incredible creative team in Jim Starlin, George Perez, and Ron Lim, and a conglomeration of the world's greatest heroes involved in cosmic action with the highest stakes possible.Even if you haven't read Infinity Gauntlet (and you should!), you probably know some of the story's broad strokes from its two-part MCU adaptation as Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.Buy: AmazonLove comics but don't know where to start?

Despite their ability to reign as the leading market share publisher throughout a turbulent time, there’s no question Marvel *knows* they’re in need of a new perception. The question remains whether they can quite settle in on an answer for how to correct course.As you may remember, all the way back in the previous age of October 2017, Marvel announced “Marvel Legacy,” their newest linewide banner. Legacy promised a DC-Rebirth esque oversized one-shot by Jason Aaron and Esad Ribic (among various others), and uh, old numbering? Despite this tantalizing combination, Legacy barely made it three months into 2018 before Marvel announced May would bring a very on-the-nose “Fresh Start.”As a result, 2018 promises to be pretty clearly divided into two halves, with the best of the first half rounding out the end of Marvel Legacy, and the remainder of the year building Marvel’s “Fresh Start.” These are the best comics Marvel has released in 2018!All-New All-Different MarvelComic Book Herald is reader-supported.

The Jane Foster/Thor era, with incredibly talented artist Russell Dauterman, reigns as one of the most public and successful products of Marvel’s “All-New All-Different” linewide blowup.Hardcore fans of the Odinson will be pleased to know the Jane era came to an effective, heartfelt conclusion this year, in what was year-in and year-out one of the best books in the Marvel lineup.Joined by Secret Wars: Weirdworld creative partner Mike Del Mundo, Aaron is far from finished with the world of Thor and Asgard.Black Panther has been and will continue to be one of Marvel’s most interesting comics so long as Ta-Nehesis Coates is writing the title. For my money, the Legacy era of Black Panther took a muted step back, but so far this series has paid dividends when consumed in bingeable chunks. I have no reason to believe otherwise with Black Panther in 2018!The Donny Cates Rising Superstar tour reached fever pitch with the writer’s work on a single Thanos story arc titled “Thanos Wins.” The immensely entertaining future-flung narrative benefited from a broader increase in Thanos’ profile due to Avengers: Infinity War, as well as the fact that it’s extremely entertaining marvel playground insanity.From cosmic ghost rider to all sorts of Marvel cosmic mash-ups I can’t even talk about without spoiling, “Thanos Wins” is already assured a spot in the best Thanos comics pantheon.Speaking of Cates, his time writing Doctor Strange didn’t generate quite the same amount of Infinity War laden hype as “Thanos,” but that’s a bit like saying Doctor Strange isn’t *quite* the same measure of sorcerer as Loki, the new sorcerer supreme. Wait, what?For my money, Cates’ storytelling choices are even more interesting in Doctor Strange, reviving the long gone presence of a Marvel 2000’s mainstay, and developing the lasting legacy of Bates the ghost dog. Plus, the first story arc features the art of Vision artist Gabriel Hernandez-Walta!Writer Christina Strain delivers teenage X-angst at its best.Although technically 75% of the series was published in 2017, Saladin Ahmed and Christian Ward’s work on Black Bolt is too good to keep off the 2018 best of list. I’ve suggested as much before, but it’s amazing how *good* Inhumans comics have been during the already forgotton MCU bomb that was ABC’s Inhumans. Black Bolt is the cream of the crop, cementing Ahmed and Ward as two of the most talented figures in comic book storytelling, and cementing the Absorbing Man and Titania as one of the most compelling romances in Marvel comics!I had tunnel-beneath-the-basement expectations for this miniseries, but it continues the Inhumans broader hot streak of excellent comics!To be fair, Marvel fans are hard up for Fantastic Four comics after the series (admittedly *very* effective) conclusion at the end of Secret Wars. Nonetheless, the Thing and Human Torch team-up series is everything I wanted and more, sporting writing from Chip Zdarsky and art from Jim Cheung. Best of all, Marvel 2 in 1 annual #1 merges the Infamous Iron Man (aka Doctor Doom) with the results of Secret Wars and Jonathan Hickman’s time writing Fantastic Four. It’s a continuity dream come true!The Tom Taylor tribute hour continues, as his new X-Men team book with Mahmud Asrar is the best X-Men title Marvel’s had in years.Every time I sort my comics collection I give some thought to future use. Will I read these again? Will my kids? You Are Deadpool might be the surest bet to get endless hours of use by future generations. If you happen to find these “role-playing game” comics at your local comic shop, I highly, highly recommend checking them out for a completely different Marvel Comics reading experience. I have a hard time imagining the experience playing as well on digital, too, so splurge for print if you can!Al Ewing and Joe Bennet’s post Civil War 2, post Secret Empire resurrection of Bruce Banner as the Hulk is both one of the best Marvel comics of the year, and flat out one of the best comics of 2018. What happens when Bruce Banner finally accepts that he can die, but the Hulk can’t.The creative team of Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman have boasted their Venom is better than Watchmen, and while that’s patently absurd, I’ll be darned if I’m not going to admit Watchmen doesn’t have symbiote dragons.The Kate Bishop era of Hawkeye concluded with issue #18, and Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero managed to deliver one of the best superhero comics of the past 2 years. Thompson’s writing of Bishop leverages the Fraction, Aja, Wu era as a launching pad, placing the Young Avenger in her element as a west coast private eye.I wasn’t sure what to expect from the Runaways relaunch, but the creative team of Rainbow Rowell and Kris Anka have quickly turned the franchise into one of Marvel’s finest. Everything about this series just looks and feels like the Runaways at their best, honestly not seen at this level since the Brian K. Vaughan and Adrian Alphona days in the early 2000’s.Filed Under: Best of Lists, Featured Tagged With: 2018, MarvelIf you like Comic Book Herald, and are able to donate, any small contribution will help keep CBH alive and full of new comics guides and content.

      "Xavier A Barrios D says March 18, 2019 at 4:25 amThank you once again, Dave. I follow your “best of the year” lists every 365 days, and have been doing so for some time now. Thanks to you, I’ve been introduced to so many great storylines I wouldn’t have otherwise. Unfortunately, and as it seems to happen more and more often in recent years. I didn’t like most of these titles. The only ones I truly enjoyed were the first few numbers of 2 in 1, and of course, Immortal Hulk. I seem to be stuck in the storylines of old, by Bendis, Hickman, Jenkins, David, Kyle and Yost. Whatever the case, I wouldn’t know any of those if it weren’t for your webpage. Again, thank you so much, and may we keep reading you for decades to come!\n",

As king of his home nation Wakanda, his fights are not in the streets but against threats to his throne, nation, and even the global geopolitical balance. With an extreme ability to hunt and combat, Black Panther sports a costume with features that in some cases, surpass the Iron Man armors and many Batsuits. A skilled acrobat and martial artist, Black Panther is able to run and move at incredible speeds, sense fear and lies, and see in total darkness.Year Created: 1966How he got his Powers: Having the juices of the Heart-Shaped Herb applied to his body.Weapons: Energy dagger, anti-metal clawsDid You Know?

Exiled from Wakanda after his father fell into a failed coup with Ulysses Klaue, N’Jadaka took on the name “Erik Killmonger” and attended MIT. After graduating, he returned home and set about dethroning the man who exiled him. Killmonger has already been dubbed one of the best villains on-screen, and there’s no wonder why.

In the comics, Groot originally appeared as an invader of Earth, capturing humans for experimentation. Superpowers: Marksmanship, assassin, marital artist, knife & sword master and expert pilot.Clint Barton has been an Avenger and agent for S.H.I.E.L.D for a reason – his remarkable and out of this world talent in marksmanship. Not a ‘superhero’ per se, but more of a normal guy with the superhuman ability to fire arrows and bows with extreme precision and accuracy; Hawkeye has helped defeat multiple enemies with his fine skills. He has spectacular eyesight and hand-eye coordination, can fire multiple arrows in a few seconds, and directly hit small targets in far distances. Hawkeye is also a master assassin and excellent martial artist. Year Created: 1964How he got his Powers: Trained his skills in marksmanshipWeapons: Bows and arrows Did You Know?

Advanced to be their operative, Bucky lived a violent and villain life. It wasn’t until he reunited with Rogers when he began to remember his past and turn to the good side again. Bucky’s bionic arm gives him superhuman strength, extended reach, and the ability to discharge bolts of electrical energy. He’s also a skilled martial artist, shield fighter, acrobat and expert spy and assassin.Year Created: 1941How got his Powers: Injected with the infinity formulaWeapons: Snipers, riflesDid You Know?

A hunter by instinct and skilled martial artist and swordsman, he perhaps knows more than any other mutant (thanks to his long life) how distrustful people can be. Wolverine’s strength is enough to break steel and lift weights that no normal human could. With animal-senses that can hear and see more than that of an ordinary person, a healing power like no other, and claws for days, Wolverine is one that goes down in history.Year Created: 1974How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: Adamantium claws, daggers, katana, guns Did You Know? As stated in our list of Batman facts, a Batman-Wolverine hybrid exists known as The Dark Claw!What order should you watch the Marvel movies?

Telekinesis, telepathy, and energy manipulation are just a few powers up Scarlet’s sleeves. Year Created: 1964How she got her Powers: Undergoing experiments at HYDRAWeapons: Her powersDid You Know? In the comics, Scarlet was introduced as a member of Magneto’s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, born with mutant powers.Superpowers: Superhuman strength & durability; density manipulation, flight, energy blasts, synthetic material generation, mental & computer interaction, genius-level intellect & master combatant.

His flexibility and relatability have seen him kick thugs in Queens and join the Avengers to space and beyond in equal measure. With heightened spider powers, this popular Marvel character can web-crawl, leap across buildings, fight like a pro, and sense danger stronger than the little creature itself.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers:  Bitten by a radioactive spider. Weapons: Web-shootersDid You Know?

No matter how many times he was banished from Asgard, he always came back with a plan to take the throne using his impressive magical skills.

Dr. Steven Strange started off as an arrogant, know-it-all neurosurgeon at the top of his field who had his hands ruined in a car crash. Stumbling into a world he would have scoffed at before, it’s Strange’s job to deal with all things magic and mystical. Considered the most powerful being in the Universe, Doctor Strange can manipulate energy and emit energy bolts strong enough to destroy planets. He is able to turn nearly-invisible, pass through solid materials, and teleport through time and dimensions. Strange can also fly using his Cloak of Levitation and has the power to hypnotise his enemies.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Studied and trained with the Ancient One.Weapons: Cloak of Levitation, Eye of Agamotto, Orb of Agamotto & moreDid You Know?

His heart is usually in the right place even if that has made him a bit of a jerk since taking on the role as mutant-kind’s leader figure. Cyclops is able to manipulate his optic eye blasts’ width, height and intensity with great skill. In fact, the blast is so strong, it can rip through mountains and it once even peeled off the Hulk’s skin.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: His visorDid You Know?

A series of transformations turned him into a furry blue cat/simian-faced hulk of a man. Don’t let the enormous slouching posture fool you, Hank much prefers to use his massive brains to solve problems and after a career in biochemistry is perhaps the most identifiable spokesman for mutant rights. Other than his brain, Beast has incredible superhuman strength, skills in acrobatic combat and can perform tasks with his feet or hands.

As a result of first trying to bond with Spider-Man, Venom is invisible to Spider-Sense, which for any Spider-foe is a free pass to knock the snot out of the web-head. When not tainted with anger-issues, Venom is not all bad as he deeply wants to be a hero. Although he does have the intimidating power to form spikes, use his sharp teeth and expand in size. In fact, he’s said to be stronger than Spider-Man himself.Year Created: 1984How he got his Powers: Eddie Brock became the alien’s new host.Weapons: Web-shootersDid You Know?

From such humble beginnings (and a talent for controlling the weather) she’s risen as a goddess of southern Africa, Xavier’s second in command, a queen of Wakanda and an inspiration for mutants everywhere young and old. She can control the weather, including the ability to generate lightning and tornadoes.

Thanks to his skills in hand-to-hand combat, vast experience in warfare, and ability to camouflage and tolerate extreme levels of pain, of course.

He even avoids taking painkillers to avoid drowsiness and slowed reflexes.Superpowers: Telepathy, can cause paralysis, memory loss, mental illusions, create mind bolts of psychic energy.Professor Charles Xavier was always one of the luckier mutants. He was able to easily hide his mutation while growing up, but that didn’t stop him from helping his kind out. Founding a school for gifted youngsters, Xavier is the most famous of mutantkind’s representatives, and his spokesmanship for mutant relations has been famously compared to Martin Luther King Jr – except this guy’s considered the world’s most powerful telepath. Xavier can telepathically communicate with anyone in the world, sense the locations of mutants, read minds and memories and manipulate and paralyze others to great extent.

Superpowers: Genius-level intellect, size-changing via Pym Particles, telepathic communication with insects, dimension-hopping.One of the first Avengers, Hank Pym is an eccentric genius who created Pym Particles, the exotic matter that can shrink and grow objects while retaining their proportionate strength. Taking on other names like Giant-Man, Goliath, Yellowjacket and even his own wife’s alias, The Wasp, he’s a bit unstable and prone to nervous breakdowns. That doesn’t take away his extraordinary abilities to shrink to the size of an ant, exceed in hand-to-hand combat, and grow to gigantic heights.Year Created: 1962How he got his Powers: Tested the Pym Particles serum on himselfWeapons: Stinger firearmDid you Know? Like Doctor Strange passes through multiverses, Ant-Man can travel through micro-versus – “tiny parallel dimensions”.Superpowers: Control of magnetic forces, magnetism-based flight, can make telepathic commands.The Master of Magnetism, leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants, closest friend of Charles Exavier, and possibly the world’s second most massive hypocrite. It’s hard to not feel sorry for a guy who survived the Nazi death camps but explaining Eric Lehnsherr, is no small feat. Though he certainly doesn’t make it easy with his plan to supplant humans with mutants as the dominant species on Earth. With his power to control metal and manipulate magnetic forces, there’s no going near this guy. Heck, he apparently can use magnetism to “raise islands from ocean floors and move mountains”.Year Created: 1963How he got his Powers: Mutant-bornWeapons: Helmet, powersDid You Know? Magneto has the power to move large asteroids and levitate a 30,000 ton nuclear submarine!Superpowers: Superhuman strength, flight, immunity to mind control.Vigilante private investigator, Jessica Jones is one of the fresher faces of Marvel’s roster.

King of Latveria Victor, von Doom is a complex sort, he may blame absolutely everything wrong with his life on Reed Richards (which is frequently his downfall), but he’s also worked with some of the heroes. In particular, he has enlisted the help of Doctor Strange to rescue his mother from Mephisto’s realm. The Doctor considers him one of the “most powerful practitioners of sorcery” thanks to his great ability to emit mystical blasts and force-fields, as well as cast spells.Year Created: 1962How he got his Powers: His mother’s Roma heritageWeapons: His powersDid You Know? In the comics, Doctor Doom has been depicted as one of the most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe.Superpowers: Peak-level human condition, martial arts expert, 10 Rings of Power.Tony Stark’s greatest opponent is not a rival CEO like Obidiah Stane or the Russians trying to copy his work, but this 100-year-old Chinese aristocrat.

He is technologically aided by the 10 Rings of Power alien technology he wears on each finger that through invention and practice, grant him numerous powers such as cryokinesis, electrokinesis, the ability to emit energy beams and blasts, levitation and mind control to say the least. Year Created: 1964How got his Powers: From the 10 Rings of PowerWeapons: 10 Rings of PowerDid You Know?

      "How do you pick the top 10 characters in all of Marvel U? Here's howMarvel currently boasts over 8,000 unique characters in its comic universe, but that's just quantity, not quality. Who are the best Marvel characters in all of its comic books, ever? That's the question we're looking at today.To answer, we delved into Marvel Comics' greatest stories (and even in the not-so-great ones). We also canvassed reader interest, as well as those of the comics professionals who work on these fictional characters.But this isn't a popularity contest either. We sat down and figured out who the best Marvel characters are based on their importance to Marvel and the Marvel Universe, their standing among fans, and most importantly, the stories that have been told about them and their character development over the years.Be prepared to find some of your favorite characters on our list, but also be prepared to be upset because some of your favorite characters didn't make the list. Ultimately, this is one person's opinion - and we look forward to you sharing your list with us on Twitter and Facebook. First appearance: Fantastic Four #52 (1966)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Black Panther comics The Black Panther is a different brand of superhero than most because he not only wears a heroic mantle, but also a crown; a crown that carries with it the weight of an entire nation. And, we're not being colorblind here - he's not white like most comic book heroes then (and now). Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in what later Marvel staffers said was an effort to feature Black superheroes in an era in which that was rare, the Black Panther was also an outsider to the Fantastic Four (and even the Avengers) and carried a dignified exoticism and connections to a near-mythical country that was refined and more technologically advanced than modern humanity at the time.But through works like recent stories by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and John Ridley with artists including Brian Stelfreeze, the Black Panther has grown into a complex, multi-faceted hero who struggles to be a better version of himself - and it's T'Challa's willingness to embrace and learn from his failures that sets him apart from many other ultra-competent heroes with all the resources in the world.The Black Panther sits in a unique place at Marvel - as the king of a nation who has recently realized that his own monarchy is at odds with democracy and the equal rights of his subjects, but who is still trying to find better ways to contribute to his home nation and Marvel's world at large.First appearance: The Incredible Hulk #180 (1974)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Wolverine comicsWolverine is the ultimate brooding loner. Combine that with a gritty tenacity and knives on (and in!) his hands, and you have a unique superhero cut from a very different cloth than those who came before him - who has carved himself a niche that countless characters have since tried to occupy.Wolverine entered the Marvel Universe like a classic Clint Eastwood western character - as a mysterious stranger who rides into town; short on words, long on violence. That profile has propagated an intense mystery about his past that continues to deepen even as creators try to fill in the blank pages of his history.And again, he's got knives on his hands - and it's actually cool, despite how silly the idea sounds on its face.Wolverine's catchphrase is 'The best there is at what he does.' And that's proven to be true, over and over again as imitators, variants, and clones (sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally) come and go.First appearance: The Savage She-Hulk #1 (1980)\n",
      "Recommended reading: She-Hulk by Soule & Pulido: The Complete CollectionShe-Hulk began comic book life as a way for Marvel to protect its turf. Originally a female knockoff of her famous cousin Bruce Banner AKA the Hulk, Jennifer Walters was created by Marvel to establish ownership of a female Hulk before CBS could create their own version as part of its then-contemporary Incredible Hulk TV show. But she quickly became more than a way to establish ownership of the concept in-house, eventually surpassing many of the most intrinsic qualities that make the original Hulk a great character himself - the juxtaposition of strength, anger, and the duality between the human being and rampaging monster. She-Hulk was also Deadpool before there was a Deadpool - a hyper-aware, sometimes metatextual, fourth-wall-breaking character who can fit in alongside other mainstream heroes without skipping a beat.From the novel idea of a lawyer specializing in superhero law to a successful businesswoman dealing with the realities (and fiction) of controlling (or not controlling) her anger issues, She-Hulk isn't a cliché or an archetype, which makes her one of top (eighth-best, actually) characters in the Marvel U.First appearance: The Fantastic Four #1 (1961)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Fantastic Four #51 (1966)The Thing is the heart of the Marvel Universe. That's right, beneath that orange, craggy exterior and gruff demeanor lies a wounded, underdog soul that was emblematic of the Marvel Universe in its earliest years. Unlike the Marvel we all know today, in the early '60s it was a more upstart publisher with dogged perseverance and individualistic spirit that made it stand out in the crowd. Yup, just like Big 'ol Ben.Unlike many powerhouses like Thor, Captain Marvel, and DC's Superman who are also easy on the eye, the superhuman strength that allows the Thing to trade punches with gods like Galactic comes with the price of a giant, lumbering, monster-like appearance. And that steep price has driven some of the greatest Marvel stories of all time like the classic 'This Man, This Monster.'But underneath his literally gruff exterior, Ben has the proverbial heart of gold, and it's the display of his human qualities - like playing pranks on Johnny Storm or his fierce loyalty to best friend Reed Richards - that contrast with his appearance and makes the Thing so endearing and enduring.Ben fits in the tapestry of the Marvel Universe like one of those patchwork pieces of his rock-like skin. And readers who were alive during the '70s know he along with Spider-Man were the face of Marvel during that decade. But even today the Thing is a keystone - the one piece in the proverbial arch that is the Marvel Universe that makes everything and everyone else around him work better.First appearance: Invincible Iron Man #55 (1973)\n",
      "Recommended reading: The Infinity Gauntlet (1991)Thanos is the kind of character that can be (and probably is) a case study in a  college psychology class. Inspired by the Greek god Thanatos and a heaping helping of Jack Kirby's New Gods (particularly Metron and Darkseid), Thanos' beginnings were humble (a throwaway Iron Man villain on a janky helicopter) but he developed and grew in stature through stories in Captain Marvel, Warlock, and Silver Surfer series to eventually reach his ultimate destiny in the seminal 1991 Marvel Comics event The Infinity Gauntlet.Birthed of regret and raised with animosity, the grown-up Thanos has an obsession with death (both the lower-case death and the actual Marvel entity Death) which has led him on a single-minded crusade for order - his order - in the Marvel Universe, often leading to body counts in the millions.All that power, it fits like a glove  ... or gauntlet ... in this case.Since then, Thanos has been Marvel's ultimate bad guy. Creator Jim Starlin and subsequent writers like Jonathan Hickman, Jason Aaron, Donny Cates, and Kieron Gillen have made him more than just a Jaws-like force of nature, adding depth and pathos -- while still keeping his proverbial teeth sharp and menacing.With his MCU role culminating in Avengers: Endgame, Thanos has reached an even higher level of stature to become one of the most iconic villains, and even, we daresay characters - good or evil - in all of popular fiction.First appearance: Giant-Size X-Men #1 (1975)\n",
      "Recommended reading: X-Men: LifedeathStrong women have been a mainstay of Marvel Comics - particularly in the X-Men - and Storm, without a doubt, is one of the strongest and hardest to break. Born in Harlem but forced to raise herself as a street thief in Egypt after becoming an orphan, she made a path for herself that included titles like a goddess, X-Men member, X-Men leader, queen of Wakanda, and now the ruler of Mars.While her mutant ability to control the weather is a pivotal part of her, thanks to the writers and artists that have added layers to her character, it's Storm the woman and her often dueling qualities of tenacity, anger, forgiveness, and compassion that have forged her into a titan of modern fiction and cemented her into the bedrock foundation of Marvel Comics most important characters.First appearance: Captain America Comics #1 (1941)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Captain America comicsCaptain America is a quintessential part of the Marvel Universe, but it took decades for him to reach that potential. One of the dozens of flag-waving patriotic superheroes created during the early  '40s during Second World War, it wasn't until the early 60s when he was thawed from an icy tomb in a story by Stan Lee and his co-creator Jack Kirby in an Avengers story that he started on the path to become who he is today.In that era he became an anachronistic version of Americana, battling the dark turns America can take. He wasn't the first US patriotic hero that carried a shield, but it's those more modern stories that made everyone forget who the other guy was (Archie Comics' The Shield, by the way, created months before Captain America).Although not a founding member of the Earth's Mightiest Heroes, he quickly became the face of the team which for many readers added to his profile as the classical heroic ideal for Marvel's brand of superheroes. Chris Evans' portrayal of Cap in MCU films over 60 years after the character's creation only raised his stature further. While comic book Captain America is still as young and vital as always, Evan's live-action Cap will cast a shadow over the MCU for years to come, as evidenced by 2021's The Falcon & Winter Soldier Disney Plus streaming series and lingering rumors of Evan's return in some form or another.Captain America is not just a flagbearer for the United States, but for Marvel Comics as well - and that's something even fans that aren't from the US can (and do) appreciate.First appearance: Uncanny X-Men #129 (1980)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Uncanny X-Men #143 (1981) The X-Men are amazing - uncanny, even - but it wasn't until Kitty Pryde entered the picture that readers gained a real perspective of how uncanny. Created as a 'girl next door'/grounded character in the original Chris Claremont/John Byrne era, Shadowcat was a hit character from the start - and she only got better over the years.The secret? Unlike many young comic book heroes, she was allowed to grow up, and all of us readers could grow up with her.Kitty Pryde is one of the few characters that have significantly grown, matured, and evolved over the years - from a fresh-faced early teens student to a full-on adult team leader today. Even while she was in her teens and early adulthood, readers met hardened versions of her such as 'Days of Future Past's Kate Pryde and Excalibur's Widget. But she also grew up for real in such touchstone series as Kitty Pryde: Agent of SHIELD, Mechanix, and especially the current Marauders ongoing.Of all the mutant characters, Kitty Pryde has proven to be the most human when it comes to evolution and growth, And that doesn't just make it stand out among her fellow X-Men, but among the entire Marvel Comics pantheon as well.First appearance: Fantastic Four #5 (1962)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Doctor Doom: The Book of Doom omnibus There's a common adage in fiction writing that also applies to life that villains think of themselves as the hero of their own story. That their motivations are noble and just even if the world sees them as misguided or evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Marvel Comics, there's no better example of the nobility of villainy than Doctor Doom.Like most of Marvel's greatest characters, Victor Von Doom has a tragic origin story - but whereas so many of Marvel's best characters overcame their tragedies to become superheroes, Doom took a different route. While his descent into supervillain is a thorn on the side of most of the Marvel Universe, Doom is not without a sense of honor and watching a complex, flawed, but at times noble and sometimes even regal character evolve, grow, and become steeled like the armor he wears is one of Marvel's greatest literary achievements.Whether it's fighting the Fantastic Four, Luke Cage, or the entire Marvel Multiverse, Doom is always the star (if not hero) of his own story - no matter whose logo is on the cover.First appearance: Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)\n",
      "Recommended reading: Best Spider-Man comicsSpider-Man redefined what a superhero could be, and although many have followed in his footsteps, he's still number one, definitively at Marvel and arguably anywhere else.Spider-Man works because he's the plucky undersized street-level teen underdog with a heart of gold - burdened with great regrets but gifted with an eternal desire to do better, for himself and others. In a world of mostly adult superheroes who seemingly have their life all figured out, Peter Parker works because whether as a teen or young adult, he's both who we all are and some of us want to be - flawed but trying, always punching upward and reaching a hand to help those who need it.Add to it his quirky but mesmerizing costume design by Steve Ditko and the nearly-trademark ways he and his powers are visually depicted in comic books (and later in television, film, and video games), what you have is not just one of the world's most famous superheroes, but one of the most unique characters in modern fiction of any medium.So why is Spider-Man deserving of being not just on a list of Marvel's best characters but alone on the top spot? Because what Ditko and Stan Lee created back in 1962 is constantly being fine-tuned, revisited, and remade in a way that keeps him current yet classic. Today you can still tell a Spider-Man story about the awkward teen learning to exist in a world of adult superheroes and villains, while also telling a story about the Peter Parker who's been married and a father, or a corporate CEO, or in the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and the MCU's Spider-Man: No Way Home, a mentor to a younger Spider-Man.Spidey is Marvel's best character because he was, and is, and probably always will be the most interesting character in any supervillain battle or superhero team-up, and his stories speak to the generations of comic readers who have grown up with him - and a generation that is growing up with him now.Chris Arrant covered comic book news for Newsarama from 2003 to 2022 (and as editor/senior editor from 2015 to 2022) and has also written for USA Today, Life, Entertainment Weekly, Publisher's Weekly, Marvel Entertainment, TOKYOPOP, AdHouse Books, Cartoon Brew, Bleeding Cool, Comic Shop News, and CBR.

The religious zealot at the heart of this grand tale raises the stakes for the X-Men and all of mutantkind.Frank Miller’s legendary status is due in part to his run on the Daredevil comics during the 1980s.

With his identity known by the Kingpin menace and his life in more danger than ever before, Daredevil must overcome his mental anguish and fight for survival.When Marvel’s most influential heroes work alongside each other, you can’t help but root for them in their fight for justice.

In “Kraven’s Last Hunt,” the fearless warrior embarks upon a final feat in order to defeat his greatest adversary.

Once Spidey escapes from Kraven’s grasp, he sets out to take back his role as the city’s savior.One of the most intriguing parts of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier Disney+ series is the way in which it explained the earliest example of super soldiers and the horrible acts committed by the U.S. government towards one of its patriots.

Try one of our products today and save 10% on your entire order!With thousands of heroes and villains in total with their title series in Marvel Comics, it can be quite intimidating to dabble into this area of the universe.As a certified Marvel fan, we’re here to tell you the best Marvel Comics and what makes them stand out from the other titles on the shelf. We join the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy on their latest adventures out in space, from pulling off their biggest heists to getting caught in the fight between the Collector and Grandmaster. There are also more hilarious stories within the comic book, such as why Drax has sworn off violence forever and why Groot can’t grow bigger. These Marvel comics were so popular that they were translated into two Marvel movies on the big screen! It was in 1962’s Amazing Fantasy comic book when Spider-Man was first introduced in the Marvel Universe. Before all of the ostentatious exposure he got teaming up with the Avengers, Peter was just a regular high schooler who gets bit by a radioactive spider. He stubbornly lets a thief run away, saying “he’s done being pushed around by anyone,” who later on kills his Uncle Ben. He recognizes the magnitude of his power and continues to learn why “with great power comes great responsibility.” In the tear-jerking The Night Gwen Stacy Died Marvel comic book, the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacy and uses her to lure Spidey to the Brooklyn Bridge. When Goblin and Spidey clash, Gwen gets hurled off the side of the bridge. Spidey shoots his web out and catches her but discovers she is dead. He blames himself for her death and seeks revenge on the Green Goblin but finds he cannot kill him. What happened to Gwen Stacy was revolutionary to Marvel history and other comic books as important characters were rarely killed off, much less the protagonist’s girlfriend. This case gave way to the birth of the Gwen Stacy Syndrome when wives or girlfriends of heroes suffered some grim fate. Also Read: When Did Disney Purchase Marvel Studios?Marvel: Annihilation is a crossover miniseries featuring the best stories of the lives of outer-space characters in the Marvel Universe. Thanos, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Annihilus, Galactus, and others are some of the stories this series follows. The X-Men go head-to-head against the supervillain Shadow King [1], who can control minds and get under the skin of many of our psychic heroes. He wants to use the X-Men to help him get back to the physical realm. Discontent with only the psychic heroes, he spreads his psychic powers all over London to possess its citizens as well. Several Marvel Avengers comic books have been present previously, but a few of them, including Mighty, New, Dark, and the Initiative, has been canceled to make way for the modern Avengers series released in 2010. In the Heroic Age of Marvel Comics, our favorite Avengers team gets into an epic battle of heroes and villains to save Earth from catastrophic threats. Also Read: Thor vs Captain MarvelThe Marvel: Black Panther comics are written by National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates. T’Challa is challenged by The People, a superhuman terrorist group, who aims to spark a revolution among the people in Wakanda and turn them against their king. T’Challa must choose to stand by tradition or do what is right by his people as their ruler. Steve Rogers is back in his own Marvel comics with a new shield, new teammates, and a new mission… working as an agent for Hydra. In this alternate timeline, we see how Captain America set up the stage during the Civil War, the nature of his relationship with the Winter Soldier, and how Hydra had taken an interest in him and fostered him ever since he was a child to make him their strongest Secret Soldier. In the Marvel: Civil War comic book series, our favorite superheroes are forced to perform missions with the law supervising them after a reality show literally bombs and kills over 600 people, including young students. The public turns against superhumans, calling them villains and freaks of nature. The biggest heroes Captain America and Iron Man take on opposing sides and recruit their team members, including Winter Soldier, Ant-Man, and the rest of the Avengers. This was adapted into the big screen, starring Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America. Also Read: Black Widow ComicsMarvel Comics Daredevil: Born Again uses plenty of Catholic themes throughout the story. Writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli have received praise for their work, and it is considered one of the best, if not the best, Daredevil storylines. When his ex-girlfriend Karen Page sells his identity out to the Kingpin, Matt Murdock is left homeless after his home gets firebombed and bankrupt after the IRS froze all his accounts. He confronts the Kingpin but gets badly beat up. His unconscious body gets strapped to the back of a taxi that was pushed into the East River, but he wakes up just in time to swim to safety and makes his way to Hell’s Kitchen. There, he is found by his long-lost mother, Maggie, who serves as a nun in a Catholic church. Read: How Strong is Captain MarvelThe Darth Vader comics begin with Anakin Skywalker completely falling to the dark side of the Force and becoming Darth Vader to prevent the death of his wife as promised by Palpatine. Obi-Wan Kenobi kills him, but Palpatine retrieves his body and puts it inside a cybernetic armor to revive it. He eventually wakes up with nothing but pain and rage and wreaks havoc on the entire universe. Wisecracking Deadpool is back in his latest comic book series that old and new fans will come to love equally. This story gives us a fresh look at the character and what exactly makes him well-loved -- even more than Spidey (or so Deadpool thinks). In the Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again comics, MODOK uses special programming to control Deadpool into thinking that the Avengers Unity are his enemies. The character proceeds to kill all of them without hesitation, which leads a group of heroes, including breakout star Jessica Jones, Hawkeye, and Punisher, to investigate what is happening. We learn that Red Skull, Abomination, Doctor Doom, and Magneto are behind the MODOK programming. Written by Marvel geniuses Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, The Coming of Galactus tells the story of the Silver Surfer as he was working for Galactus, a cosmic entity who fed on planets to sustain his life source. The Fantastic Four notice that the skyline seems to be burning, leaving a trail of debris, which they closely examine. A powerful being named the Watcher appears and tells them that he has attempted to conceal the Earth’s presence from the Silver Surfer. The herald notices Earth hidden anyway and alerts Galactus. The edition’s cliffhanger ending shows us the cosmic entity declaring his intention to devour Earth, with the Fantastic Four on standby, ready to defend the world.  Written by major players in the comic book world Jim Starlin, George Perez, and Ron Lim, the Infinity Gauntlet story starts with Mistress Death resurrecting Thanos to correct a perceived imbalance of life forces. Because the Titan wanted to earn her good graces, Thanos collected all six Infinity Stones and attached them to his Gauntlet to do her bidding, but still, Death rejected him. The Mad Titan angrily wiped away half of all living beings. Doctor Strange summons all of the surviving heroes to defeat Thanos but fails. Because Thanos was under the impression that he’d all but defeated his enemies, he left his body and assumed an astral form, which eventually gave his daughter Nebula a chance to steal the Gauntlet and restore the universe to its previous condition. Also Read: Best Way To Watch the Marvel MoviesInfinity War has a total of six issues and is the sequel to Infinity Gauntlet by Jim Starlin. Adam Warlock takes possession of the Gauntlet and uses it to expel the evil side from his being, creating a completely different persona called Magus. Magus ran amok and created evil doppelgangers of Earth’s mightiest heroes. Old Man Logan is set in an alternate universe wherein the villains emerge victorious over superheroes. Superheroes have been all but extinct, with a few in hiding. Logan lives in Hulkland, part of California, with his family, but times are getting tough, and he needs money to pay rent to his landlords. He accepts a job from a blind Clint Barton to assist him in traveling east to deliver a package. When he gets back home, he discovers the Hulk Gang had killed his family due to their overdue rent payment. Wolverine unleashes his long-dormant claws and kills off every Hulk family member, not noticing that one family member was left. Together with baby Hulk, Wolverine says he plans to defeat all the new world villains to bring peace to the land and starts the modern Marvel superheroes with two new warriors. Peter Parker is back in New York for the Marvel: Spectacular series. This story is a take on the classic 1960s tale, with humorous dialogue and exciting fights with villains. He teams up with classic favorites like Iron Heart and Human Torch to take down Vulture, Kingpin, and other nostalgic villains. Read: Some Marvel Painting IdeasSecret Empire is a ten-issue modern Marvel storyline centering around Hydra’s control over Captain America. They made him believe that he was acting as a sleeper agent and setting the stage for Team Hydra to take over the world. There are nine issues in the Marvel: Secret Wars series, whose storylines center around the Marvel Universe's destruction and many different alternate universes. Each has its version of Earth, which combines in a planet called the Battleworld. Since there are many different Earths from many different universes, there are multiple versions of our favorite superheroes. It’s interesting to see how vastly different they are -- from their powers, personalities, and histories -- from the ones we are familiar with in the Marvel Universe. The 2016 modern Marvel edition tells us the story of Miles Morales, a biracial teen of Black American and Puerto Rican descent. He possesses powers similar to Peter's after being bitten by a spider infused with a formula created from Parker’s blood. He is unhappy about having powers; at the same time, his father also mistrusts superheroes, so he does not say anything. He gets in touch with Parker’s friends and loved ones, such as Gwen Stacy, Mary-Jane Watson, and even May Parker, who inspires him and tells him why Peter did what he did, and finally assumes the masked superhero role. The evilest villain in the Marvel Universe is back in his title series. He seeks vengeance on everyone who opposed him, especially the Avengers. This series is clever and interesting because we see destruction through the eyes of Thanos and learn of his reasoning on why he does what he does, with a great showdown on heroes and villains in its climax. Read: What's the Best Gift For a Marvel Fan?The first-ever issue of The Amazing Spider-Man by Steve Ditko, John Romita, and Stan Lee was released over 50 years ago in 1963. It tells the story of how Peter Parker juggles life as a high school student, son, and freelance photographer while saving the people of New York as the web-shooting masked crimefighter. Ultimate Spider-Man is a telling of the original story Marvel fans adore. A young Peter is orphaned at six years old and gets bitten by a radioactive spider, giving him superhuman powers and a “spidey sense,” which warns him of impending danger. He learns the gravity of the phrase “with great power comes great responsibility,” and tries his best to do good. Weapon X is a clandestine program conducted by Department K in Canada that experiments on both mutants and humans. In this story, mutants are turned into weapons by further enhancing their powers, while humans are mutated in order to give them powers. Plenty of funding and research are given to this program to kill none other than their high-stake target, Wolverine. Legion, son of Professor X, decides to travel back in time to kill Magneto before he can start committing heinous crimes. Little did he know, he travels to a time when Magneto and Professor X were still friends, and Professor X died saving his friend. This sacrifice results in Magneto having a change of heart and following through with Professor X’s vision, which was humans and mutants coexisting peacefully. Apocalypse, a time-traveling immortal mutant, rules over the world and sees that all humans are killed as revenge for the past. X-Men: Blue is a bi-weekly publication with 36 issues from 2017 to 2018. This series follows the aftermath of the Inhumans vs. X-Men war, wherein the five original X-Men, including Marvel Girl, Cyclops, Beast, Iceman, and Angel, are looking to bring mutant criminals down to bring justice to their team. In the Days of Future Past story, we see a dystopian present-day United States ruled by Sentinels, who hunted and tracked down mutants all over the world to place them in internment camps and kill them via a nuclear holocaust. The few remaining members of the X-men send Kate Pryde back in time to stop a defining event that greatly contributed to the present happenings. Unlike X-Men: Blue, the Gold team features newer heroes spearheaded by Shadowcat, or Kitty Pryde. Along with Colossus, Storm, Nightcrawler, Prestige, and Old Man Logan, she is on a mission to become Earth’s heroes and defend the same people who hate and fear them because of the traumatic events of the Inhumans vs. X-Men battle. Written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, the Dark Phoenix Saga story revolves around Jean Grey, who gets exposed to the deadly radiation of a solar flare. She attains the highest power of telepathy and telekinesis called the Phoenix Force. She then assumes the identity of Phoenix, a being of pure thought, and makes her a target for Mastermind, who successfully controls and manipulates her and the Phoenix Force to do his bidding. To this day, the Dark Phoenix saga remains one of the best stories about the X-men. Our best advice for those planning to get into Marvel Comics is to pick one superhero and story you know and start there. Personally, we loved reading Iron Man comics simply because of the familiarity of the stories. And sure, some things in the Marvel comics have been told differently in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and TV series, so you may have to unlearn some stories along the way. Marvel Comics hasn’t released an official record of all of its comic book titles, so the best we could come up with is an estimate. In 2009 -- about ten years ago -- Marvel reported having 32,000 comics in its arsenal, which is about 450 per year since they released their first issue in 1939. Multiply 450 by ten, and you’ll have about 36,000 comics in total, more or less. Suppose you read all 36,000 issues of Marvel Comics. Each Marvel comic has around 60 to 68 pages, which we presume an average person finishes in about 15 minutes. If readers spent 24 hours everyday reading, it would take them a year (375 days) to finish all the Marvel Comics. Of course, you have to sleep and eat, so consider that, too. Marvel comics is a wide universe filled with rich stories of heroes and villains. There’s a reason why they’ve been around since the 1930s -- their stories are gripping, touching, and heartwarming. With clever dialogue and colorful sketches, it would seem like the Marvel characters are leaping off the pages as you read. If you’re interested in Marvel Comics merch, check out our listings! References: Connecting people with their favorite pop-culture products every day.\n",

I think everyone would agree, including Comic Book Publishers, Writers, Artists, and Editors alike. The big companies have had to make cutbacks, distributors have had setbacks, and physical stores have struggled to find their place throughout the new normal of COVID. However, even with these conflicts, amazing stories have still been pumped out by some of the very best creators and thinkers in comics today. Sure, we’ve all strived to find our new normal. Nevertheless, comics have been there throughout all of this as an escape from the everyday trials and hardships that are ever impacting the entire planet.With that said, this article is more of a thank you to Marvel Comics, its writers, its artists, and its entire staff for the hard work they’ve done throughout this entire year. It takes a village to raise a child. And, it takes an army to make a great comic. So, here is my “BEST OF MARVEL COMICS” for the year 2020. Before I begin, let me once again say “Thank you” to everyone at Marvel from the publicists to the writers and everyone between. Without all of you, 2020 would have been so much more unbearable.Now, this commentary could focus on so much more. However, I’m just going to hit on three key areas: Writer of the Year, Artist of the Year, and Book of the Year all at Marvel Comics. Sprinkled in, I will hand out some honorable mentions to spice up the article. Again, everyone at Marvel deserves some praise. Nonetheless, the individuals I name are who I think were at the top of their game in 2020. Amazon Links will be attached for you to snag all of these outstanding comics and work from these artists and writers. I hope you enjoy it and God Bless!Let’s begin with some honorable mentions. The first artist on my shortlist would be German Peralta. This year he’s worked on STRIKEFORCE and MAESTRO with some KING IN BLACK items on the horizon. Now, I wasn’t a huge fan of STRIKEFORCE. Still, that had nothing to do with the art. With MAESTRO as his main focus, Peralta has done a stellar job locking this reviewer into the series with some extremely monumental illustrations that are almost next level involving the Hulk. Another honorable mention goes to Stephen Segovia for his work on HELLIONS, CONAN SERPENT WAR, EMPYRE: X-MEN, and GIANT-SIZE X-MEN: A TRIBUTE TO WEIN AND COCKRUM. His style is very distinctive and incredibly vibrant which ultimately lends itself well to the unique X-team in HELLIONS.Continuing with more honorable mentions, there is Nic Klein (who mainly focused on THOR) and Phil Noto who spread his artistic chops throughout the Marvel Landscape in 2020 from DR. STRANGE, CABLE, X-MEN, and a variety of covers including STAR and SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: ALIEN REALITY. Together, these two both added their extraordinary artistic mark on their respective comics. Noto’s almost painted, yet overly realistic style of our favorite heroes appears natural, sometimes muddy, but exceptionally rich and textured. However, on the other hand, Klein’s THOR is sharp, bright, crisp, and almost surreal. Each artist offers something different to their respective comics that helped drive their stories to the top of my list in 2020. Nevertheless, the award for BEST ARTIST AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to Joe Bennett!Joe Bennett, known primarily for THE IMMORTAL HULK, THE IMMORTAL SHE-HULK, and a variety of covers from MAESTRO to KING IN BLACK: IMMORTAL HULK, exudes his own frightfully violent style that’s scary good. Bennett is what has made THE IMMORTAL HULK such a huge success and has morphed everyone’s favorite Green Goliath into a horror comic. Readers, some of Bennett’s illustrations are so graphic and so unnerving, that I strongly recommend you don’t read THE IMMORTAL HULK at bedtime. In each issue, Bennett’s illustrations become more and more vivid, violent, and grotesque… but in such a way that truly amplifies the narrative. This year, Dispatch’s award for Artist of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the brilliantly talented Joe Bennett. If you’re not reading his comics, you need to get them on your pull list ASAP!Just like Artist of the Year, let’s kick things off with some honorable mentions. I’m going, to begin with, one of my all-time favorite writers, Jonathan Hickman. This year, The Head of X, strung together X-MEN, parts of NEW MUTANTS, multiple GIANT-SIZE X-MEN, and pioneered X OF SWORDS. Now, X OF SWORDS was… ok… but it was no HOXPOX, which is ultimately why I can’t give my boy Hickman the title this year.Continuing with my honorable mentions, let me focus on the “first-class” of X-Men writers this year: Ben Percy, Gerry Duggan, and Zeb Wells. Percy led the charge immediately after Hickman with X-FORCE, WOLVERINE, WEAPON PLUS: WORLD WAR 4, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and he even dabbled on MARAUDERS with CARNAGE: BLACK, WHITE, AND BLOOD on the horizon for 2021. His hands are all over Marvel Comics write now and that makes this comic fan extremely happy. He’s the perfect fit for WOLVERINE and X-FORCE championing some truly intriguing stories while keeping the character’s voices intact. He’s a genuine rock star at Marvel right now and I can’t wait to see what he has on deck for 2021.Now, if Percy is Hickman’s right-hand man, then Duggan is unequivocally his left-hand man. Duggan, who’s managed MARAUDERS, SAVAGE AVENGERS, CABLE, WOLVERINE: BLACK, WHITE, AND BLOOD, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and even contributed on WOLVERINE, has become a staple to Marvel Comics. His take on Kitty Pryde is outstanding. Plus, Duggan has taken the extremely unlikeable concept of Kid Cable and made him digestible and interesting. Readers, that’s a task I wouldn’t wish on any writer, yet Duggan has done it masterfully. Additionally, he’s had the amazing opportunity of weaving CONAN THE BARBARIAN into the modern Marvel Landscape within the pages of SAVAGE AVENGERS, which is such a fun title everyone should be reading. I just can’t say enough about Duggan.Now, I know these honorable mentions have been extremely X-MEN centric, however, it can’t go overlooked without mentioning Zeb Wells and the work he’s done this year with ANT-MAN, HELLIONS, EMPYRE: X-MEN, X OF SWORDS, and SPIDER-HAM. Readers, HELLIONS is no doubt my surprise series of the year. After some epic flops like FALLEN ANGELS, I wasn’t expecting much from the series. Nevertheless, HELLIONS and Wells are a true delight. His take on Mister Sinister is the perfect blend of snarky, sarcastic cynicism that I never knew I needed in my pull list. Plus, the band of Misfits he’s put together makes for a wildly fetching team. Give HELLIONS a look and let me know what you think!Nevertheless, even after all of these honorable mentions that were remarkably X-MEN heavy, my writer of the year has absolutely nothing to do with the X-MEN. This year, the award for BEST WRITER AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to Peter David! David, who’s spearheaded so many original titles like SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: KING IN BLACK, SYMBIOTE SPIDER-MAN: ALIEN REALITY, and MAESTRO, has been a breath of fresh air this year for both Peter Parker and Bruce Banner. Sure, these stories take place in alternate realities. But, both take aspects of the characters that David wrote many moons ago and has found a way to traverse these ideas into the future of Marvel Comics.Both of these stories are utterly fascinating, incredibly entertaining, and exceedingly creative. Almost every issue of each of these titles has been a spectacular hit. For the older fan, these have elements of nostalgia mixed with a new age twist that show David hasn’t lost a step. I highly recommend any newer reader to check some of Peter David’s past work out. He’s been in the business for quite some time and I think you’ll be pleased with what you find. This year, Dispatch’s award for Writer of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the dazzlingly talented Peter David. If you’re not reading his comics, you need to get them on your pull list ASAP!Marvel fans, this award is always more difficult to hand out each year. There are always some series that just start towards the end of a year, as well as some comics that ended early on in which we all forget. Plus, I place my criteria on this award that also entails a bit of longevity. Meaning, I try to only hand this award out to a series that’s been around for a minimum of 6-8 issues. That said. I would just like to mention one of my favorite titles in which I’m giving an honorable mention simply because it falls short of my criteria. Otherwise, it may have won the award. And that comic is MAESTRO by Peter David. This book has been an action-packed, nonstop success. It’s done so well that David is continuing the series this month with MAESTRO: WAR AND PAX. David takes his FUTURE IMPERFECT story and gives it a “prequel” with a spin. If you haven’t read it, get the MAESTRO trade and tell your shop you want MAESTRO: WAR AND PAX on your pull list. Additionally, if the concept of an evil, tyrant Hulk is new to you, grab the FUTURE IMPERFECT trade! You won’t be disappointed.The next honorable mention that fits the bill is DAREDEVIL by Chip Zdarsky. Now, Zdarsky is also one of my favorite writers right now. However, I merely didn’t put him in my writer’s honorable mention because he’s only done DAREDEVIL and X-MEN/ FANTASTIC FOUR this year. And let me tell you, I was very unimpressed with X-MEN/ FANTASTIC FOUR. Nonetheless, DAREDEVIL has been cerebral, unique, emotional, and massively significant to the character Matt Murdock. Murdock has changed drastically and has been battling some demons all year. And the irony, Zdarsky is more known for his humor and wit. However, some of the very best comics he’s ever written have been so emotionally charged. I can’t say enough about this title that has slid to the top of my pull every month. I won’t spoil the story for you BUT I will tell you to grab some DAREDEVIL trades posthaste! Zdarsky is such a gifted writer that truly deserves our praise this year.My last set of honorable mentions will solely be a group of titles… and those titles are X-MEN, X-FORCE, and WOLVERINE. These titles, forerun by Jonathan Hickman and Ben Percy are the top dogs of X-Men Comics at Marvel. Simply put: these are the three titles that you must read if you’re an X-fan. Sure, I do like many other titles. Nevertheless, if you had to make cuts in a time where money is tight, these are the three X-titles to grab. X-MEN is the flagship book that helps maintain the status quo each month written by the Head of X, Jonathan Hickman himself. This series gives you Cyclops, Jean, Magneto, Xavier, and the rest of the Quiet Council in all its glory. Ben Percy leads the charge with the two most high octane X-titles on the market in X-FORCE and WOLVERINE. Both of these titles have Logan (a fan favorite) deeply engaged and both titles focus on the war that’s been raging with humanity since HOXPOX and the creation of Krakoa. Furthermore, the best titles involved in the X OF SWORDS crossover event also happened to be these three titles as well.So, with all honorable mentions aside, my book of the year happens to be the very same as 2019. This year, the award for BOOK OF THE YEAR AT MARVEL COMICS for 2020 goes to THE IMMORTAL HULK! Now, I know what many of you are probably thinking… why? Other than Joe Bennett, you’ve barely mentioned anything about this title throughout the article. Well, let me start by saying Bennett is a huge reason as to why this comic is so dang successful. Without him, this series would be typical and ordinary. It’s Bennett that makes this series almost transcendent.Many would argue that if THE IMMORTAL HULK is your book of the year, then Al Ewing should have made your honorable mentions for writers. This is true. And, I struggled with that concept myself. However, this was the only work of his that I rather enjoyed. Plus, he had his fair shake at an event this year in EMPYRE that was a bit lackluster in my opinion. However, when Ewing has the opportunity to focus on one specific character and mold it to his will, he always does a fantastic job, which is the case in THE IMMORTAL HULK.Readers, Bennett and Ewing are doing something special here. Furthermore, how often has a creative team been on a book that’s been consistently on fire? Hardly ever! When THE IMMORTAL HULK graced the pages at Marvel, it was a genuine Fresh Start that’s continued 40 issues later. This series is scheduled to end at issue 50 and I for one am not looking forward to that day. Many recent writers at multiple companies have tried to write their 100 issues of a character (cough… cough… Tom King). However, their stories ebbed and flowed worse than a rollercoaster ride.THE IMMORTAL HULK has had very few duds in its over 40 issue run. It’s got action, suspense, thrills, and amazing cliffhangers that keep you coming back for more. It’s taken average B to C list characters and weaved them into the story as key players within the narrative while developing the multiple personalities inside Banner in the process. It’s explosive, diabolical, and volatile with the art telling just as much of the story, if not more than the writer. This year, Dispatch’s award for Book of the Year at Marvel Comics for 2020 goes to the bizarrely masterful IMMORTAL HULK. If you’re not reading this series, you need to get it on your pull list before it’s too late! And even if it’s too late, grab the trades ASAP!It’s been one heck of a year. I don’t think anyone would disagree. Even at Marvel Comics, we’ve seen a plant verse zombie verse human space war in EMPYRE, a Mortal Kombat style tournament that has ushered in hundreds of new mutants in X OF SWORDS, and now the KING IN BLACK has come as the year reaches a close. For a year encompassed by a pandemic, Marvel Comics has delivered some remarkable stories by extraordinarily talented individuals. I would once again like to thank everyone involved from top to bottom for the hard work they put forth this year. It’s because of these outstanding individuals that many of us have been able to survive and find some sort of escape this year. I hope that Marvel Comics can continue on this path throughout 2021 and I can’t wait to see what’s next for so many of my favorite characters, writers, artists, and series. Once again, Amazon Links were attached above for you to snag all of these excellent comics. Thank you once again to everyone involved and Thank you all so much for the read and continued support.

Starting off the action is a matchup between last year’s Eastern Conference heavyweights — the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks — followed by a meeting between the Golden State Warriors and new-look Los Angeles Lakers.In preparation for the upcoming year, we at The Game Day took the liberty of ranking the top 100 players in the NBA. This was no easy list to compile given the vast amount of talent across the league, and do note that it is entirely subjective.Additionally, if you’re looking to place a few preseason player and team prop bets before the games are underway, you’ve come to the right place. Below, you’ll find some of our favorite picks mixed into the NBA Top 100 list, including a few major NBA award winners.With that said, let’s dive right in.Looking to bet on the NBA this season?

Although the high-scoring point guard isn’t the player he once was with the Charlotte Hornets, New York clearly upgraded at the position by bringing him in.A native of the Bronx, Walker will be welcomed with open arms by Knicks fans hoping to see their team make consecutive playoff appearances for the first time since 2013.If Walker proves to be a solid fit in Tom Thibodeau‘s system alongside Julius Randle and RJ Barrett, New York should have no issue returning to the postseason despite playing in a surprisingly crowded Eastern Conference.prop bet Bet $20, Payout $33Kemba Walker could experience a renaissance year with his hometown New York Knicks in 2021-22. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Toronto Raptors forward OG Anunoby is one of the most popular picks to win Most Improved Player in 2021-22, and it’s not hard to see why. The 24-year-old has made large strides in each of his first four NBA seasons, but he feels especially primed to have a breakout year.With Kyle Lowry out of the picture, someone on this Raptors team needs to step up and become the go-to guy. Pascal Siakam floundered when given the opportunity last year, and Fred VanVleet isn’t a No. 1 option.That leaves the up-and-coming Anunoby, a rock-solid two-way wing with an improved shooting touch and hunger for the spotlight. If he can lead the Raptors back to the playoffs in 2022 after a disappointing year in Tampa Bay, his name will be rightfully be at the forefront of the conversation.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $420A breakout season could be on the horizon for Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby. (Image: USA TODAY Sports)The Chicago Bulls are going to be a ton of fun this season. Zach LaVine‘s monstrous season wasn’t enough to carry them into the postseason in 2020-21, but with the help the franchise got him this offseason, Chicago may be a virtual shoo-in this year.In addition to acquiring Nikola Vučević at the trade deadline, the Bulls also added DeMar DeRozan and Lonzo Ball via free agency, building one of the more talented starting rotations in the NBA in the process.With that said, it should be known that this is still LaVine’s team. The high-flying guard averaged 27.4 points per game on near-50/40/90 splits in 2020-21, and the additions of DeRozan and Ball should lead to more open looks.Expect LaVine to lead the Bulls to their first postseason appearance since 2017 — and look for them to rack up plenty of wins along the way.over-under Bet $20, Payout $38The Chicago Bulls look like one of the most talented teams in the Eastern Conference on paper, but will it translate to success on the court? (Image: USA TODAY Sports)Kevin Durant put together one of the best seasons of his career in 2020-21, and that’s saying a lot considering the 33-year-old is a former MVP, 11x All-Star, and 4x Scoring Champion. Durant was as efficient as ever in his debut year with the Brooklyn Nets, pouring in 26.9 points per game and shooting a career-high 45% from three-point range.However, where the Slim Reaper really brought his A-game was in the playoffs, where he averaged an absurd 34.3 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 4.4 assists per game. He was at his best in Brooklyn’s Game 5 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, putting together a 49-point triple-double in one of the single-greatest playoff performances in NBA history.To put it simply, there’s no stopping KD. As long as he can stay healthy this year and keep his production up, there won’t be anybody standing in the way of him earning his second Most Valuable Player award.Player Prop Bet $20, Payout $160\n",

Betting Impact:Despite Villanova's dominance in this series, the Jayhawks are -4.5 point favorites, per BettingPros consensus odds. This point spread is slightly up from an initial opening of -4, and the movement may be due to the verification that Wildcats second-leading scorer, Justin Moore, will miss the game after suffering a torn Achilles against Houston. Villanova has covered the spread in all four NCAA Tournament games thus far, and are 21-6 ATS in its last 27 tournament games overall. Kansas is 6-2 ATS in its last eight games, but has covered just two of its last seven NCAA Tournament games. The underdog has covered the spread in four of the last five meetings between these teams. The Duke Blue Devils have been bet up from -4 to -4.5 point favorites for their Sweet 16 matchup against the North Carolina Tar Heels, per BettingPros consensus odds.\n",
      "Betting Impact:North Carolina is making its 21st Final Four appearance, the most all-time. While North Carolina extends its record for most Final Four appearances, Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski makes a record 13th Final Four appearance, passing John Wooden for the most all-time. Krzyzewski is also the tenth head coach to make a Final Four in his last season. The Blue Devils went 1-1 SU and ATS in two regular-season meetings against the Tar Heels. North Carolina has covered the spread in all four NCAA Tournament games, and Duke has covered its last three, which followed a span of seven consecutive NCAA Tournament games where it did not cover the spread. The over/under has much more volatility than the point spread, as some sportsbooks are as low as 150.5 points and as high as 151.5. The two regular-season meetings between Duke and North Carolina totaled 154 and 175 points, each cashing the over. The over is 5-2 in North Carolina’s last seven games as underdogs and 8-2 in Duke’s previous ten. The Duke-North Carolina game is likely to have the biggest handle of any college basketball game this season, and sportsbooks are likely expecting the majority of the betting public to back the Blue Devils. \n",
      "Leading up to Saturday's Final Four, the Duke Blue Devils have the best odds of all four teams to win the national championship. Betting Impact:Per DraftKings, each team's odds to win the national championship are as follows: Duke (+155), Kansas (+185), Villanova (+450), North Carolina (+500). The Blue Devils and Jayhawks have -195 and -180 ML odds, respectively, to win their Final Four matchups. If they do, it would set up a nostalgic rematch in Mike Krzyzewski's last game, as he beat Kansas in 1991 for his first-ever national championship. The Kansas Jayhawks have opened as -6 point favorites for their Elite Eight matchup against the Miami Hurricanes, with an O/U of 147.5 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Betting Impact:The Miami Hurricanes earned their first-ever Elite Eight appearance with a dominating 14-point victory over Iowa State. Combined with Saint Peter’s deep run, their win makes it ten of the past 11 NCAA Tournaments where at least one No. 7 seed or lower has reached the Elite Eight. Kansas’ Sweet 16 victory over Providence was also historic, as it was the Jayhawks’ 2,354th win, breaking a tie with Kentucky for the most wins in Division I. This is now Bill Self’s 11th career Elite Eight appearance and ninth as Jayhawks head coach. As the lone remaining No. 1 seed, Kansas kept the streak alive that at least one No. 1 seed has made the Elite Eight in every NCAA Tournament since seeding began in 1979. However, this is the first time fewer than two No. 1 seeds have made the Regional Finals since 2013. Kansas has been favored in all but one of its 38 games this season. The Jayhawks have failed to cover their last two games, which followed a streak of five consecutive covers. Miami has covered four straight games and six of its previous seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Saint Peter's Peacocks are the first-ever No. 15 seed to advance to the Elite Eight, and will look to continue making history as underdogs against the North Carolina Tar Heels. Betting Impact:The Tar Heels are -8 point favorites with an O/U of 137 points, per BettingPros consensus odds. Before this year's Peacocks team, the lowest seed ever to make an Elite Eight was a No. 12 seed (2002 Missouri, 2021 Oregon State). Conversely, the North Carolina Tar Heels are making their 27th Elite Eight appearance and first since 2017. North Carolina advanced to the Elite Eight with a 73-66 win over UCLA. The victory was UNC's 17th straight over Pac-12 teams. While not as improbable as Saint Peter's run, North Carolina had to win two of three tournament games as underdogs to be in this position. The Tar Heels improved to 10-4 SU all-time as a No. 8 seed and reached the Final Four as a No. 8 seed in 2000. Hubert Davis is now the fifth head coach to make an Elite Eight appearance in his first season as a D-I head coach, and first since Stan Heath in 2002. Saint Peter's entered the NCAA Tournament as the best ATS team of any in the 68-team field, and now three straight wins and covers have improved its ATS record to 23-9. At most sportsbooks, Saint Peter's was 10,000:1 to win the national championship before the tournament. The Peacocks are the only team to win multiple games as a double-digit underdog in an NCAA Tournament since the tournament expanded in 1985. From 1985-2021, double-digit favorites in the Sweet 16 went 35-2 SU but went 0-2 this year after Saint Peter's win over Purdue and Arkansas' win over Gonzaga. Saint Peter's outright win over Purdue as +13 point underdogs was the biggest Sweet 16 upset since 1978.If you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, please call 1-800-GAMBLER.All betting content on TheGameDay.com is exclusively intended for audience members 21 years and older who are permitted to gamble in legal states.

      "There are roughly a million ways to rank and order players in today’s analytically inclined NBA where stats and information can overwhelm those of us who don’t have a degree in quantum physics. Seriously, pick just about any stat or specific skill—like offensive rating, win shares, +/-, or shooting percentage on corner threes—and we can neatly order the 500-plus players who will be on an NBA roster this season into a coherent hierarchy.But when wading into a topic as arbitrary, and often inflammatory, as who are the NBA’s 50 best players, you often reach a state of chaos before ever approaching any sort of consensus. Which, honestly, is the way it should be when the rankings rely largely on the eye test mixed in with a few other factors.While it’s kind of an absurd proposition, of course, to accurately and definitively order basketball’s best players, it’s what we love to do. And we have the chutzpah to tell you that we do it better than anybody else out there. So we’re back, before the start of what we hope is a truly normal basketball season after two straight weird ones, to offer up our annual NBA player rankings.Exhaustively argued and astutely ordered, our readers know ranking the top 50 players in the NBA is a tradition here at Complex Sports. But before wading into this year’s version, you should know that we’ve anointed someone new as basketball’s best. Spoiler alert: the reign of LeBron James as the NBA’s unquestioned No. 1 baller has ended. While LeBron stans and Lakers fans may protest, we expect the majority of readers will not have any issues with our new No. 1. Nor will they have any issues with our top 5. Or probably the top 10. The controversies and complaints start once we get into the teens and we’re prepared to never hear the end of it for placing the forever polarizing Draymond Green on our list yet again.We think you’ll agree with how the majority of our rankings shook out, knowing, of course, that this exercise will forever be rooted in imperfect science. You’ll probably raise a few eyebrows or possibly even curse our name as you scroll through. We get it. We respect it. Just read the reasons why we moved Khris Middleton way up and left a few familiar names from previous seasons off before roasting us on Twitter, please.\n",

His progress in 2020-21 hasn't been as great, but he is also recovering from COVID-19. Few players possess Tatum's three-level scoring ability, and he has improved as a playmaker and a defender. The list of players you'd take before Tatum when starting a franchise is short.Team: LA ClippersPosition: ForwardAge: 30Previous ranking: n/a2020-21 stats: 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 49.9% FG, 45% 3FGWhere he stands right now: George had a rough showing in the NBA's bubble, but has come out with a vengeance this season. He is having his most efficient scoring season of his career while averaging a career-high in assists per game and playing his usual solid defense. The Clippers have destroyed opponents with George on the floor, outscoring them by 12 points per 100 possessions.Team: Miami HeatPosition: Guard/ForwardAge: 31Previous ranking: 112020-21 stats: 20.5 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 1.9 steals, 45.4% FG, 23.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Butler doesn't always fit the profile of an elite player because of his lack of shooting and occasional hesitancy to score. But just five other players this season are averaging 20-7-7 per game. Butler is averaging career-highs in rebounds and assists all while playing his usual stout defense, and the Heat are 14-8 with him in the lineup. Let's not forget that he's just a few months removed from a dominant postseason run where he went toe-to-toe with LeBron James in the Finals.\n",

Some consider him an MVP candidate. So why did his ranking fall? Doncic started the season slow, coming into training camp out of shape and struggling with efficiency. In the meantime, his Mavericks struggled out of the gate while Doncic faced critiques about complaining to refs and poor attitude. His play has ticked up lately, and his team has followed suit. Don't worry, Mavs fans: it feels like a matter of time until Doncic is a consensus top-three player.Team: Portland Trail BlazersPosition: GuardAge: 30Previous ranking: 102020-21 stats: 29.8 points, 4.3 rebounds, 8.0 assists, 44.5% FG, 38.4% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Lillard is showing his value this year, carrying a battered Blazers squad missing three projected starters. Lillard rises to the occasion like no one else in the NBA: he is second in points scored in the \"clutch\" — defined as the last five minutes of a game with the score within five points — with a ridiculous 63-58-100 shooting line. The Blazers are 14-5 in those situations.\n",

He's carrying a so-so Warriors roster to playoff contention all while scoring at near career-best levels. No player carries more gravity when he steps on the court, and Curry's unique ability to play off the ball supports the players around him.Team: Brooklyn NetsPosition: GuardAge: 312020-21 stats: 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 11.1 assists, 48.4% FG, 40% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Rejuvenated in Brooklyn, Harden has tweaked his game from all-encompassing offensive engine to, well, just playing point guard. The step-back threes and line-drives to the rim are still there, but Harden has also willingly dished the ball to teammates and selflessly advanced the ball on fastbreaks to drive the Nets offense. The Nets' plethora of offensive weapons makes it a bit harder to separate Harden's brilliance from circumstance, but he's nonetheless thriving with a change of scenery.Team: Los Angeles LakersPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 27Previous ranking: 42020-21 stats: 22.5 points, 8.4 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.9 blocks, 53.3% FG, 29.3% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Davis got off to a puzzling slow start to the season and has only played in two games since early February because of an Achilles issue. We're betting the slow start is an aberration and Davis will return to the floor ready to carry the Lakers in stretch run. Perhaps the best two-way player in the NBA, Davis combines elite rim protection with a varied offensive game that extends comfortably to the three-point line. At his best, he is a problem opponents can't solve.Team: Denver NuggetsPosition: CenterAge: 26Previous ranking: 72020-21 stats: 27.1 points, 11 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 56.7% FG, 41.8% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Jokic is on the periphery of two incredible statistical groups, and he's doing it at the same time: averaging a triple-double with a 50-40-90 shooting line. No one has ever done both. The stats are just a glimpse at one of the league's most dominant offensive players. Jokic is more aggressive than ever, willingly shooting threes, bullying opponents in the post, and even dunking. When he's not looking for his shot, he's whipping one-handed assists around the court and serving as the fulcrum of the Nuggets offense. Denver has under-performed this season, but not because of Jokic.\n",

The frontrunner for the MVP is in the best shape of his life, scoring more efficiently than ever, all while holding down the middle for the best team in the East. The question is if Embiid can carry it over a full season and into the playoffs, but he is currently prime Shaq with a more diverse offensive game.Team: Milwaukee BucksPosition: Forward/CenterAge: 26Previous ranking: 52020-21 stats: 29 points, 11.7 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 55.7% FG, 28.5% 3FGWhere he stands right now: Antetokounmpo and the Bucks haven't consistently found their groove this season. It says a lot that the two-time, reigning MVP's slow start has him putting up almost identical numbers to his last two seasons. Antetokounmpo's outside shot still evades him, but his defense hasn't taken a break and he has improved as a playmaker. Players like Embiid and Jokic are threatening to pass him,  but let's give it a full season before dropping Antetokounmpo.\n",

Last year's Clippers team fell well short of their goals, but they are once again dominant with Leonard on the floor this season. After a blazing-hot start to the season, Leonard's shooting has cooled off slightly. Expect Leonard to kick things up a notch in the stretch run and postseason.Team: Brooklyn NetsPosition: ForwardAge: 32Previous ranking: 22020-21 stats: 29 points, 7.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 52.4% FG, 43.4% 3FGWhere he stands right now: You wouldn't know Durant missed over a year of basketball recovering from a torn Achilles, one of the toughest injuries in basketball. The smooth jumper, quick first step, and ability to read the floor and turn it up on defense when needed are all still there. Durant had likely become the best overall player in the NBA from 2017-2019 before suffering his injury in the 2019 Finals. Health is still a big question, as he's played just 19 games this season, but when he's been on the floor, he's been as dominant as ever\n",

James is past the point at which he should still be an All-Star-caliber player, let alone an MVP-caliber player. He's lost a step physically, but is still a masterful chess player, arranging the court to his will to pick apart defenses. He led the league in assists last year for the first time in his career, at age 35. And when it comes to the postseason, his track record says it all — nine Finals appearances and four championships in 10 years.

Like in years past, voters were given a simple/painful task: Rank the best 25 players in the NBA today. Only this year, we limited the panel to our pool of regular analysts: Dan Devine, J. Kyle Mann, Rob Mahoney, and Kevin O’Connor. Resident stats wizard Zach Kram also chipped in “By the numbers” analysis for each player of the list, and a video debating the top spot will drop in the coming weeks. Without further ado, the results, based on average ranking, are as follows. (All stats through Sunday; all records through Monday.)Team: Timberwolves (20-45) | Position: Big 24.8 points, 10.9 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 1.3 blocks, 55.7 eFG%, -2.8 net rating, 43 GPJ. Kyle Mann: If we were simply asking “Who’s the best player on the planet?” I think KAT is low. He might be the best volume shooting center in the history of basketball, and although he’s diverged from the track that we expected for him initially, we shouldn’t let that distract us from the significance of that accolade. We’ve had 59 instances of a center posting a season with at least 200 3-point attempts, and Karl owns five of the top seven most efficient seasons, 2020-21 being one of them. Overall—nah, this isn’t exactly the mind-boggling prime output season that we might want from one of our foremost offensive frontcourt talents, but he’s still critical to Minnesota’s ... is “success” the word? We’ll call it “relative stability.” The Wolves are plus-9.9 points per 100 possessions with Towns on the court. This roster would be lost in the timber without him. We often think of Towns as a stiff-hipped pull-up shooter or a back-you-down-and-baby-hook-you post scorer (a.k.a. “The Kenny Payne Special”), but I don’t think KAT gets enough credit for the things he does in the spaces between, specifically his footwork when navigating traffic and getting to the rim. New coach Chris Finch has Towns operating away from the basket, which allows KAT to attack the basket and create more than ever, and is it possible that we’ve also underrated his creativity as a passer?Towns has been a productive kite in a hurricane for the past few seasons, but with the growth of Anthony Edwards, the thrilling surprise of Jaden McDaniels, and D’Angelo Russell’s early success playing next to KAT, the Wolves quietly seem like they’re a piece away from at least being interesting. By the numbers: There are just five seasons in NBA history in which a player averaged double-digit rebounds and at least 2.5 3-pointers per game. Two of them belong to Towns: last season and this season.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Guard17.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.7 steals, 56.9 eFG%, 9.2 net rating, 52 GPDan Devine: The price Milwaukee paid for Holiday—in terms of both the players and draft picks they sent to New Orleans during the offseason, and the nine-figure extension they gave him last month—was mighty steep. But it’s hard to argue that he hasn’t been worth the money thus far, given both how beautifully he’s fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton … and how brilliantly he performed without Giannis when the two-time MVP was out nursing a knee injury.With Giannis in and out of the lineup for a 13-game stretch starting on March 22, Holiday averaged 25.7 points, 8.2 assists, and 5.9 rebounds per 36 minutes of non-Giannis floor time. His usage spiked in those non-Giannis minutes, and his shooting exploded from “most efficient of his career” to “absolutely scorching.” It was a small sample born out of necessity, but when needed, he produced—a 27 percent usage rate, 34 percent assist rate, 65.4 true shooting—like one of the most devastating offensive forces in the league.We tend to think of Jrue as an all-world defender and complementary playmaker; we don’t think of him like that. Seeing it in action, though, made me appreciate why so many people have for so long described Holiday as the most underrated player in the league—and helped make it crystal clear why the Bucks both forked over a king’s ransom to get him and backed up the Brink’s truck to keep him.By the numbers: When Holiday was injured midseason, the Bucks lost five games in a row. With Holiday on the court, the Bucks haven’t lost more than two in a row all season.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Big19.1 points, 9.1 rebounds, 5.3 assists, 1.1 blocks, 57.0 eFG%, 1.1 net rating, 58 GPDevine: Time and again, guards work switches against Miami’s defense, drawing Adebayo out into deep water in isolation, thinking they’re going to torch him like they do to the plodding bigs plugging the middle elsewhere in the NBA. And time and again, they learn what Couper Moorhead of Heat.com calls “the Lesson”—that Bam ain’t those other plodding bigs, and that trying to attack him one-on-one isn’t a mismatch ... at least, not in the way that they thought.This is a very loud way for Devin Booker to learn #TheLesson. pic.twitter.com/pzdyWlM8IgAdebayo switches on screens more often than any other player in the league, and more than holds his own, even against the league’s best guards. Even while shouldering a larger-than-ever share of the offensive burden in Miami this season, Bam hasn’t lost the defensive tenacity and malleability that made the Heat fall in love with him coming out of Kentucky. If anything, he’s gotten even better on that end, cementing his reputation as one of the game’s most complete stoppers with every new lesson he teaches.By the numbers: After splitting time between power forward and center in the 2019-20 regular season, Adebayo moved fully to center for the Heat’s playoff run. He’s stayed there in 2020-21, spending 99 percent of his minutes at the 5, per Cleaning the Glass.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Guard26.4 points, 4.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.0 steals, 52.0 eFG%, 7.9 net rating, 53 GPRob Mahoney: There’s something a bit tragic about the defender who feels he’s done enough—after watching film, digesting the scouting report, and zeroing in with complete focus—only to find himself deep in a stance on the perimeter, waiting for Mitchell to make the first move. So much of what Mitchell creates begins this way, with the Jazz guard theoretically well covered by what are often bigger, longer defenders. Then the theory breaks. Mitchell stutter steps by or slams his defender into a screen. Maybe he just dribbles right past by attacking a half-beat earlier than expected. Where he distinguishes himself is through literal separation; high-level playoff defenses might challenge Mitchell to make split-second reads against layers of evolving coverage, but even those schemes operate under the assumption that the first layer is pretty much toast.Only four players in the league this season have scored more unassisted points than Mitchell, according to data from PBP Stats—notable not only for its sheer volume, but the contrast between that sort of iso scoring and the way Utah runs its offense more broadly. The Jazz sustain themselves through the patience of their ball movement, but in moments of desperation, they simplify their attack to beat the clock or minimize risk. It’s Mitchell who allows them to change gears as needed, merging the ideals of Utah’s system with the practicalities of an NBA game through the pressure he applies with a live dribble.By the numbers: Mitchell is the fourth Jazz player to reach 25 points per game in a season. The other three—Karl Malone, Adrian Dantley, and Pete Maravich—are all in the Hall of Fame.Team: Knicks (37-28) | Position: Big24.2 points, 10.3 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 0.3 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 3.7 net rating, 63 GPKevin O’Connor: An open mind has changed Randle’s career. After six seasons of mixed returns, Randle altered his tendencies in a way that has dramatically improved his game. No longer is he an unreliable defender who loses focus and lets his intensity waver. This season, Randle became one of the NBA’s most impactful and versatile defenders. He stays focused and hustles—habits that have even improved throughout the season. In the past, Randle was a black hole whenever he got an offensive touch. It disgusted fans whenever he’d barrel into a crowded paint instead of finding an open teammate. Now, he’s a playmaking hub for the Knicks, and he’s even becoming a go-to scorer because of his improved shot.Randle is now one of the best players in the NBA, and that’s all due to his mindset and the work he put in to find a new version of himself. There’s a lesson in there for all of us.By the numbers: Randle isn’t just scoring and shooting and passing better than ever before. He’s also played 113 minutes more than any other player—basically the equivalent of three extra games.Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Wing25.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.7 eFG%,7.6 net rating, 60 GPMahoney: There are scorers with a signature, and then there are scorers like Booker—comfortable in so many spaces and actions that it can be a challenge to decide how to even defend them. Booker can beat you by curling into midrange jumpers; he can exploit matchups by posting smaller guards; he can make longer wings chase him around screens, only to change directions and attack the basket once they catch up. Playing with Chris Paul helps him to leverage all of those threats in phases throughout the course of a game, but only because Booker’s breadth of ability is the skeleton key.There’s proof of that in the Suns’ minutes without Paul, when Booker runs even more pick-and-roll and keeps the offense absolutely sizzling. It doesn’t really matter whether he’s surrounded by starters or reserves; there’s always a way for Booker to get going, to improvise a bucket through relentless creativity. As a genuine three-level scorer, his power comes from possession. Defenders don’t have much choice but to take every hesitation and shot fake seriously. The next one could be the pull-up that puts the game away.By the numbers: Booker is one of eight players in NBA history with 9,000 career points through their age-24 season. The others? LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady, Anthony Davis, and Shaquille O’Neal.Team: Wizards (30-35) | Position: Guard31.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1.2 steals, 53.1 eFG%, -1.1 net rating, 55 GPMann: Some time ago my wife and I went to a Mexican restaurant on a random weeknight to snag a bite, and we (luckily) wandered into what appeared to be the saddest karaoke night of all time. At one point a middle-aged guy resembling George R.R. Martin got up, quietly ambled across the brightly colored room to hand his CD to the DJ, and waited silently on stage for his instrumental cue. The track was immediately recognizable. It was “Everybody Wants to Rule the World.” I was elated, because I expected something epically terrible and wildly entertaining. Joke was on me—it was amazing. He was obviously technically gifted, but this guy also fucking performed. The thing that really struck me, aside from his brilliance, was that his dazzling talent seemed totally out of place in this ordinary restaurant that barely clapped when he was finished. I feel like that sometimes when I’m watching Bradley Beal. I’m not saying Wizards fans don’t appreciate Beal—they adore him—and the second half of April has been fun for them, whipping up on some of the younger teams. It’s just that there are nights on League Pass when I see Beal, now hitting his absolute prime at 27 years old, on a team that’s 30-35, and think, we’ve got to get this guy in an environment where meaningful basketball is being played. To quote Colin Powell: A prime is a terrible thing to waste. OK, he didn’t actually say that, but the point stands. Beal’s 31.0 PPG (on 59.4 percent TS)—second behind Steph Curry in scoring—and his 3.3 BPM is a career high. It’s important to fully digest how dynamic Beal is. This is not a guy who you just run a weak-side pindown for or have him stand on the wing and hope he’s hitting shots off the catch. He can kill you that way, but Beal’s off-the-bounce footwork and economy of movement are among the best in the league. He’s deceptively fast on his first and second steps, and his head-and-shoulder hesitation bag is deep and lethal. He’s like a chess player who knows how many moves it’ll take to bring you down, and he refuses to stray from that design.Beal has also blossomed into a productive pick-and-roll scorer (.984 PPP, 79th percentile, per Synergy) in the decline and subsequent departure of John Wall. His reps in that area have surged in the past two seasons, and he’s been particularly productive in high ball screens, where he’s one of the most efficient players in the league at attacking the basket and getting to the line consistently. The Wizards fans I know seem content: They’ve enjoyed this guy, but moving on is understandable at this point. He’s a special prize who, if they move him, will hopefully yield a special return. By the numbers: Beal is the 12th player in NBA history to score 30-plus points per game in consecutive seasons. The first 11 comprise 10 Hall of Famers and James Harden.Team: Jazz (47-18) | Position: Big14.4 points, 13.4 rebounds, 1.3 assists, 2.8 blocks, 67.9 eFG%, 15.4 net rating, 64 GPO’Connor: When you think about Gobert, what’s the first thing that pops into your mind? For some people, it’s Curry putting him in the spin cycle. Or maybe more recently, it’s him leaving D’Angelo Russell wide open to win a game. These lowlights go viral, while his moments of brilliance so rarely get noticed. Gobert induces fear into opponents when he’s lurking around the rim. The Jazz allow only 0.85 points per pick-and-roll when Gobert is defending the screen, which Second Spectrum says is the league’s highest mark of players to log at least 400 plays. It’s his presence that makes Utah third best in defensive rating this season.On offense, the threat of him flushing an alley-oop causes defenses to collapse into the paint and free up shooters. He might not shoot 3s, but he’s the reason teammates are able to get so many wide-open looks from behind the arc. The focus is often on what Gobert doesn’t do instead of what he does, which is unfortunate. But Gobert will keep on producing, even if no one is noticing.By the numbers: On shots within 6 feet of the basket, opposing players are shooting 14 percentage points worse than expected with Gobert as the closest defender, per NBA.com—the greatest differential for any player who’s defended at least 250 shots.Team: Celtics (34-31) | Position: Wing26.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.1 steals, 53.1 eFG%, 2.9 net rating, 58 GPMahoney: What a strange season it’s been for Tatum, who tested positive for COVID back in January, returned to one of the most turbulent Celtics seasons in recent memory, and then moved his game forward while managing lingering, long-haul symptoms. Just a few weeks ago, Tatum revealed that he’s been using an inhaler before games to help with his breathing. You wouldn’t know he needed it by the way he’s cutting, posting, and breaking down defenders—especially as his production hit season-high marks in April. As always, it’s the balance that impresses most. Tatum is the kind of star who keeps every option open, allowing teammates to be their best selves and Celtics coach Brad Stevens to troubleshoot as needed. If it’s easiest for Tatum to go to work from the midpost or top of the arc, he can—but his game is no less effective if he’s moved around the floor, across positions, or between defensive matchups. Any two-way player of Tatum’s size is an incredible strategic luxury, but his technical prowess has made him indispensable. The only reason Boston’s season feels underwhelming is because Tatum is good enough to raise expectations.By the numbers: Tatum has more than doubled his assist rate from two seasons ago, from 10 percent of teammates’ baskets to 21 this season.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard26.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.3 steals, 56.4 eFG%, 5.4 net rating, 48 GPMann: Irving’s enigmatic existence as a hoops star is bizarre and somewhat unprecedented, to the point that it’s difficult to have a conversation purely about him as a basketball player. But the fact remains that Irving is still one of the most impactful offensive players on the planet. His multifaceted scoring—driven by his command of misdirection and his ability to decelerate hard in the middle portion of the floor—makes him extremely difficult to cover on an island, in open space. With heavy-load scorers next to him, his versatility is especially hard to take away. It’s been typical volume and typical efficiency from Irving, but he’s as active as ever getting downhill. He’s scored more points in the paint than ever before, and among jump shooters who’ve put up 400-plus attempts, Irving is seventh in the league in field goal percentage. He’s also fifth in isolation points per chance at 1.138. What Brooklyn as a whole has done this season is equally bizarre and unprecedented—not since Wynton Marsalis and Willie Nelson teamed up (just go with it) have we had megastars come together on a big stage with virtually no rehearsal time, but that’s what KD, Kyrie, and the Beard are doing. This trio has played a whopping 186 minutes together in only seven games, and yet the Nets are second in the East at 43-22, and Irving is the most consistent producer throughout that time. It speaks to the talent and experience of these three stars that the general assumption is that they’ll still be extremely difficult to stop from reaching the Finals.By the numbers: Evidence of the lethality of Irving’s shooting: He’s at 38.1 percent from 3 this season, which is comfortably above average in the NBA … yet his worst 3-point percentage in half a decade.Team: Heat (35-30) | Position: Wing21.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.1 steals, 50.7 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 48 GPDevine: Jimmy entered the bubble last summer as a five-time All-Star widely regarded as one of the finest two-way players in the sport. Inside, he became something more, fully embracing the odd-as-hell circumstances, fueling Miami’s thrilling run to the Finals, and authoring a pair of unforgettable performances against the Lakers before bowing out. The Heat, on the whole, have struggled in fits and starts this season to try to recapture the magic they found in Disney World.Butler, though? He’s been playing like he never left:Injury, illness, and inconsistency have left holes all over the Heat’s roster this season. Butler has stretched his game to try to fill them, scoring and facilitating efficiently in a larger offensive role while continuing to act as an All-Defensive Team–caliber stopper on opponents’ top options. I’m not sure the Heat will find enough answers by the play-in games to replicate last season’s run. I am sure, though, that I would want nothing to do with a win-or-go-home game against Jimmy, who showed in the bubble he’s good enough to be the best player on any floor he steps on, and who’s spent this season proving that wasn’t a fluke.By the numbers: Butler is shooting just 20.4 percent on 3-pointers, yet he’s still averaging 21.5 points per game. That’s the worst long-range accuracy for any of the 30 qualified players this season averaging at least 20 points. Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing23.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 steals, 56.0 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 49 GPMahoney: As a public figure, George can be rather bumbling—tripping through odd sound bites, needless excuses, and one inexplicable beef after another. As a player, he’s just smooth as hell. The second act of George’s career began when he really cleaned up his handle, and ever since, he’s shown how easy scoring 20 points a night can be. This is his most efficient season yet. Whether he’s handling the ball or angling to get open, George moves at a glide, slinking around defenders and through traffic. His game is just smooth enough to be occasionally frustrating. If you can get anywhere you want on the floor, why not get to the rim? It’s an easy criticism, and given the way George produces and defends, a largely irrelevant one. Plus, if your jumper looked this good, you might just fall in love with it, too.The truth is that George does so much more to paper over the Clippers’ limitations than he’s given credit for, starting with the way he’s shared playmaking duties for one of the highest-achieving offenses in the league. His all-around game gives a weird, somewhat flawed roster the credentials of a serious contender.By the numbers: Out of 28 players this season attempting at least seven 3-pointers per game, Steph Curry is naturally first in accuracy. George is second.Team: Pelicans (29-36) | Position: Point Big27.0 points, 7.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists, 0.6 blocks, 62.1 eFG%, 1.8 net rating, 59 GPO’Connor: What a privilege it is to watch this man hoop. Only 20 years old and averaging a Shaq-like stat line of 27 points on 62 percent from the field. He’s a dominant force who keeps getting better. This season, we’ve seen Zion morph into a playmaker who brings the ball up the court and runs pick-and-roll. Amazingly, he still has so much untapped upside to be unleashed—as long as he continues to develop his ball handling and jumper, and the pieces around him improve.By the numbers: Williamson is taking 13.3 shots per game in the restricted area. That’s 2.2 more attempts than anyone else in any season in the play-by-play era (dating back to 1996-97).Team: Suns (46-18) | Position: Guard16.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.4 steals, 55.2 eFG%, 6.5 net rating, 63 GPDevine: The bubble gave us our first indicator that Phoenix would be good. The second, more telling one, though, was that Chris Paul wanted to go there.CP3 doesn’t waste time. He’s here to optimize every second, whether it’s walking the dog to try to preserve possessions late in the game, or dramatically changing his diet to try to recover the step he seemed to be losing as he aged. He proved in a surprising All-NBA turn in Oklahoma City last season that he remains a Chopped grand champion, still capable of taking whatever’s in the cupboard and elevating it, and he looked at a Phoenix roster that already featured Devin Booker, Deandre Ayton, and Mikal Bridges and said, “Yeah, I can work with this.”And work he has, turning in one of the most productive seasons ever by a guard on the wrong side of 35 while serving as the straw that stirs the drink for a dynamite team that has blown away even the most optimistic preseason expectations. Booker’s the headliner, but the Suns operate like a classic CP3 team: slow-paced and careful with the ball, elite in the half court, disciplined on defense, excellent in crunch time. He augments both Phoenix’s poise and its snarl.Bringing in Paul to replace Ricky Rubio promised to raise Phoenix’s floor. But Paul continuing to play at this level also vaults the Suns’ ceiling, all the way up to the rarefied air reserved for title contenders.By the numbers: Paul is taking 63 percent of his shots from the midrange, per Cleaning the Glass—tied for the largest portion in the league. And he’s making 53 percent of them, which ranks in the 95th percentile.Team: Trail Blazers (36-29) | Position: Guard28.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 0.9 steals, 53.6 eFG%, 3.1 net rating, 59 GPMahoney: Forgive me for belaboring the Dame Time of it all, but how is it even possible that a 6-foot-2 guard could be so good in the highest-leverage situations as to completely bail out an otherwise one-sided team? The break-even Blazers are one of the NBA’s best outfits in the clutch, owed mostly to Lillard’s daring and shot-making with the game on the line. We really can’t overstate the value of that—especially when Lillard’s late-game performance could be the difference between Portland finishing the season as a play-in team and disastrously sliding out of the picture entirely. The one shot, game on the line conversation can be a bit reductive, but it’s also revealing to see how opponents react to that premise. Lillard can push a playoff-level team to full-on crisis. Panic switches, flailing miscommunications, out-of-character traps—anything and everything is possible when Dame has the ball in his hands late in a close game, and the Blazers rightly trust him not just to hit shots, but to make the best possible decisions. In that capacity, Lillard delivers for the full 48. He manages the game, he investigates the coverage, and when the bell finally tolls, he rips out an opponent’s still-beating heart. By the numbers: Lillard has scored 149 points in clutch situations this season, per NBA.com. That’s 20 more than anyone else.Team: Mavericks (36-28) | Position: Guard28.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 1.0 steals, 55.6 eFG%, 3.8 net rating, 58 GPO’Connor: Luka placed fourth in MVP voting in 2020 at age 20, in only his second season. It was the greatest sophomore season anyone has ever had, except arguably LeBron when he averaged 27-7-7 in 2004-05. LeBron placed sixth in MVP voting that season and wouldn’t win his first until 2009. Luka won’t win his first in the 2020-21 season, but he belongs in the top-five conversation again because he’s even better than he was last season. He’s better at shooting. He’s better at defense. He’s better at leading a team through adversity. He has carried the Mavericks through Kristaps Porzingis’s absences, a constantly changing rotation due to injuries, and the second-most games missed due to the COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Dallas is competing for a top-six seed in the playoffs largely because of another leap by Luka.By the numbers: Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are the only players in NBA history with multiple All-NBA appearances through their age-21 seasons. Doncic will join them this season.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: Big21.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.8 blocks, 52.6 eFG%, 4.6 net rating, 29 GPMann: It’s true that Davis has barely played this season. He missed 30 games starting in mid-February, but he’s still in the conversation for most versatile, utterly dominant two-way frontcourt player in the world. I actually had him ranked much higher.Offensively, it’s been an unremarkable season by Brow’s standards: He’s less active at the rim and he’s leaned heavily on his face-up game. Maybe that’s to avoid risk of injury, but I think that’s eaten into his overall efficiency.Defensively, he’s still a force. AD’s recovery speed, positional intelligence, and general disruptiveness make him one of the most impactful and skilled defenders in the NBA. At full health and fully humming, I don’t think there’s anyone better. It’s a simple calculus: He gives a ton and takes a ton away. Last season, among defenders who logged at least 1,000 possessions guarding screens, Davis had the lowest points per chance allowed in the league at .877. He was only put in position to defend screens 20.04 times per 100 possessions, the second-lowest amount among that sample. In other words, it was a fool’s errand to go at him.His incredible catch radius on the offensive end also allows him to bother or stifle passing activity in and around the paint, and everybody in the league knows it. Driving in Davis’s general direction is enough to create indecision or hesitation. Back in the mid-2000s, Bravo ran a special about the scariest movie moments. In it, panelists described what made watching Jaws so terrifying—after encountering that terror, you were never swimming in open water with a clear mind again. That’s what it’s like to attempt to create offense around Anthony Davis. He lingers in the back of your mind.His efficiencies in this area are down from last season, but the glimpses indicate that he’s still got the ability to flip the switch on in the playoffs. Watch Doncic punt on challenging him initially on this drive, kick it to Kleber, who fakes and drives at Davis and also decides not to attack him. Davis basically makes this a no-fly zone, challenging this skip pass to Luka to the point where its float time allows him to recover and heavily contest the shot. He’s a monster.By the numbers: Davis is struggling with his 3-point percentage in a small sample—but he’s converting at a career-best clip from both the restricted area and the midrange.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Guard25.4 points, 8.7 rebounds, 11 assists, 1.3 steals, 54.5 eFG%, 2.7 net rating, 34 GPDevine: “I don’t know, man. It’s been, like, three years of almost nothing but isolation. Can Harden even play regular basketball anymore?”As it turns out: yep.“All right, sure, he can run actual plays and stuff, and he’s willing to cut his usage damn near in half when he plays with KD and Kyrie. But what about when they’re not on the floor? Is he going to be able to carry this team like he did in Houston?”Again: yep.“Wait: So when he’s flanked by Hall of Famers, he lays back and runs the offense like Magic, and when he’s not, he snaps right back to being a do-everything MVP type?”Mm-hmm.“... Shit, that’s pretty impressive.”Yep!By the numbers: Harden leads the league in isolation possessions since moving to Brooklyn, but he’s averaging only eight isos per game—about half of his average in his last two full seasons in Houston. He also ranks in the 86th percentile in isolation efficiency.Team: Bucks (40-24) | Position: Big28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, 59.9 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 54 GPMahoney: Tempting as it may be to think of offense and defense as discrete from one another, every push in transition blurs the line between them. Giannis absolutely dominates these sorts of gray areas. If a smaller opponent has to pick him up in transition, he dunks. If a like-sized defender sprints in his path but meets Giannis too late, he dunks. If the Bucks set a drag screen for Giannis and the defense is forced to switch, he dunks. Overreact in his direction at any time, and a knock-down shooter will get target practice from beyond the arc. You can apply this same sort of no-win logic to many of the game’s in-between spaces, or any scenario that would force a less-than-optimal defender to contend with a titan.His size just makes it too easy for Milwaukee to turn the smallest momentary advantage into the highest-efficiency shots. Quality playoff teams try to minimize those vulnerabilities as best they can, but there’s only so much that can be done to stay out of defensive rotation, where Antetokounmpo can step over smaller guards and create opportunities from offensive rebounds. Any hope that opponents have of creating their own easy points in transition runs into the same massive problem: the reigning Defensive Player of the Year with the same size advantage, ready to meet them at the rim and ruin their day. Chaos is an inescapable part of the NBA game. Giannis has managed to make it his own.By the numbers: Across his two MVP seasons, Giannis averaged 28.5 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.1 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. This season, he’s averaging 28.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.3 blocks, and 1.2 steals per game on 63 percent true shooting. He’s the same player, with nearly the exact same stat line, as when he won back-to-back MVPs.Team: Clippers (43-22) | Position: Wing25.5 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.6 steals, 57.1 eFG%, 11.5 net rating, 47 GPO’Connor: We so often praise Kawhi for his defensive brilliance and his go-to scoring greatness. But he’s also improved over the years as a playmaker. This season, he’s averaging a career-high 5.1 assists and using the pick-and-roll to destroy defenses. Through May 1, 114 players have logged at least 400 possessions as a pick-and-roll ball handler and Leonard ranks first, leading the Clippers to score 1.12 points per chance, according to Second Spectrum. Leonard is still a score-first player, but adding a new dimension to his game has made him deadlier than ever.By the numbers: Leonard is averaging 2.6 assists per turnover this season. The best prior ratio of his career was 1.9.Team: Nets (43-22) | Position: Big28.1 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.2 blocks, 62.4 eFG%, 10.5 net rating, 28 GPMann: The buildup to the 2020-21 season was colored by the anxiety of whether or not Durant would be the Slim Reaper whom we’ve watched in awe for the past decade. His season has lacked rhythm in most every sense, but his return to the court has been wildly satisfying, as he’s proved that he’s still one of the world’s most elite shot-makers. He’s been especially efficient in isolation and shooting off the catch, and his effectiveness as an off-the-dribble shooter shows very little sign of having fallen off. Among players attempting at least 100 pull-up jumpers, Durant’s second in the NBA in effective field goal percentage, per Second Spectrum.If the Nets stay healthy and ramp this thing up, they are a gravitational nightmare for opponents. That’s especially nauseating for defenses when you consider that Durant has stared the biggest moments in the sport in the face and coolly plunged the dagger.By the numbers: The last time Durant was healthy, in 2018-19, he had the second-best offensive rating for a team that set a league record for offensive efficiency. This season, Durant is doing one better, with the best offensive rating for a team on pace to set a league record for efficiency.Team: Warriors (33-32) | Position: Guard31.3 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.2 steals, 60.9 eFG%, 3.2 net rating, 56 GPO’Connor: Despite having the worst supporting cast since Golden State’s run began, Steph is producing comparably to his unanimous MVP season in 2015-16. We are entering a turning point of Curry’s career. An identity crisis looms for the Warriors; James Wiseman has struggled as a rookie, Draymond Green lost his jumper, and Klay Thompson’s future is uncertain following two straight missed seasons. Steph is 33, and the competition in the West is steeper than it’s been … maybe ever. But Curry has proved to still be one of the few talents who can single-handedly lead his team to the playoffs. With a little more help, the Warriors could soon be back in the championship conversation.By the numbers: Among all player-seasons in NBA history with at least a 30 percent usage rate and 1,000 minutes played, the three best true shooting percentages are, in order: Curry in 2018, Curry in 2016, and now Curry in 2021.Team: 76ers (44-21) | Position: Big29.3 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 1.4 blocks, 54.5 eFG%, 11.3 net rating, 45 GPMahoney: The biggest revolution in Embiid’s game this season was a pivot. As a back-to-the-basket player, the Sixers center was a clear All-Star; as a face-up post player, he might be the most dominant player in the sport. Reorienting his game has allowed Embiid to do more of the heavy manufacturing necessary to really sustain an offense. His usage is up, far ahead of any other center. His scoring is up. His free throw attempts are up. And so long as he continues to hit midrange shots at a 47 percent clip, there’s not really a damn thing a defense can do to stop him. It’s so much harder to pressure Embiid when he’s already positioned to see double teams coming. There’s no blind side left to exploit; any attempt to force the ball out of Embiid’s hands is an invitation for a quick pass out to a wide-open 3-pointer, or a sales opportunity for Embiid to flail through his crowding defenders for yet another trip to the foul line.Yet doubling Embiid might still be the right call—if only because there are so few defenders big enough to get a hand in his face and mobile enough to keep up with his footwork. We know Embiid has entered a rare class because the only options to try to contain him are bad ones. Playing against the Sixers these days just means learning to live with his dominance. By the numbers: Embiid is averaging 12.7 free throw attempts per 36 minutes—breaking a league record held by Wilt Chamberlain since 1961-62, when he tallied 12.6 attempts per 36.Team: Lakers (37-28) | Position: LeBron25.0 points, 7.9 rebounds, 7.8 assists, 0.6 blocks, 57.8 eFG%, 9.4 net rating, 43 GPMann: I’ve had a fun time fleshing out this list, but I cannot in good conscience allow you people to walk away from any list where LeBron is not no. 1. And listen—I adore Nikola Jokic. I think he’s the most talented offensive center to walk the earth. At the same time, I’m trying to savor these last chances I have to appreciate LeBron, one of the truly great sports brands of all time. Unless you’re a bitter fan or you love these back-and-forth “ringz culture” pissing matches, you should do the same! Rally all of your thoughts behind this American icon!  LeBron is Brad Pitt smiling over the steering wheel in slo-mo in Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood. LeBron is Coke using Helvetica in a full-page ad.LeBron is one of the surest, most foundational things that we have. Don’t you crave stability and normalcy? What the hell are we doing, doubting him? After the year we’ve had, LeBron winning another title would be like the totem at the end of Inception falling to the table, revealing that we’re back from whatever awful nightmare that just was.All that aside: At 36 years old, it remains incredible that he’s able to uphold the scale of his impact while moving less than ever. It’s hard to blame him. LeBron is hunting rarified accolades, and at this stage of his career, with this many miles on the tires, he has to prioritize staying in the race until the end over sprinting to be clearly ahead at the third stage. He’s the baddest man alive until further notice.By the numbers: When LeBron plays (not counting the game he was hurt early), the Lakers have 14 losses versus 28 wins. When LeBron doesn’t play (or is hurt early), the Lakers also have 14 losses—but with only eight wins.Team: Nuggets (43-22) | Position: Point Big26.2 points, 10.9 rebounds, 8.5 assists, 0.7 blocks, 60.6 eFG%, 7.6 net rating, 64 GPDevine: Ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in space:That’s a tidy visualization of the degree to which Jokic has separated himself from all other players this season in a slew of advanced metrics—including estimated plus-minus, value over replacement player, box plus-minus, win shares, and FiveThirtyEight’s wins above replacement—to make the most difficult leap in the sport: from All-Star to MVP favorite.The 26-year-old has used Denver’s invigorating run in the bubble as a springboard, coming off his curtailed offseason in the best shape of his career and translating that into one of the most impressive offensive campaigns in NBA history. That’s not hyperbole: Jokic has married scoring efficiency, playmaking volume, and sheer offensive workload to a level that only Magic Johnson, LeBron James, and James Harden have ever reached. This is where I remind you that we are talking about a 6-foot-11, 284-pound center, one I compared three months ago—lovingly and favorably!—to a Mack truck.This year’s model of Jokic is a basketball futurist’s fever dream realized—the myth of the next Dirk Nowitzki and Arvydas Sabonis made manifest in one peerless package. Whether he can carry a wounded Nuggets team through a Western Conference littered with the kind of big-wing playmakers who have come to dominate postseason play remains to be seen; if my life depended on winning one game, I can’t swear he’d be my first pick. If I got him, though, I wouldn’t hate my chances. Because nobody—nobody—has played basketball better this season than Nikola Jokic.By the numbers: Combining points, assists, and screen assists, Jokic has created 58 points per game this season—a whopping five ahead of second place. The only other players above 50 are Harden (53), Doncic (52), Domantas Sabonis (51), Russell Westbrook (51), and Giannis (51). An SB Nation affiliate siteRanking The Top 20 NBA Players 2021The 2020-2021 NBA regular season has concluded and has given us the opportunity to re-rank the top 20 NBA players. Some of the criteria we will be using are skills, performances, and impact on winning. For this list, I will try to rank them as if healthy, for the most part. Previous lists usually took availability more into consideration. That may be why you will find many different rankings from my previous top NBA players list from March.Devin Booker is one of the most gifted scorers in the NBA. He started the year as the third best shooting guard on my list, and is arguably second best. I’m of the belief that Booker still has a long way to go in his development. The addition of Paul has enabled Booker to be more efficient, which was much needed. I believe Booker has “dominant” type skillset, but has yet to really be able to show that in a winning situation. In summary, teams do not fear Booker the way they should just yet.Although I was not a fan of Beal’s attitude to start the year, he eventually bought into Westbrook’s leadership and the Wizards benefited as a result of it. Beal is one of the most capable scorers in the NBA. He could be higher on this list if he made his teammates better or played defense. The Wizards have a long way to go, and so does Beal.Per Sources followers may accuse me of being biased for ranking Tatum above Beal. However, I’ll make it very simple for you to understand. The playin tournament said it all for me. Tatum is improving as an offensive threat and has earned the respect of almost every NBA defender. His ability to score is right up there with the elites. Unlike Beal and Booker, I have seen Tatum do it in meaningful games, repeatedly. In addition to that, Jayson Tatum plays defense. Defense still matters folks.Some NBA fans rank Tatum as a top 10 player. I am not there yet.Yes, I have Simmons over Tatum, for now. Simmons is a top 2 DPOY candidate, and the star point guard of the no.1 ranked team in the Eastern Conference.  He makes his teammates better and does a lot at an elite level.Unfortunately, his inability to shoot is what’s keeping him from climbing on this list.As many of you already know, I am not a fan of Kyrie Irving. In fact, I have expressed numerous times why I and many others dislike Kyrie Irving. However, there is no denying Irving’s skillset and impact on winning, when playing alongside other stars. He is one of the best complimentary pieces to elite talent that you can find in the NBA.When available, Irving has proven he can help a team win when playing alongside two other all-stars. Irving is showing that once again.What more can Chris Paul do to prove to us that he is still an elite point guard in the NBA? Chris Paul is one of the best regular season players in NBA history. He makes any team he joins better. My only knock on Paul remains the fact that I have not seen him impact winning when his teams need him most. I don’t expect this year to be any different.For what he does, he does really well. He is still very impressive at 36 years of age.There are very few players that impact winning and make their teammates better the way Jimmy Butler does. The Heat were one of the best passing teams in the NBA this season, and would have finished with a better record had Butler not missed time. Butler is one of the toughest two way players in the NBA.I have my suspicions as to why the Heat struggled in the playoffs this year. Butler is not to blame for that, in my opinion.There are very few players who can actually impact the culture of an organization. The Wizards have almost become too content with missing the playoffs. They even started this season with wanting to give up at several points. Nonetheless, Westbrook never gave up.Westbrook was willing to do it all to lift the Wizards to the 8th seed. By any means necessary, the Wizards made it, despite having a mediocre and relatively injured roster. Westbrook is truly one of the most underappreciated superstars in NBA history.George remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. Say what you want about his lack of playoff success, there is no denying George’s talent and physical gifts. My only issue with George is his mental toughness. He reminds me a lot of Vince Carter.In my heart, I still believe that Leonard is the second best player in the NBA. I just couldn’t rank him in my top 10 NBA players at this point. All the things I respected about Leonard haven’t been present ever since he joined the Clippers. In the past, I watched LeBron James shut down the Bulls’ offense when guarding Derrick Rose in the playoffs. Last night, Leonard failed to instill any fear in the heart of Doncic and the Mavericks.Something has changed for the worse, and I can’t pin point what it is exactly. Leonard is still the closest thing I have seen to Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, but I need some reconvincing right now.What Anthony Davis can do, when healthy, is almost unmatched. He remains one of the best two way players in the NBA. I know I mentioned in the opening paragraph that I would weigh availability a little less than I usually do, but I just can’t do that with Davis. He may be the reason the Lakers are about to be eliminated tonight. Davis needs to figure out a way to be available. Despite his health issues, I couldn’t leave a talent like Davis off the top 10 of my top 20 NBA players in 2021.I’m of the belief that Lillard is asked to do too much, which causes him to burn out come playoff time. That is why I lack faith in Lillard and the Trail Blazers come playoff time. However, there is no denying that Lillard is a superstar talent. Not only is he an elite scoring point guard, he is arguably the most clutch player in the NBA. When I think of Lillard, I don’t think of dominant like Leonard. However, the continuity he has with Terry Stotts has enabled Lillard to perform at a very high level in the regular season. The guys ahead of Lillard on my top 20 NBA players 2021 list, I consider dominant.Joel Embiid is right up there with Anthony Davis as one of the best two way big men in the NBA. Embiid’s dominance enabled him to be an MVP favorite for a large chunk of the season. However, like Davis, injuries have plagued him throughout his career. If the 76ers are going to win an NBA championship this season, they’re going to need a healthy Embiid to be at his best.Embiid has the talent to do it. The question is, is he built to last?MVP.Ranking Doncic ahead of Jokic on my top 10 NBA players list was a very difficult decision for me. They both make their teams better, dominate at a high level, and have incredibly high basketball IQs. Jokic is a slightly better defender.  However, it is very easy to argue that Doncic is doing a lot more, with a lot less talent. Doncic used the early portion of the regular season to get himself in shape, which cost the Mavericks in the rankings. Now that he is in shape, he is almost impossible to stop. I watched Doncic single handedly torch the Los Angeles Clippers last night.Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Tim Dunca, LeBron James, and now Luka Doncic. I consider this kid a once in a generation type talent. I haven’t been wrong about Doncic yet. If I’m wrong right now, it may be the fact that I’m not ranking him as the best player in the world yet.For a decent amount of this season, Harden was playing like the best player in basketball. Now that he is healthy again, he is looking like the best player in the world once again. Sometimes opportunity can shape up a large part of your success. Harden may be a beneficiary of his current opportunity with the loaded Brooklyn Nets.Harden also happens to be the most lethal isolation offensive threat I’ve ever seen in my life. Whether it’s the step back three, attacking the rim, or passing, Harden can do it all. I just wonder what he and the Nets will look like playing against another top tier eastern conference team. There is no denying the 2x MVP & DPOY’s talent. Perhaps no player impacts both sides of the court like Antetokounmpo does. I also love the fact that he is continuing to improve, year after year. Antetokounmpo’s poise may help the Bucks win in this post season. Fans may argue his limitations as a shooter. I believe this series vs the Brooklyn Nets will be a massive indicator as to just how much does shooting matter to a star in the NBA.LeBron James publicly considered Curry as the MVP for good reason. Curry proved once again that he can torch any team, on any given night. He is the best shooter in NBA history. His handles are on par with Irving and his passing is on par with Nash. He is one of the most gifted point guards in NBA history, currently ranked 2nd all time on my list.If Klay was healthy, the Warriors would be my favorites to win the NBA championship this season. Ranking Durant this highly is complicated and slightly contradictory. If I was building a team for the regular season, I can argue that there are 20+ players I’d take over Kevin Durant. If it weren’t for a mid season trade, I don’t know if Brooklyn would have even made the playoffs this season due to his and Irving’s absences. However, I’m looking at Durant as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Durant is one of the most gifted, if not the most gifted, scorer in NBA history. There is no proven method of guarding Durant. I don’t know if there is a proven way of even slowing him down. When available, good luck finding a scorer better than Durant. As of right now, he is available, and dominant.LeBron James is still the king in my eyes. He makes his teammates better in ways no one else can in the NBA. I don’t think people realize how bad the Lakers roster actually is. They have taken a significant step back from last season’s team, and I didn’t even think that roster was that good.At 36, the king remains dominant. However, for the first time in Per Sources history, I feel like the end of James’ dominance is near. It’s shaky. I can sense it.  I hope when the time comes, I’m ready to admit it.I have to mention Klay Thompson, who is out due to injury. Two players I feel the need to mention are Rudy Gobert and Trae Young. Both have impact on winning that I do not feel like NBA fans appreciate. I’d also like to recognize the improving talents of DeAndre Ayton, Ja Morant, and Zion Williamson.Jaylen Brown and Julius Randle are also two players that could make this list next season.

      "Top 100 NBA players for 2021-22 seasonJoel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Sixers, top 100 NBA players (Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)(Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images)We are less than two weeks from the beginning of training camp. NBA basketball is on the horizon, and with it comes the return of the greatest basketball players in the world.Before last season, we ranked the top 50 NBA players. It’s safe to say a lot has changed since then. This time around, we are expanding the list to 100 in an effort to show more love to more excellent players.For comparison’s sake, here are the top 10 players from last preseason:Given the relative uncertainty around rookies, we did not put rookies on the list. Cade Cunningham, Evan Mobley, and the like will probably join the top 100 soon enough, but we haven’t seen them in NBA action yet.Here are the top 100 NBA players entering the 2021-22 season.Andrew Wiggins made the best of his new situation in Golden State, becoming a genuinely impressive wing defender and a useful complementary scorer. He’s still prone to some brutal decision-making on offense, but if he can keep hitting 38.0 percent of his 3s, Golden State will be more than happy.The Warriors will be right back in contention next season if Klay Thompson is healthy. Golden State has loaded up on a couple strong free agents, and with Kelly Oubre presumably out of the way, Wiggins should have more room to play to his strengths as a downhill driver and cutter.Larry Nance Jr. is best known for his dunks, but he’s more than a vertical spectacle. He’s one of the best defensive forwards in the NBA, supplying elite versatility to any rotation. His quick hands, dynamic athleticism, and advanced instincts allow him to guard multiple positions, and he’s a force off the ball, where he racks up deflections.On offense, Nance has rounded into form as a strong complementary talent. He processes the game at a high level, and generally knows where and when he should be. He doesn’t domineer possessions, but instead thrives as a rim runner and occasional spot-up shooter, with the passing chops necessary to connect all the dots.The Pelicans will benefit from Devonte’ Graham’s arrival, even if it stems from unfortunate asset mismanagement. He’s a pretty perfect fit next to Zion Williamson — a high-I.Q. playmaker and one of the NBA’s most prolific spot-up shooters. He can play off the ball, or keep the offense zipping when he’s at the controls.Graham struggled at times last season, but he was also buried in a deep Charlotte backcourt. For better or worse, the Pelicans will put his talent on full display. He’s essentially the No. 3 option behind Williamson and Brandon Ingram at this point.Steven Adams is universally accepted as the strongest player in the NBA. That has its inherent benefits. He’s possibly the best offensive rebounder in the game, not to mention a pretty darn great defensive rebounder. He can also impose his will defensively in certain matchups, especially when harassing the league’s more post-bound centers.A rough year in New Orleans has dulled the excitement around Adams as a player, but he’s still quite useful, and should find a more amiable home in Memphis. He can feast on dump-offs from Ja Morant and bring his physicality to the city of Grit n’ Grind.Kelly Olynyk experienced a renaissance of sorts in Houston, seeing his workload expanded tenfold for a losing team short on NBA talent. While Olynyk’s numbers in Houston probably overstate his value — 19.0 points, 8.4 rebounds, 4.1 assists, .542/.392/.844 — he is no doubt a very useful, versatile offensive weapon.We should see Olynyk produce fruitfully in Detroit, even if he will now take a backseat to Cade Cunningham and Jerami Grant. He brings immense value as a floor-spacer at center, with the quickness and face-up ability to torch slower bigs on the perimeter. He’s also a physical, smart team defender, if not a great rim protector.Build your custom FanSided Daily email newsletter with news and analysis on Philadelphia 76ers and all your favorite sports teams, TV shows, and more.Your favorite teams, topics, and players all on your favorite mobile devices.© 2022 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

Sports Illustrated‘s Top 100 list returns, aiming to answer that question.As always, this is a wide-ranging exercise with a host of qualified candidates. There’s an abundance of information and analytical resources available with which to assess players. The rankings were again determined holistically by a combination of data and subjective evaluation, aiming to take players out of their team contexts and look at their skills and performance in a vacuum. These rankings are specifically for the upcoming season, and they do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2020–21.It’s best to look at these rankings as short-term projections, based on performance history and the impact of a player's age—some growth can be expected from younger players, and a degree of potential decline from older veterans. This is not a representation of a player’s trade or market value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact—on offense, on defense, structural and otherwise—and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill sets.Availability due to injury and future injury risk has always factored into this process—this year, the two resulting omissions were Klay Thompson and Jonathan Isaac. Stars like Kevin Durant and John Wall are making their returns from serious setbacks. Others, like Kemba Walker and Kristaps Porzingis, are already banged up to start the season. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year’s list, click here. We also compiled a watch list of 12 young players who could make the top 100 for years to come. This is the first Top 100 list without Rob Mahoney, who along with Ben Golliver set the standard for this process over the better part of the past decade. Rob’s 2020 list provided a particularly valuable starting point. SI NBA writers Rohan Nadkarni, Michael Shapiro and Ben Pickman provided valuable feedback and contributed to the player entries.For further reference, explore SI.com’s Top 100 Players of 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. This year's list incorporated data and statistical context from Basketball-Reference, NBA.com, ESPN.com and Synergy Sports.Let the debates begin! Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports; Kevin Jairaj/USA TODAY Sports; Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports; Greg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports; Troy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports; Kelvin Kuo/USA TODAY Sports100. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursThe Spurs are in the midst of pivoting to a new era, with DeMar DeRozan’s and LaMarcus Aldridge’s contracts set to expire after 2020–21. So who will lead San Antonio forward? Murray is likely the franchise headliner. He isn’t a prototypical point guard, but Murray’s athletic gifts are undeniable. He’s a superb on-ball defender, sporting a 6' 10\" wingspan that makes life increasingly difficult for opposing guards. Murray’s ability to upsize onto larger guards provides significant value, as does his ability to wreak havoc in passing lanes. There’s a significant dose of uncertainty for San Antonio after two decades of sustained success. Murray’s defensive excellence should help stabilize the ship. His defensive value and transition prowess lands him the final spot on our Top 100, and he’ll need to improve his half-court offense to move much higher. Murray attempted fewer than two threes per game last season, and his reticence from beyond the arc isn’t an isolated statistic. He doesn’t quite explode to the rim in the half court, nor does he look to create his own shot. He’s often too content to probe and dish, limiting his scoring impact in a middling offense. Let’s hope Murray truly takes the reins of San Antonio’s offense after an underwhelming offensive campaign in 2019–20. —Michael ShapiroGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated99. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatHow important is Robinson to the Heat’s offense? When he, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo shared the floor last season, Miami had an offensive rating of 115.8, practically equivalent to the all-time mark of 115.9 set by the Mavericks in 2020. Without Robinson, lineups including Butler and Adebayo could manage an offensive rating of only 108.8, which would have ranked in the bottom third of the league. Simply put, Robinson’s presence is the difference between a historic offense and a middling one. And it’s all because of the pressure he puts on defenses with his otherworldly shooting. If his breakout year doesn’t prove to be a massive fluke, Robinson will be one of the best floor spacers in NBA history. He shot 46.0% on catch-and-shoot looks in the 2019–20 season. That means his effective field goal percentage on such shots is 69%, which is higher than what LeBron James shoots on attempts within five feet. Only 26 years old, Robinson should have time to grow the other areas of his game. His defense improved throughout the playoffs, though he’ll still be targeted on that end. And his offensive game could use an extra flourish here and there, or at least one counter to teams who can doggedly chase him off the arc (as the Lakers did in the Finals.) As Robinson rounds out his game, he will continue to [ahem] shoot up this list. —Rohan Nadkarni98. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsOne of the most impressive parts of the Nuggets’ most recent Western Conference finals run was that they won two thrilling playoff series without Barton. The 29-year-old small forward started 58 games for the Nuggets last season and was among the team’s most consistent contributors. He averaged 15.1 points and 6.3 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.5% from three and playing a multitude of roles. Simply put, he was Denver’s third-most-reliable player. Barton left the bubble on Aug. 19 with a knee injury, after playing just a single half of an Orlando scrimmage. But heading into this season, those within the Nuggets organization continue to echo his importance. “We’re not where we are without Will,” new GM Calvin Booth recently said. Barton, a former second-round pick of the Trail Blazers, was traded to Denver in the middle of the 2014–15 season as part of a deal that sent shooting guard Aaron Afflalo to Portland. And while Barton was once viewed as merely a solid wing defender off the bench, he has gone on to start 155 games for Denver, almost all of which have come in the last three seasons. It’s possible that Michael Porter Jr. might cut into Barton’s role this season, but the veteran small forward will surely be a key part of another Nuggets team with title aspirations. —Ben Pickman97. Jonas Valančiūnas, Memphis GrizzliesValančiūnas isn’t earning All-NBA honors anytime soon, but Memphis’s big man remains a legitimate problem for defenses on the low block. Valančiūnas posted a 60.6 effective field goal percentage in 2019–20, averaging 0.97 points per possession on post-up attempts. The Lithuanian big man made his mark in the NBA as a skilled offensive big, though he often lacked the physicality expected from a player his size during his seven seasons in Toronto. The move to Memphis has brought out the best in Valančiūnas. He snagged a career-high 11.3 rebounds per game last season, providing a dose of brute strength next to talented youngsters Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke. Valančiūnas remains a key cog for the Grizzlies as they look to snap a three-year playoff drought. —M.S.96. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles Clippers Three-and-D doesn’t do Patrick Beverley justice because it doesn’t account for the fact he’s a Hall of Fame pest. Beverley is one of the most relentless on-ball defenders in the NBA, and he relishes his role as someone who exists to annoy superstars and anger opposing fanbases. (He can also delight people—I distinctly remember Bill Hader got quite a kick at a Clippers game last season watching Beverley harass James Harden.) On the other end of the floor, Beverley is a career 38.1% three-point shooter, which means he’s the kind of player who can stay on the court in the highest-stakes moments. While Beverley’s on-ball tenacity, sneaky-good offensive rebounding, and capable shooting would be welcomed by any contender, his game also exists in a narrow scope. His size (perhaps generously listed at 6’1”) means he won’t be regularly used on perimeter stars. And he’s not a playmaker nor a pick-and-roll option, though he nominally functions as a point guard. These limitations hardly make Beverley a liability. But without the proper infrastructure around him (like playing with superstars), his talents wouldn’t be as pronounced. —R.N.95. Harrison Barnes, Sacramento KingsHarrison Barnes always felt a bit like the fifth Beatle in his time with the Warriors, and perhaps that’s led to an underwhelming evaluation of his skill set entering 2020–21. He’s viewed by many as little more than a replacement-level wing, but a closer look provides a clearer picture. Barnes may not be a standout player in any single metric. But his wide array of skills makes him a valuable player and an underrated asset. Barnes has seen his scoring drop in each of the past two seasons, but a dip in volume has correlated with perhaps the most efficient stretch of his career. Barnes posted his second best career true shooting percentage in 2019–20, and he’s one of 20 players to make more than 275 threes at a clip of over 38% in the last two seasons. Barnes isn’t solely a stationary shooter. He can attack the rim and finish with authority, and he’s evolved into a somewhat savvy playmaker. His contract may dampen his value on the trade market, but Barnes remains an effective player nearly a decade into his career. — M.S.94. Otto Porter Jr., Chicago BullsPorter doesn’t exactly provide the most bang for your buck out of any player in our Top 100. He’s logged just 52 games in the last two seasons, and he’s on the books for $28 million in 2020–21. But despite an underwhelming tenure in Chicago thus far, Porter remains an intriguing piece for this season and beyond. If the Bulls find their way in the playoff chase this spring, Porter could play a crucial role. When healthy, he’s shown flashes as an elite three-and-D guy, sporting an impressive three-point stroke for a player of his size. Porter is one of just five players to shoot over 42% from three in the last four seasons (min. 400 makes), and he sports the size to defend larger forwards and the occasional big man. His fit in Chicago specifically is a bit curious. The Bulls are flush with forwards after drafting Patrick Williams, and there isn’t a deep collection of playmakers on the roster. Porter is a quality stationary wing, but he provides little off the bounce. Perhaps he can make an impact on a contender via a trade before the deadline. —M.S.93. Dāvis Bertāns, Washington WizardsBertāns’s nickname, the Latvian Laser, should move him up at least a few spots on our list, but that’s an argument for another day. What’s not up for debate is Bertāns’s value as one of the league’s most effective frontcourt shooters. The fifth-year forward continues to show impressive range from beyond the arc, making a legitimate leap in 2019–20 as he nearly doubled his scoring to 15.4 points per game. Bertāns has some skill as a roll man and interior defender, but those attributes are quite ancillary to his ability to let it fly from beyond the arc. Only seven players canned more threes last season. Of the 93 players to hit 100 triples, just four posted a better percentage from three. Bertāns can stretch the floor far beyond the arc, and he has one of the quicker releases in the NBA. Washington remains on the fringe of the playoff race entering 2020–21, but they could sport one of the league’s most exciting offenses. Bertāns’s excellence remains integral to the Wizards’ attack. —M.S.92. Derrick Favors, Utah JazzSimply knowing where to be at all times and never flinching is a skill unto itself. And after a year away in New Orleans, Favors returns to Utah as the league’s most overqualified backup center. Despite missing time with an injury, he finished just outside the top-10 in rebound percentage and lent defensive backbone to a team that struggled massively without him. While his mobility has waned to a degree, Favors has proven he can take away easy looks at the rim and is hardly ever out of position. He also shot a career-high 61.7% from the field, remaining among the league’s more effective finishers, capable of overpowering a mismatch when necessary. He’s also an underrated passer in the short-roll, capable of delivering the ball to either corner and greasing an offense in a pinch. Favors knows his strengths and requires minimal maintenance. It’s tough to place a premium on most bigs who present no threat to shoot from distance, and his lack of a jump shot limits his utility as such—the Jazz ought to make his minutes mutually exclusive with Rudy Gobert’s as much as possible. Situationally, there’s only so much value that can be ascribed. But Favors’s presence has long ensured a degree of reliable defensive competence, and his skills continue to age gracefully. And in a reserve role, his services are quite a luxury. —Jeremy Woo91. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersOn June 20, 2019, the Suns traded Warren and the No. 32 pick in the 2019 draft to the Pacers for cash considerations. Just over a year later, Warren, who was in effect traded for cap space, emerged as one of the biggest stars of the bubble. He scored 53 points in Indiana’s opening seeding-game victory over the Sixers and followed that performance up with 34- and 32-point games over Washington and Orlando, respectively. Warren has always been a prolific scorer. He averaged 25 points per game as a sophomore at NC State, his final collegiate season, and reached double digits in his second NBA season. In each of his final two seasons with the Suns, he averaged more than 18 points per game. With Indiana last year, he recorded career-high 19.8 points per game while improving his field goal percentage from 48.6% to 53.6%. While the 6’ 8’’ Warren is by no means a lockdown defender on the wing, he also showed improvement on that end of the floor. The Pacers preached continuity this offseason and have returned the core of their roster, meaning that Warren will yet again be a key scorer for an Eastern Conference playoff hopeful. —B.P.Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports90. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersAt 34 years old, Williams remains one of the most professional scorers in the league. He averaged 18.2 points per game for the Clips in 2020, playing 28.7 minutes a night off the bench. Williams can get hot at a moment’s notice, and many a coach has watched their lead slip away because of a Lou scoring barrage. With the right pick-and-roll partner, Williams can be particularly devastating, penalizing defenses who aren’t fully confident in their coverages. Efficiency is a bit of a bugaboo here, however. Williams ranked in the top five pick-and-roll ballhandlers in terms of frequency last season, but he generated only 0.92 points per possession on those plays. That number is not terrible and certainly above average, but it’s a reminder there are sometimes better looks to be had when Williams commands the offense while some of his more illustrious teammates are on the floor. Also, his size makes him an easy target on defense. All of that being said, if you are in desperate need of a bucket, you could do a lot worse than Williams. —R.N89. Serge Ibaka, Los Angeles ClippersNow entering his 12th NBA season, Ibaka remains one of the most versatile bigs in the league. After being used primarily as a power forward throughout the first decade of his career, including his first season in Toronto, the 31-year-old Ibaka played the majority of his minutes last year as the Raptors’ center. In doing so, he provided Toronto with a capable floor-spacer from the perimeter, shooting 38.5% from three, his best mark since 2016–17. While Ibaka might not be as much of a rim protector as he was when he was a spry 22-year-old blocking more than 3.5 shots per game, he remains a smart and more-than-capable force on the defensive end of the floor. His two-year deal with the Clippers was widely regarded as one of the most economical yet potentially impactful deals of the offseason. According to Basketball Reference, Ibaka had the highest postseason win-share of his career per 48 minutes in last year’s postseason, after averaging a postseason career-high 14.8 points per game. In joining L.A., he will similarly be expected to play a key role for a team with title aspirations, and he will bring Los Angeles much-needed frontcourt flexibility. —B.P88. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn NetsDinwiddie has shown steady growth in each of first four years in Brooklyn, emerging as the Nets’ leading man in 2019–20 after Kyrie Irving’s season ended in February. Squint hard enough and Dinwiddie at times resembles Irving, though with considerably fewer acrobatics around the rim. Regardless, Dinwiddie is effective as the pick-and-roll initiator, excelling when he can drive downhill at opposing bigs. He remains outside any All-Star conversation, but Dinwiddie can be a passable engine for an NBA offense. It could be a bit of an awkward transition for Dinwiddie in 2020–21 with Irving and Kevin Durant now leading the Nets. Dinwiddie posted a career-high in usage last season, and in the games he did play with Irving, there was a palpable tug-of-war within Brooklyn’s system. But if Dinwiddie buys into his role, he could be an effective piece in a high-octane attack. Dinwiddie made 37.3% of catch-and-shoot threes last season, and he could spend a hefty share of minutes alongside Durant when Irving heads to the bench. Dinwiddie could also be in for a sizable new contract next summer if he continues his progression. —M.S.87. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsIt’s undeniable that Millsap’s best NBA days are behind him, but the 35-year-old power forward still remains an important part of Denver’s roster heading into the 2020–21 NBA season. When Millsap joined the Nuggets in 2017 on a three-year, $90 million deal, he helped shepherd a young franchise into the future, culminating, thus far, in Denver’s most recent Western Conference finals run. Despite his scoring output dropping to its lowest mark since 2009–10 and his rebounding total dropping to its lowest mark since 2007–08, Millsap remains a steady defender who is capable of playing a productive, limited role on a high-quality team. The four-time All-Star recorded double-digit points four times in Denver’s thrilling Western Conference semifinals series victory over the Clippers, including tallying 17 points in Denver’s series-altering Game 5 win. He returns to Denver this season on a one-year deal, looking to help the Nuggets reach their first Finals appearance since they joined the NBA in the mid 1970s. —B.P.86. Joe Harris, Brooklyn NetsBrooklyn Nets team president Sean Marks recently said that small forward Joe Harris “epitomized what it means to be a Net.” The 29-year-old Harris fully resurrected his career in Brooklyn after playing just 56 games in his first two years in Cleveland. He enters this season as a starter on a perennial playoff team, having signed a fresh four-year deal worth more than $70 million. Among the 208 players who have taken at least 400 three-pointers since 2017–18, only Seth Curry has a higher three-point field goal percentage than Harris. While his three-point percentage dropped to 42.4% last season—a decrease from his league-leading 47.4% mark in 2018–2019—Harris still finished the year tied for sixth in three-point percentage. On a team that is littered with stars, Harris also appears to be more than content staying out of the public spotlight (as evidenced by being one of the few NBA players not on Twitter). After inking his new deal, the former second-round pick told reporters that he “couldn’t imagine being anywhere else.” He’ll be a key cog in the Nets’ present and future, and as the modern NBA continues to emphasize the importance of consistent three-point shooters, Harris’s value should only increase. —B.P.85. Marc Gasol, Los Angeles LakersAt 35, Gasol is no longer the same player he was back in the early to mid-2010s, when he anchored a Grizzlies team that was a perennial postseason threat. He still remains a valuable piece on any team he joins. While Gasol averaged 19.5 points per game in the 2016–17 season, that number dropped to a career-low 7.5 points per game last year, in his first full season with the Raptors. The Spanish center’s post-up game has diminished, but he has been more open to taking three-pointers in recent years, shooting 38.5% for Toronto in 2019–20. The former Defensive Player of the Year remains a force on that end of the court, using his high IQ and strong instincts to make an impact. As an example, he was part of all four of Toronto’s best defensive lineups that logged at least 50 minutes. “I use a lot of communication as a center,” Gasol said recently. “You’re behind them. I think communication builds trust and it solves problems.” Originally a Lakers second-round pick, he’ll finally join the franchise that drafted him after signing a two-year veteran minimum contract. L.A. had the league’s third-best defensive rating last year, behind just Milwaukee and Gasol’s old team, Toronto, and he should further solidify an already strong defensive group. —B.P.84. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPerhaps because he plays in Sacramento, it’s gone somewhat unnoticed how downright Curry-esque Hield’s shooting has been since entering the NBA in 2016–17. Hield has the sixth-most threes in basketball over the last four seasons. Of the 16 players with at least 600 made triples in that span, Hield leads the pack in three-point percentage. The Oklahoma product shot a blistering 41.3% on catch-and-shoot triples last season. He ranked in the top 10 in pull-up threes made. Few players in the league are as talented at one specific skill. Hield may be a lethal three-point shooter, but he’s not earning All-NBA honors anytime soon. He’s not a physically imposing defender, and he’ll deliver his fair share of mental lapses on that end of the floor. Hield remains a middling playmaker, with limited skill off the bounce. Sacramento didn’t do him any favors playing at the league’s No. 20 pace last season, limiting the effectiveness of both him and De’Aaron Fox. A stylistic shift could boost both of Sacramento’s backcourt pieces in 2020–21. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated83. Goran Dragić, Miami HeatComing off the bench full-time for the first time since 2011, Dragić was still the Heat’s second-leading scorer in 2020. And when bumped into starting duty during the postseason, he took his game to another level, leading the team in scoring until his injury in Game 1 of the Finals. Dragić is a feisty competitor with a well-rounded offensive skill set. He’s often deadly in pick-and-rolls, adept at finding lanes against all varieties of big men. Dragić will pull up against slower footed centers who sag off him, or he’ll find a way to snake around a smaller five who wants to dance on the perimeter. He’s also a willing lob thrower, and when playing off the ball he can space the floor all around the arc thanks to his reliable shooting. Interestingly, for someone who frequently finds himself in the paint, you’d think Dragić would get to the free-throw line a touch more regularly than he currently does (4.2 attempts per game last season). And while he’s a heady team defender, Dragić can struggle at the point of attack, particularly against quick guards. Those issues are hardly dealbreakers, however, and any contending team would be happy to employ a malleable presence as Dragić. —R.N.82. Ricky Rubio, Minnesota TimberwolvesRubio entered the NBA as one of the most-hyped international players ever. Fans flocked to YouTube to track down clips of the dazzling Spanish star, who first appeared in Spain’s top professional league at 14 and held his own during the 2008 Olympics. The Timberwolves selected Rubio with the fifth pick in the 2009 draft. And after three seasons away from the Twin Cities, the now 30-year-old guard has returned to the franchise that initially invested in him. Rubio’s first stint with the Timberwolves was largely marred by injury as an ACL tear cut short his promising rookie season and an ankle injury derailed his 2014–15 season. But the veteran guard has nevertheless been a solid, starting-caliber player, capable of being not only a prolific passer, but also a solid defender and decent three-point shooter. Last season, while with the Suns, Rubio averaged 13 points and 8.8 assists per game while also finishing the year in the top 10 in ESPN’s real plus-minus statistic for point guards. Upon being traded to Minnesota this offseason, he admitted he was a “different player than when I came here, and when I left.” While he won’t be the star they once imagined, he’ll be a solid veteran presence for a Timberwolves team building around D’Angelo Russell and top draft pick Anthony Edwards in the backcourt. —B.P.81. Eric Gordon, Houston RocketsGordon is a difficult evaluation after an injury-plagued 2019–20. Gordon underwent knee surgery in November, then battled a slate of lower-leg injuries throughout the season. When he did play, Gordon looked out of sorts. He posted the worst shooting season of his career, and Russell Westbrook’s control of the offense seemed to have a negative impact. But there’s reason to think Gordon’s dismal year was largely an outlier. With a new coach, new point guard and a clean bill of health, we should see the Gordon of old. At his best, Gordon is a perfect third guard in Houston’s offense. He’s an effective spot-up shooter with serious range, able to stretch the floor from far beyond the arc. Yet it’s not only Gordon’s shooting that makes him a valuable asset. He’s an impressive driver to the rim off the bounce, often punishing defenses who close out too hard on the perimeter. Gordon is more athletic and ferocious at the tin than his reputation suggests. His versatility gave the Warriors fits in the 2018 and 2019 playoffs. Gordon is a bit past his prime, and Houston likely regrets extending his contract. Value questions aside, Gordon remains an impactful weapon in the first year of the Stephen Silas era. —M.S.Jayne Kamin-Oncea/USA TODAY Sports80. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles LakersThe reigning Sixth Man of the Year, Harrell was the third-leading scorer on the 2020 Clippers. Now a member of the defending champion Lakers, LeBron and Anthony Davis can expect more of the same from Harrell. After initially making his name as a rim-runner with James Harden and the Rockets, Harrell has since added plenty of spice to his offensive repertoire. He’s an effective screener who has the hands to finish as a roll man. He can bully his way into favorable situations out of the post. And every now and then, he’ll also face up from the baseline and take his defender off the dribble. Put all that together, and Harrell averaged a career-best 18.6 points per game last season. The reason he isn’t higher on this list is his poor showing in the postseason, particularly his defensive struggles in the second round. Harrell is undersized as a 6’7” center, which can be an issue against skilled fives or on the glass. With Davis and Marc Gasol, the Lakers likely won’t ask Harrell to be doing as much against bigger front lines. His newest role should be his most streamlined one yet—all he has to do is keep scoring. —R.N.79. Jerami Grant, Detroit PistonsJerami Grant enters the season as one of the most interesting players to watch throughout the league. After playing 26.6 minutes per game largely as a reserve with the Nuggets, the versatile forward signed a three-year, $60 million deal with the Pistons this offseason. According to the Denver Post’s Mike Singer, the Nuggets vowed to work with Grant and develop him more as a player, even offering him a similar deal. Nuggets president of basketball operations Tim Connelly later said publicly that the team was “under the assumption we would get something done.” But Pistons first-year general manager Troy Weaver said Grant was their top priority, and Grant said at his introductory Pistons press conference that the challenge of Detroit “intrigued” him. The 26-year-old will look to become a more complete player with the Pistons. He has proved to be a versatile defender and has shot nearly 40% from three in each of his past two seasons. However, it remains to be seen whether the former second-round pick can grow into a go-to scorer or merely a solid role player for years to come. —B.P.78. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzDespite losing in the first-round of last year’s postseason, the Jazz are again banking on roster continuity to pay dividends. Among the players expected to contribute in important roles is Ingles. The 33-year-old forward started just 45 games in 2019–20, his lowest total since his third year with the franchise, and he at times struggled to adjust back to a reserve role after becoming an every-night starter in 2017–18 and 2018–19. But he enters this season still playing the role of an essential secondary creator who won’t overstep his ability. Ingles shot 39.9% from three last season and was a steadying defensive presence for a Utah team that went 44–28. In the postseason, the 6’7’’ Australian saw his minutes increase even though he struggled, by his standards, in Utah’s lone playoff series, shooting just 35% from deep. There is little uncertainty to Ingles’s game, and he remains a crafty perimeter player any winning team would want to have. —B.P.77. Gary Harris, Denver NuggetsWill the real Gary Harris please stand up? A frustrating run of injuries has limited his availability the past two seasons, and his efficiency has dipped. But Harris is still just 26, and the established value of his skill set bodes well. His penchant for cutting and spotting up and his embrace of difficult matchups on the other end of the ball allow him to fit in with just about anyone. With the Nuggets’ most potent lineups likely to include Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter together, Harris’s feel for complementing others, limiting mistakes and making plays in a pinch has never been more critical. It’s one thing to find a player who’s willing to fit in, but another entirely when the crux of his game is so well suited for just that. The thought he might become Denver’s third star has subsided, but if clean health and renewed confidence are in the cards, Harris’s shooting percentages ought to trend back upward, adding the requisite punch that would return him to form. A thorough understanding of Harris’s value has always been best obtained by watching closely, not poring over his numbers. —J.W.76. Bogdan Bogdanović, Atlanta HawksThe Hawks shelled out $72 million for Bogdanović in the offseason, and his offensive skill set should make the contract a worthwhile play for Atlanta. Bogdanović projects to be an idyllic backcourt mate for Trae Young, sporting a 40.7% mark on catch-and-shoot triples in 2019–20. Bogdanović is a quality spacer, but perhaps more importantly, he sports the playmaking ability to take some share of the offense from Young. Atlanta’s franchise cornerstone is an immensely gifted offensive player, but the Hawks’ offense stalled at times as Young dominated possession after possession. Some balance should help both Young and the team’s development in 2020–21. Bogdanović also provides more than what you see on the stat sheet. He has a reputation as a fierce competitor and intense personality, and he provides important size in the backcourt alongside the diminutive Young. Atlanta has its eyes set on the playoffs in 2021. Adding Bogdanović was a major step toward making that happen. — M.S.75. Zach LaVine, Chicago BullsVolume scorers are perhaps the trickiest players to place in an exercise like this, and there may be no better example than LaVine, who placed 11th in the league with a career-high 25.5 points per game. As he’s matured, he’s curtailed some of his mid-range proclivities in favor of more threes and rim attempts, which has been a step in the right direction. Doing what he’s done is not an easy task, and capable shot-creators with his size and explosiveness are few and far between. Whether his preferred style of play—which has never involved much defense—can run conducive to team success is still the question hanging over his real value. He’s not an elite jump shooter or play finisher, nor is he a free-throw-drawing monster, and creating for others has never been a major piece of his identity, either. If he’s stretched himself to his limits putting the ball in the basket, LaVine will need to evolve in a different direction to make the most of his considerable ability. He remains one of the most impressive athletes in the NBA, and his ability to create for himself could still be meaningful to a winning team. His prime years may be defined by his capacity to adjust. —J.W.74. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix SunsThere were reasons for caution regarding Ayton’s outlook early in his career. His efficient rookie season was marred by a lack of physicality and defensive intensity, and he started out 2019–20 with a 25-game PED suspension. But Ayton’s 38-game sample last season should provide significant optimism for the young center’s future. Ayton is one of the game’s most skilled young centers, and with him flanked by two All-Star guards, a monster 2020–21 could be in store. Ayton’s offensive skills jump off the screen in a variety of ways. He sports a soft touch near the rim and around the foul line, and he’s a prodigious force in the pick-and-roll. Ayton averaged 1.16 points per roll possession last season. He shot nearly 55% from the field. There’s still growth to be had on the defensive end, but those problems should be solved with added experience. With Chris Paul now in the fold, Ayton could very well rocket up our Top 100 entering 2021–22. — M.S.73. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsWith Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green no longer in Toronto, Anunoby was thrust into a starting role last season, and he excelled. Anunoby is kind of the platonic ideal of a three-and-D guy. He shot 39.0% from behind the arc in 2020 and played stellar defense on the other end of the floor. At 6’ 7”, Anunoby is perfect for the modern NBA because of his ability to guard multiple positions and allow for lineup flexibility. The Raptors maintained their championship-level defense last year despite the high-profile departures, and that was in large part because Anunoby was ready for the responsibility of matching up with talented wings. While he may not be a pure shutdown defender just yet, OG has all the tools to enter the upper echelon of stoppers, and he’s already giving people trouble. His athleticism gives his offense a little bit of bounce as well. He doesn’t have to be a pure catch-and-shoot guy, though getting his three-point attempts up would be a welcome sight. With Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka now gone as well, the Raptors are well removed from their 2019 championship squad. Expect an even bigger role for Anunoby moving forward. — R.N.72. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksIt’s quite possible Lopez exemplifies the shift in the role of the modern big man better than any other player in the league. Throughout his first six NBA seasons with the Nets, he took just seven total three-pointers. But in 2016–17, he fired 387 threes, up from 14 total the year prior. Lopez saw his three-point percentage drop from 36.5% to 31.4% last season, his second in Milwaukee. However, he remained an ideal stretch five who frequently stepped out on the perimeter, but was still able to punish smaller defenders around the rim. The 32-year-old center also has evolved into a centerpiece of Milwaukee’s league-best defense, finishing fifth overall in ESPN’s real plus-minus for centers last year and third in defensive real plus-minus. While Lopez played just 26.7 minutes per game in the regular season, his minutes increased to 32.8 per game in the playoffs. Expect a similar trend this season with the team looking to make its first finals appearance since the 1973–74 season. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated71. JJ Redick, New Orleans PelicansDon’t be fooled by the quantity of podcasts, entering his 15th season, Redick remains one of the most accomplished marksmen in the Association. In his first season with the Pelicans, the veteran had the second-best three-point shooting mark of his career, connecting on 45.3% of his attempts from beyond the arc. If anything, Redick was slightly underutilized on a young New Orleans team, playing his fewest minutes per game (26.4) since 2011. Redick offers space as soon as he steps on the floor, and his conditioning at age 36 should be commended. His constant movement generates open looks despite the undivided attention of his defender. While Redick’s own defense isn’t sterling—the Pels were 3.7 points per 100 possessions better defensively with Redick off the floor—he’s still more than capable of staying on the court in high leverage moments, the key test for any specialist. Of course, while he has acquired a particular set of skills over a long career that can make him a nightmare for opponents, Redick’s narrow scope means he’s at his most valuable on a team already studded with stars. Whether or not Redick is in the perfect role for himself on an up-and-comer, he should continue to provide some much-needed room for Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram through 2021. —R.N 70. P.J. Tucker, Houston RocketsJames Harden has transformed the Rockets franchise over the last decade, but P.J. Tucker remains Houston’s heartbeat. Since the start of the 2012-13 season, he has played the most games (637) of any player in the league and even entering his age-36 season, Tucker is an elite defensive force. Only the game’s truest behemoths can gain an inch on Tucker in the post. Few guards can skate by him on an island. Houston’s switch-everything scheme in prior years would have been rendered completely ineffective without Tucker’s presence. He has his limits offensively, but finds a way to provide value on that end of the floor. He’s become one of the league’s most effective corner-three specialists, and he’s developed a canny floater in recent years. Tucker’s smarts and versatility have made him an invaluable cog in Houston over the last three seasons, and until further notice. —M.S.69. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksCapela is the forgotten man in Atlanta’s rotation after the Hawks’ offseason makeover. Much of the focus has been on the acquisitions of Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari, but the Hawks should have a marked upgrade at center as well in 2020–21. Capela isn’t in the top tier of centers—largely due to his limited offensive skill set—though when healthy, he can truly be a dominant interior force. Capela may in essence function as Atlanta’s most important addition. The former Rockets center is a gifted athlete. He’s a quality lob threat, and more importantly, he can hold his own on an island with wings and guards. Capela is at his best in transition. He feasted on free dunks off James Harden outlets in Houston, beating the likes of Joel Embiid and Nikola Jokić down the floor time and again. If Atlanta relies on a quick tempo in 2020–21, Capela could truly thrive. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated68. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsIt’s possible Smart’s career-best 2018–19 season—when he appeared to take a step forward as a scorer—was something of a mirage in terms of shooting. But if he’s proved one thing over the years, it’s that there’s a method behind his unique brand of chaotic good. Smart is an energy-giver in a way that few, if any, of his peers can truly match, flying around defensively to create stops, occasionally catching fire from distance, and ratcheting up the intensity level of a given moment. He’ll never be the king of efficiency, but he’s fashioned himself into a more reliable jump shooter over the years. Smart doesn’t always take care, but he always cares, sometimes more than he should, always for the right reasons. There will be nights he struggles to find the net, and others where one or two particularly inspired Smart shifts can swing the outcome of a game. He’s become an indispensable piece of one of the NBA’s better teams, and he’s earned first-team all-defense honors in consecutive years. And in an exercise like this that attempts to remove players from their contexts, his situational worth to the Celtics might even be slightly undersold. —J.W.67. Eric Bledsoe, New Orleans PelicansThe Pelicans come into this season as one of the NBA’s most intriguing teams, with a number of high-upside young players, recently acquired veterans and a new coaching staff eager to lead them to the postseason. Among those vets is Bledsoe, who joins New Orleans after nearly three full seasons with the Bucks. At times, he looked like a potential franchise centerpiece and All-Star-caliber guard alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Other times, the Kentucky product looked lost and unable to snap out of various funks. Bledsoe provides the Pelicans with defensive physicality and will certainly help orchestrate New Orleans’ offense, anchored by Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. But much of Bledsoe’s reputation has been defined by his playoff struggles, having shot just 25% from three-point range in last year’s postseason and just 23.6% from deep in the 2018–19 playoffs. He certainly won’t have the same spotlight on him in New Orleans that he did in Milwaukee, and as a result, maybe he flourishes for a team with more modest aspirations. He remains a difficult player to stop in transition and a solid rebounder, especially for a guard who is just 6’1’’. It’s unlikely he’ll ever make an All-Star team, but don’t be surprised if he looks more like the guard that averaged more than 20 points per game in Phoenix. —B.P.66. Robert Covington, Portland Trail BlazersCovington is largely an ideal three-and-D forward, especially on the defensive end. The Tennessee State product can legitimately defend both guards and larger wings, excelling as a weak-side helper. Only two players tallied more steals in 2019–20. Just nine finished with more blocks. Covington should continue to be a valuable defensive asset in Portland, where he’ll excel as a versatile frontcourt piece alongside Jusuf Nurkić and Derrick Jones Jr. Covington should help the Blazers secure a playoff spot in an increasingly crowded West. There are some offensive shortcomings to note with Covington. He’s more of a stationary shooter than anything on the offensive end, and his jumper ebbs and flows more than one would like. Covington struggled mightily from three in the NBA bubble, and while that may be a small sample, he’s never been a truly knockdown shooter. Perhaps playing alongside Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum will generate more wide-open looks in 2020–21. —M.S.65. Al Horford, Oklahoma City ThunderHorford has taken a relative tumble in his reputation across the league after an ill-fated stint in Philadelphia, but the five-time All-Star should be a stabilizing force for a young Oklahoma City team in 2020–21. Horford was relegated to spacer status alongside Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, zapping him of his best skills as an offensive player. Horford is a terrific interior passer and effective pick-and-roll partner. It’s easy to see him forming a quick rapport with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who is additionally crafty in the two-man game. Horford’s intelligence could have an effect similar to Chris Paul’s in Oklahoma City, though it’s unlikely to be truly reflected in the standings. For a team now deep into its rebuild, Horford provides professionalism and competence. He should be better in 2020–21 than he was in his final year in Philadelphia. —M.S.64. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesMemphis’s future is bright after a string of lottery appearances, and not solely because of Ja Morant. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke are two of the Western Conference’s more exciting young forwards, looking like a potential top three in the years to come. A little lottery luck has gone a long way, leading to plenty of optimism surrounding Taylor Jenkins’ squad. Jackson shined in his second NBA season, making a significant leap as a three-point shooter. The Michigan State product shot 39.4% from beyond the arc on 6.5 attempts per game, more than LeBron James, Jaylen Brown and Joe Harris. And Jackson’s skill isn’t solely tied to his value from three. He averaged 1.24 points per roll possession, sporting comparable numbers to Rudy Gobert and Bam Adebayo. He’s foul-prone, but a versatile defender, who should be even better on that end as he gets stronger. Morant has a pair of true weapons in the frontcourt, headlined by the former Spartan. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated63. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City ThunderThe Thunder’s premeditated decision to tear down a longtime playoff team came with Gilgeous-Alexander’s best long-term interests in mind. He makes his Top 100 debut on the cusp of stardom, and with another step forward in his development, this ranking may end up looking unnecessarily patient. There are few guards anywhere who check as many crucial, creative boxes: He handles with an unpredictable cadence, he’s dangerous in ball screens, boasts catch-and-shoot chops, and can lean on a reliable in-between game when he can’t get to the rim. At 22 years old—and standing 6’ 5”—Gilgeous-Alexander has displayed prodigious comfort in all those areas. He’s good at pretty much everything already, and in his third season will inherit a heavy on-ball workload for the first time, with shooters around him. The big unknowns are to what degree he can amplify his playmaking skills (in two seasons as more of a secondary handler, his assist-to-turnover ratio is a respectable 1.8), and just how dangerous he’ll become shooting from distance. Defenses will consistently key on him for the first time, and he’ll be tested. But based on all we’ve seen, it feels like a simple matter of time before his next meaningful leap. —J.W.62. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsFor a player who has yet to make an All-Star team, Nets guard LeVert has been one of the most talked about players in the league. He’s shown improvement in each of his four seasons, tallying career highs in points (18.7), rebounds (4.2), assists (4.4), three-point shooting (36.4%) and minutes (29.6) per game last season. But the question remains whether he’s merely a high-quality secondary option or whether he could lead a team on a daily basis, and in turn, whether he could be the centerpiece of a trade for another star. This summer, LeVert shed some light on that question, leading the shorthanded Nets to a 5–3 record as he moved from a secondary scorer to a primary ballhandler and scoring role in the bubble. And while the Raptors discharged the Nets in four games, the 6' 6\" guard averaged 20.5 points and 9.5 assists per contest on 18 shots per game. LeVert admitted during media week that he’s heard the noise around his name in rumors, but said that team general manager Sean Marks has been an “open book” in terms of keeping the 26-year-old informed. “Whatever happens, it was meant to be,” LeVert said recently. Maybe he’ll become the Nets’ true third star alongside Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, or maybe he’ll get moved. Either way, LeVert has shown steady improvement throughout his career, and has a strong foundation to build off. —B.P.61. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicIs Gordon still an up-and-coming player, or has he hit his ceiling? It’s a question that remains tough to definitively answer, and one that can similarly be asked about the Magic. Still just 25 years old, Gordon averaged 14.4 points on just over 12 shots per game last season, down from the past two. He remains a versatile forward capable of guarding four positions if needed, but it also appears clear with every season that he’ll never be more than an average three-point shooter, thus limiting his offensive ceiling. Gordon still flashes glimpses that remind people of Blake Griffin, Draymond Green and Pascal Siakam, but there are other times he looks like he’d be better suited as a secondary or tertiary option. Gordon is no doubt a capable player, but with unrestricted free agency two full seasons away, more clarity about his future—or how teams value him—will come sooner than later. —B.P.60. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersBoston appeared to pass on taking Turner in a potential Gordon Hayward sign-and-trade, perhaps a questionable decision given Turner’s impressive talent. Though he isn’t exactly a brick wall on the low block, he’s established himself as an elite weak-side shot blocker, with 2.1 blocks per game in 2019–20. Turner adds impressive stretch capability from beyond the arc as well, canning 37% of threes on 446 attempts over the last two seasons. Turner is a malleable offensive piece for the modern game. He’s likely worth the $52.5 million owed over the next three years. Turner provides quality versatility, but his offensive skill set does leave something to be desired at times. He doesn’t pair his range with any real physicality, and he’s not exactly quick enough to beat bigs off the dribble when they chase him onto the arc. Turner is a bit of a stationary shooter, albeit a quality one. His age and shot profile suggests he can be an impactful force for years to come. But without further offensive development, there is likely a ceiling on Turner’s potential. —M.S.59. John Collins, Atlanta HawksAtlanta gave its roster a major makeover ahead of 2020-21, shelling out nine figures for Bogdan Bogdanović and Danilo Gallinari in a push to reach the postseason. The pair of free-agent signings will be joined by frontcourt newcomers Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu, creating a short-term logjam. But the added pieces won’t cut into Collins’s production as much as one may think. The Wake Forest has been a prodigious offensive force and will be a part of unlocking Atlanta’s tantalizing ceiling. Collins is an ideal frontcourt player alongside Trae Young, at least on the offensive end. His evolving jumper—40.1 percent from three in 2019–20—creates legitimate spacing in pick-and-pop scenarios, and Collins is downright lethal as a roll man. He averaged 1.31 points per roll possession last season, posting a better mark than Anthony Davis, Bam Adebayo and Rudy Gobert. Collins can put the ball on the floor in tight spaces, and he’s an elite leaper at the rim. You can quibble with his defensive shortcomings, as well as his lack of a true position at 6' 9\". But Collins’s offensive skills are undeniable. He should command a nine-figure contract next summer, even if he moves on from Atlanta. —M.S.58. Andre Drummond, Cleveland CavaliersThe Cavaliers acquired Drummond last February in a surprising, but relatively low-risk deal that sent Brandon Knight, John Henson and a 2023 second-round pick back to Detroit. The bruising center played eight games with the Cavaliers, who later picked up his $28 million player option. While pricey, Drummond would appear to be more of a short-term option for a rebuilding team. He’ll get the opportunity to try and mesh with All-Star forward Kevin Love in the Cavs’ frontcourt as the franchise looks to develop lottery picks Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and Isaac Okoro alongside them. Drummond is still a rebound eater, having led the league in each of the past three seasons. He is also a force around the rim, scoring the third-most paint points per game in the league (10.8). Cleveland finished last season with the league’s second-worst defense, and a full season of Drummond should also help improve those numbers, if only marginally. He said recently that his plan this offseason was “always to come back to Cleveland.” The two-time All-Star remains a high-quality player, but for better or worse, he’s still a stat stuffer on a young team. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated57. Fred VanVleet, Toronto RaptorsYet another Raptor who stepped up in the wake of Kawhi's walking away, VanVleet posted career numbers practically across the board in 2019–20. The 26-year-old recorded personal bests in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throw attempts and three-pointers made per game. FVV excelled in a bigger role, also commanding chief ball-handling duties when Kyle Lowry missed time with injuries. VanVleet is dubiously listed at 6' 0\", but makes up for his size by frequently barreling his way into the paint and collapsing the defense. He’s also long been a knockdown shooter, and he hit 39% of his threes last year while increasing his volume significantly. And he’s just as proficient on the defensive end. VanVleet’s defense at the point of attack is sterling. Watching him and Lowry hound opposing guards well above the three-point line is thoroughly entertaining. In the conference semifinals, Boston’s offense struggled mightily in the half court, in large part because of VanVleet’s ability to fight over screens and cut off lanes to the paint. Toronto will probably need even more from VanVleet this upcoming season. The departure of Marc Gasol takes away a halfcourt creator. Can VanVleet lead the team in assists? Can he lead the team in scoring? After signing a four-year, $85 million contract in the offseason—and with Lowry on an expiring deal—it’s clear VanVleet is a cornerstone of the Raptors’ future. There’s certainly room for improvement here, like finishing at the rim or bumping up his percentage on pull-up threes. Considering VanVleet’s path to this season—entering the league as an undrafted free agent, proving he could stick, then starring in a Finals against Stephen Curry—the Raptors should be confident he can continue to grow. —R.N. 56. Bojan Bogdanović Utah JazzBogdanović made a name for himself in the NBA as an effective three-point shooter, but the six-year veteran is a significantly more versatile offensive option than he’s been given credit for. Donovan Mitchell remains the headliner in Utah, and Rudy Gobert could very well earn a $200 million deal next offseason. While the Jazz are anchored by those stars, Bogdanović remains an indispensable piece. We’d be remiss not to mention his elite shooting in recent seasons. He is one of six players with at least 500 threes at over 40% over the last three seasons, and his range extends multiple feet beyond the arc. Utah often faces clogged lanes due to the presence of Gobert. Bogdanović’s considerable floor-spacing threat helps alleviate that issue. He also provides valuable scoring off the bounce, which is critical for a Utah offense that at times appears stuck in mud. It’s not blazing speed that fuels him, but rather an innate feel for the other nine players on the floor. Bogdanovic can slither around a Gobert pick en route to the rim. He can pump-fake his way past a defender for a two-dribble pull-up. It’s not the most aesthetically thrilling game, but he can light up the scoreboard in a hurry. Utah is often better than the sum of its parts given the roster’s offensive shortcomings. Bogdanovic’s presence is key to unlocking the Jazz’s attack. —M.S.55.  Domantas Sabonis, Indiana PacersThough he’s not quite a household name, Sabonis comes into this season looking to build on a breakout 2019–20 campaign. The versatile big played 34.8 minutes per game last season, setting career highs for points (18.5), rebounds (12.4) and assists (5.0) per game. His arsenal features a throwback post-up game, and he’s already a prolific screener and passer, throwing the third-most passes per game in the league last year. Indiana is now led by first-year coach Nate Bjorkgren, who has already publicly marveled at Sabonis’s ability. “From Domas being able to just put so much pressure on the rim,” Bjorkgren said, “I just know coaching against him in the past, his ability to screen and dive hard and how physical he is.” He made his first All-Star team last year, and with Victor Oladipo’s and Myles Turner’s long-term futures with the Pacers uncertain, Sabonis appears to be one of the franchise’s centerpieces. The 24-year-old was missed in last year’s postseason, and Indiana was subsequently swept for the third time in four years. If the Pacers want to remain among the conference’s top teams, a lot will be riding on the shoulders of their budding star. —B.P.54. Malcolm Brogdon, Indiana PacersIt’s hard to separate Brogdon from his frontcourt partner, Domantas Sabonis, hence their adjacent placement on this list. The two displayed an almost immediate chemistry in pick-and-roll situations last year, Brogdon’s first with the franchise. The 6' 5\" Brogdon is the epitome of a combo guard, fully able to play either an on-ball or off-ball role. He averaged 16.5 points and 7.1 assists in 2019–20 and will again play a central role in orchestrating a Pacers attack that features not only Sabonis, but also T.J. Warren, Myles Turner and Victor Oladipo. How Brogdon will fit alongside Oladipo is among Indiana’s biggest questions heading into this season. Brogdon also saw his three-point shooting slip from 42.6% in 2018–19, his last year with Milwaukee, to just 32.6% with the Pacers. But the crafty Brogdon has outperformed expectations throughout the entirety of his career, and seems poised for a return to form with more help around him. —B.P.53. Gordon Hayward, Charlotte HornetsHayward’s ill-fated Boston tenure has diminished his perceived value across the league, but despite some dampened athleticism, he joins the Hornets as a still-impactful offensive force. Hayward is a quality shooter, to be sure, but that’s arguably the least impressive element of his dynamic skill set. Hayward sports the instincts of a point guard. He’s quick to advance the ball up the floor in transition, and he’s an expert at skipping the ball from the wing to the opposite corner with either hand. Hayward also excels snaking in and out of the pick-and-roll, able to keep defenders on his hip before contorting his body around bigs around the rim. Don’t let his injury history obscure his offensive value. He was relegated to secondary scorer status in Boston, spending most nights as a spot-up specialist, but could see a relative career revival in Charlotte. Hayward can dictate much of the offense alongside LaMalo Ball, and we could even see a sneaky two-man game develop between them. Charlotte would be smart to increase its pace with Hayward and Ball, capitalizing on each player’s vision and skill in the open court. Is $120 million too rich for Hayward? Perhaps. But he should still make a marked impact with the given good health in 2020–21. —M.S.52. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersHarris has emerged as an effective three-point shooter in recent seasons, canning 39.3% of triples over the last three seasons on fairly significant volume. But forcing Harris to largely stand on the perimeter seems to be an underutilization of his skills. He sports a smooth jumper off the bounce, and while he’s not the most explosive leaper, he’s one of the league’s more creative finishers for a player of his size. Harris’s first two years in Philadelphia have been marred by a misuse of his talents, but Brett Brown shouldn’t be completely excoriated. Philadelphia is led by a behemoth center and a point guard without any discernible jump shot, and last year’s roster featured a stunning lack of shooters. Harris was often the lone spot-up option on the floor. Doc Rivers’s tenure should be different. Seth Curry will open up the floor to a significant degree. Simmons should take at least a small step forward with his shot. Let’s hope Harris earns a greater share of playmaking duties in 2020–21, allowing his impressive offensive arsenal to shine. —M.S.51. John Wall, Houston RocketsPlacing Wall in the point guard hierarchy as he returns from multiple serious injuries in his left leg, including a torn Achilles, is a precarious exercise. He returns to the Top 100 as a member of the Rockets, having missed the better part of the last three seasons and trying to regain his footing. Wall is purportedly close to full strength, but a scary question hangs over what remains of his prime years: What happens if the fastest player in the NBA loses any meaningful amount of the interplanetary burst that made him great? Of course, Wall is a terrific passer, but his ability to stretch defenses in transition has always played a role in his gaudy assist totals. He’s always been ball-dominant, and his three-point shooting has rarely been far above average, with his 37% clip over 41 games in 2017–18 looking like an outlier. Wall now joins a Houston team in a role that will stretch the limits of his skill set, as a defined second star alongside the NBA’s usage god himself, James Harden. Even if he looks like his old self, he’ll be asked to mesh in a way he never has before, spotting up, cutting and making himself useful when the ball isn’t in his hands. If the reports about his return to form are accurate, Wall should make this ranking look foolish. But as he hits the other side of 30, his checkered health history, volatile shooting splits, and limited versatility are inseparable from the value conversation. —J.W.50. Mike Conley, Utah JazzConley got off to a rocky start in Utah, adjusting alongside another ball-dominant guard in Donovan Mitchell and appearing in just 47 games due to injuries. By February and March, his play had returned to his usual standard, and he was mostly effective in the bubble, assuaging concerns that his performance level was anywhere close to cratering. Now 33, he remains one of the league’s more calming forces, historically great at limiting turnovers, reading the floor and knowing where the ball should be at any given time. Between some inevitable physical decline, his limited impact on defense and a drop in efficiency, there’s some slight regression taking place. But the tenets of Conley’s game—heady play, dangerous jump shooting, and comfort under pressure—remain sharp as ever. He may not be the piece that gets the Jazz over the hump, but a second full season, health pending, will offer a far better sense of what he has left in the tank. As the third wheel on a well-built team, with a heightened comfort level, Conley is poised to bounce back in a meaningful way. —J.W.49. Danilo Gallinari, Atlanta HawksThe addition of top free agent Gallinari will surely boost a Hawks team that went 20–47 last season. Whether starting or coming off the bench, the 32-year-old remains a high-quality piece, providing his team with a mix of perimeter shooting and fairly versatile defending. While he hasn’t played more than 70 games in a season since 2012–13, Gallinari was a solid contributor for the Thunder last year, averaging 18.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists while averaging less than 30 minutes of action. A 40.5% shooter from three, Gallinari will help the Hawks on the perimeter, as Atlanta was the league’s worst three-point shooting team last season. He will also pair nicely with Trae Young, having shot nearly 42% on catch-and-shoot threes last year. While Gallinari’s three-year, reported $61.5 million contract might be a little steep of a bill to pay—it’s the largest multi-year contract ever for a player older than 30 who has never made an All-Star team—he should make a Hawks roster loaded with young talent more competitive in the short term. —B.P.48. Steven Adams, New Orleans PelicansWhile Adams rarely gets full credit for his services, he remains a king of positional nuance and, of course, a man of prodigious strength. He anchored playoff-caliber Thunder defenses for five straight seasons, regularly finishes among the NBA’s leaders in screen assists and offensive rebounds and occupies an unusually large amount of precious space around the rim. He doesn’t block a ton of shots. His presence dissuades all but the most daring drivers from approaching. Adams doesn’t shoot jumpers, but he frees teammates for open ones with well-angled, incidentally bone-crushing picks. Though he doesn’t rack up gaudy rebound totals like some of his peers, Adams’s dedication to boxing out has often led to extra defensive boards for teammates (see: Westbrook, Russell) and transition opportunities for all. Part of what makes him special is that, by all accounts, he’s never cared about those numbers to begin with. Even with a chunk of the NBA veering toward small-ball, Adams remains a difference-maker and an anchor. There’s a reason the Pelicans are banking on the Adams effect—that his ability to physically dominate tight spaces will create better opportunities for others, as they always have. —J.W.47. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersJust because he’s stuck on an inconsequential Cleveland team doesn’t mean Kevin Love couldn’t have value for a franchise with higher aspirations in the present. After an injury-marred 2019 campaign, Love played in 56 games for the Cavaliers during their shortened 2020. His numbers remained largely the same as they have for most of his tenure with the Cavs, averaging 17.6 points and 9.8 rebounds per game, while shooting 37.4% from three. Perhaps the biggest issue for Love is how he plays for a rebuilding team mired in obscurity. His most notable highlight from last season was probably when he intentionally took a three-second call seemingly in protest of his young teammates Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. Love’s numbers indicate that he could probably still be of service to a contender, but it’s fair to wonder if time is running out. The 2008 draftee is now 32 years old. While 2020 was solid health wise, in the previous three seasons Love never played in more than 60 regular season games. And though the defensive spotlight on him was artificially heightened because of the Cavs Finals runs of yesteryear, Love is still far from an anchor on that side of the ball. Those reasons are likely why he didn’t pop up during an offseason filled with trades, despite having a contract that runs only through 2023—and actually decreases in value his final season. Unless a motivated Love again plays for a team with some level of competitiveness, it can be difficult to discern where he fits into the NBA landscape. That’s how a five-time All-Star ends up floating around the middle of this list. — R.NBrad Rempel/USA TODAY Sports46. D’Angelo Russell, Minnesota TimberwolvesRussell enters the year hoping to lead the Timberwolves to just their second postseason appearance since 2003–04, in what will be his first full season with the franchise. Russell was traded to Minnesota last February and averaged 21.7 points and 6.6 assists per game in 12 games with the team. He has developed into a productive player, capable of playing both on- and off-ball, and he should elevate his close friend and franchise cornerstone Karl-Anthony Towns. Russell will also likely spend a lot of time playing alongside veteran guard Ricky Rubio, whom Russell recently said will take pressure off him in much the same way he did for Devin Booker in Phoenix and Donovan Mitchell in Utah. While Russell has struggled defensively, Minnesota management has made it clear that they view Russell as a centerpiece of the franchise. After months of waiting, Russell said he’s excited for what the season could hold. —B.P.45. Blake Griffin, Detroit PistonsWe’ll never see Blake Griffin return to his Lob City form after an array of knee injuries, but the modern version of Griffin can still be downright delightful. The former No. 1 pick is an effective point-forward and a quality three-point shooter. His passing instincts (always underrated) are as sharp as ever. It’s a shame Griffin has largely faded from relevance as he toils away in Detroit. Place Griffin on a contender, and perhaps we’d be celebrating his late-career resurgence. Griffin isn’t exactly a knock-down shooter, but he posts solid percentages considering his significant leap in three-point volume. Griffin attempted 322 threes in 2017–18 and 522 the next season, shooting a respectable 35.5% from beyond the arc. Only seven players hit more off-the-dribble threes in 2018–19, and Griffin retained his prowess in transition at 1.22 points per possession. Griffin sees the floor like few players his size. He’s a terrific big-to-big passer in the lane, and his vision out of the pick-and-roll mirrors that of a quality point guard. Let’s hope we see Griffin in the postseason again one way or another, after his disappointing exits with the Clippers. — M.S.44. Jusuf Nurkić, Portland Trail BlazersIt took more than a year for Nurkić to make his return from a badly broken leg. His triumphant comeback proved one of the summer bubble’s most exciting developments. He showed up having shed weight and picked up where he left off and then some, backing the Blazers all the way to a surprise playoff berth. The best part was how sustainable it all feels. Nurkić’s sublime passing skills and crafty interior game was abetted by a little extra vertical oomph under the basket. His defensive positioning has typically been sound, but he appeared to be moving his feet better than ever. He looked legitimately athletic. With his playmaking and sheer size, Nurkić has fashioned himself into one of the NBA’s best screen-and roll threats, able to command an extra shred of attention while teammates create off him, punish switches, and elevate to the rim when given space. Opponents can ill afford to counter him with smaller bigs, and while he’ll never defend much on an island, he’s harder to play off the floor defensively due to his toughness and commitment. Nurkić was inching closer to his fully realized self even before reshaping his body. He may have unlocked something extra in the process. — J.W.43. Nikola Vučević, Orlando MagicOrlando has a serious logjam in the frontcourt, with shoddy guard play and less-than-ideal spacing often limiting its ceiling. Vučević doesn’t seem to mind. As the NBA continues to emphasize stretch and speed, Vučević remains a highly valuable throwback big. He tallied the sixth-most post-up opportunities in the league last season, and only one more player logged more roll attempts. These aren’t criticisms. Vučević is a quality mid-range shooter, and he can finish effectively with either hand. At times, it still feels as though there’s something missing despite Vučević’s impressive point totals. Vučević’s defensive impact is middling. His rebound percentage and free-throw rates fell last year compared to 2018–19. But he’s become more efficient thanks to an increase in three-point attempts, and with different pieces around him, you still wonder whether he might have more to offer. — M.S.42. Victor Oladipo, Indiana PacersAfter tearing his quadriceps almost two full years ago, Victor Oladipo has yet to consistently display his old explosiveness. As an example, in 2017–18—his last full season—Oladipo attempted 10.8 drives per game, shooting on nearly half of them and converting his attempts at a 52% clip. Last season, despite just a 19-game sample size, he drove to the basket two times fewer per game, and saw his shooting percentage on drives drop to 39.7%. If Indiana is to maintain relevance in the Eastern Conference, he’ll need to re-acclimate himself. New Pacers head coach Nate Bjorkgren told reporters that Oladipo has looked like he has “a lot of bounce to him” this training camp, but it remains unclear whether Oladipo will appear in back-to-back games, something he didn’t do last year in an abridged return. The 28-year-old guard’s future with the franchise also appears to be in doubt, with trade rumors circulating. But a bounce-back would do plenty for his value, and the short-term health of the Pacers. — B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated41. Ja Morant, Memphis GrizzliesHow many point guards, let alone 20-year-old rookies, could have led the collection of parts on Memphis’s roster to the cusp of playoff contention? Consider for a second the fact that the tenets of Morant’s explosive style translated directly from the Ohio Valley conference, in transition and the halfcourt, without a fully reliable jump shot. Morant’s Rookie of the Year case was a simple one. He stepped into the NBA and immediately became one of its best playmakers, capable of delivering accurate passes on the move and near-impossible to keep out of the paint. Functionally ambidextrous as a passer and finisher, whenever he gets there, his devastating dunks and craft around the rim threaten equally. Few rookie guards have ever shown up quite so ballsy and unafraid, and while he’s still learning to curb turnovers and defend with intent, it matters that Morant cares less about showmanship and more about making the right play, rarely shooting just to shoot or passing for the sake of it. His brilliance aside, the young Grizzlies were just the league’s 21st-ranked offense last season. As his game evolves, so will the expectations. Still, you shudder at the thought of what might happen if he continues to meet them. — J.W.40. Kristaps Porzingis, Dallas MavericksThere are few players in league history quite like Porzingis when he’s healthy. For now, he’s still rehabbing a knee injury that will delay his start to the season. The former Knicks cornerstone is a true unicorn at 7’3”, banging home triples at range. Porzingis tallied 403 three-point attempts in just 57 games last year, and he provided significantly more value from three than his 35.2 % mark would suggest. Porzingis’s ability to stretch well beyond 25 feet creates significant driving lanes for Luka Dončić, and allows the Dončić–Dwight Powell pick-and-roll to thrive. Porzingis is no slouch as a roll man himself. He generates a healthy 1.17 points per roll possession, using his mammoth frame to rise above defenders. It’s understandable that Dallas uses Porzingis as a spacer so consistently. But an added dose of screening action in Porzingis’s diet should help both the talented center and Dallas’s superstar guard. — M.S.39. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeRozan is as steady as he is crafty. The 31-year-old guard enters this season as one of just five players to score 1,500 or more points in each of the last five years. Though the Spurs’ 22-year playoff appearance streak ended last season, DeRozan remained a productive force on the floor, averaging 22.1 points, 5.6 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 53.1% from the field. He effectively moonlighted at power forward for a shorthanded team in the bubble, his mid-range skills and craftiness still highly useful. Throughout DeRozan’s first decade in the NBA, he has always been a limited three-point shooter, never making more than three attempts on average per game. In his first season in San Antonio, DeRozan averaged just 0.6 threes per game, converting on just 15.6% of his attempts. While that percentage improved to 25.7% last season, DeRozan will always be a limited commodity from behind the arc, limiting some of his market value, but not his effectiveness. While a move to a contender could be an eventuality, for now, DeRozan returns to San Antonio, providing a stable presence and consistent scoring.— B.P.38. Jaylen Brown, Boston CelticsThere’s no team in the NBA that couldn’t gainfully employ Jaylen Brown, one of the sharpest players in the league both on and off the floor. Brown, in the absence of Kyrie Irving and with Gordon Hayward in and out of the lineup, put together his best season as a pro in 2020. The 24-year-old averaged career highs in points, assists, rebounds, minutes, free throws, and three-pointers per game. Phew. Brown has always been a heady player, thriving within his means and not trying to take on the mantle of No. 1 scorer. That kind of awareness is incredibly valuable to a roster like Boston’s, with an established All-Star in Kemba Walker and a budding superstar in Jayson Tatum. And that’s not to say Brown, who put up 20.3 points a night, can’t hold his own. For now, Brown is perfectly cast as Boston’s No. 2b scorer to Kemba Walker’s 2a. (Walker averaged 0.1 points more per game than last season.) Brown is the kind of player who can fill in gaps offensively, shooting well from the outside, breaking out in transition, or create a bucket for himself in mismatches. Defensively, Brown isn‘t Marcus Smart, but he’s more than capable of guarding his position onthe ball, and his athleticism means he can match up against both guards and forwards credibly. If there’s anything holding him back, it’s that Brown’s offensive repertoire lacks a little bit of flair. This isn’t an insult, but the limits to Brown’s game stand out when compared to a couple of his top-flight teammates. Though he may not have a devastating stepback or consistently collapse the defense, Brown, from the moment he entered the league, has been a significant catalyst for Boston’s consistent success. — R.N37. De’Aaron Fox, Sacramento KingsDespite being just 22 years old and having never played in a playoff game, Fox appears well suited as the future of the Kings’ franchise. He signed a five-year extension, reportedly worth at least $163 million, this offseason to solidify his future with the club. Fox saw his scoring increase to 21.1 points per game last year and he shot a career-best 48% from the field. Kings coach Luke Walton appeared almost too comfortable with Fox orchestrating Sacramento’s offense, considering Fox totaled more than 80 touches per game, averaging 5.26 seconds per touch, more than Chris Paul, Kemba Walker or LeBron James. The addition of draft pick Tyrese Haliburton should help reduce Fox’s workload in a positive way. While Fox is a blur in transition, he’ll need to work on his three-point shot to ascend into the top echelon of NBA guards, as he shot just 29.2% per game from deep last year on just 3.6 attempts. He has improved in each of his three NBA seasons, and despite playing in a crowded Western Conference, the Kings are banking on the Kentucky product to lead them to their first postseason appearance since 2006. — B.P36. Brandon Ingram, New Orleans PelicansBrandon Ingram came to New Orleans as the jewel of the Anthony Davis trade, but at the time he was anything but a sure bet. Ingram paired an impressive isolation arsenal with frustrating shot selection in Los Angeles, generating far fewer threes and free throws than are necessary for a player with his skill set. His final season with the Lakers represented a step in the right direction. Year 1 in New Orleans was a revelation. Ingram won Most Improved Player and turned in a relatively dominant offensive season. He scored 23.8 points per game on a markedly improved 39.1% from three, posting the same effective field goal percentage as Luka Dončić. Ingram’s free-throw rate continues to trend upward. His three-point rate has skyrocketed. He receives plenty of isolation opportunities in New Orleans, and while Zion Williamson should earn a greater share of volume in 2020–21, the two franchise cornerstones appear to be complementary cogs. Expect continued growth in Ingram’s second year with the Pelicans. —M.S.Steve Dykes/USA TODAY Sports35. CJ McCollum, Portland Trail BlazersWhile Damian Lillard provides most of the fireworks in the Blazers’ offense, McCollum remains an indispensable metronome. McCollum’s steady scoring punch is somewhat jarring from a statistical perspective: he’s averaged between 20 and 23 points per game in each of the last five seasons, shooting between 44% and 48% from the field. The statistical profile makes sense, as McCollum’s game isn’t dependent on his athleticism or lift on a given night. He sports a deep array of tricks off the dribble, leaning on shot fakes, spin moves and crossovers to create the necessary separation between himself and a defender. McCollum doesn’t sport the scoring punch of a true leading man, and his 6' 3\" frame still creates defensive issues next to Lillard. But Portland’s second banana remains a quality one, having helped drive the Blazers to the playoffs in each of his seven seasons. —M.S.34. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsDraymond Green played in only 43 games last season, averaging the fewest minutes per game of his career since his second season in the league. With the Warriors beset by injuries to the Splash Brothers, a restrained hand with Green made sense. Golden State was going nowhere in 2020 even with Draymond at his best, so trying to preserve his legs for the future was the right call. And speaking of Draymond at his best, placed alongside the right talent, Green is still one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA. He can defend all over the floor. He’s an able and willing playmaker. He can lead a fast break. And his intelligence reeks of years of Finals experience, which means he’s militant about making the right basketball play at every juncture. The issue for Green is how much longer his body can hold up. The Draymond of the Death Lineup—when he played center and helped unlock probably the best five-man group in NBA history—doesn’t exist in the same way. Green can still reach those heights of tenacious defense and textbook rotations/switches, but doing it night in and night out for every minute he’s on the floor is no longer realistic. The Warriors as a whole seem to be feeling the effects of their five straight Finals trips. Stephen Curry missed functionally all of last season. Klay Thompson will miss a second straight season after tearing his ACL. Green was never as great as those two players at their height, which means even a little slippage in his game affects him much more significantly. Draymond has always been able to compensate for his shooting struggles, for example, by playing some of the best defense in the league. Ideally, the relative lack of stress of last season and the long layoff will give Green enough of an energy boost to look more like the 2016 vintage as the Warriors try to get back on track. — R.N33. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio SpursThere is an ageless quality to the way Aldridge plays basketball. Despite teams’ knowing the core tenets of Aldridge’s game, he is still effective night in and night out. Aldridge has been a stabilizing force in his five years with the Spurs, three of which earned him All-Star appearances. He averaged 18.9 points last year on 49.3% shooting, grabbing 7.4 rebounds per game. And he remains a force in the post, recording the second most post-up touches in the league and shooting 47.3% on his field goal attempts from that area. But despite being largely a known commodity, Aldridge showcased a new skill last year, shooting three three-pointers per game, the most of his career, and finishing the year with a 39.3% mark from behind the arc. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich recently stressed the importance of Aldridge’s improved three-point shooting, saying that Aldridge has worked throughout the summer and into the fall on his perimeter shooting and “is committed to taking another huge step” in that category. It should help him age gracefully. In a contract year at age 35, Aldridge will look to continue meshing with San Antonio’s young guards and serving as a strong pick-and-roll partner with fellow veteran DeMar Derozan. In a Western Conference rich with talent, Aldridge’s ability to help shape San Antonio’s offense will be an important factor in determining if the Spurs can reach the postseason. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated32. Zion Williamson, New Orleans PelicansIt’s still mind-blowing that Zion Williamson has managed to live up to just about every aspect of his considerable hype: In the 19 games he played before the bubble, he was averaging 35.6 points and 10.2 rebounds per 100 possessions while often being deployed in short spurts, and the Pelicans performed like a top-half, playoff-caliber team on both sides of the floor. Williamson did all this without ever being in peak athletic shape—there’s endless debate over his health and playing weight, but he was inarguably more explosive at Duke. That manifested in a similarly effective, but more ground-bound play style, as well some pronounced defensive struggles as he played conceptual catch-up. Still, speculate all you want about the longevity of his body type, but you cannot argue with the results. When he was active, he was New Orleans’s best player. Williamson is a remarkable finisher around the basket, somehow unfettered by any and all comers, with an astute left hand and a multiple-jump explosiveness under the rim previously unseen in a player his size. He’s a smart passer and decision-maker who’s always been able to maximize his impact without having his number called, allowing him to, in theory, pair comfortably with a second scorer within a winning construct. Provided Williamson can work his way toward a physical peak, the surprising diversity of his game should manifest, and the Pelicans will do everything to showcase it. Instead of worrying what he could become, it’s better to save the clichés and just appreciate what’s already happening. —J.W.31. Kemba Walker, Boston CelticsThere are moments when Kemba Walker ascends to a plane of unstoppability that are absolutely thrilling to watch. Walker may not have the explosive or flashy quality to his game like some of his point guard contemporaries, and yet he still has periods of sublime scoring that leave defenders helpless. Those stretches when Walker gets going in the high pick-and-roll, pulling up on bigs who dare go under screens or driving by those who get a little too eager, are very satisfying to watch. Even with Jayson Tatum earning plaudits as Boston’s lead dog, there are moments when Walker looks like the best scorer on the team. Kemba has found a good home in Boston, where he doesn’t have the burden of being the No. 1 but can command the offense when necessary. He’s a high-volume, high-efficiency three-point shooter, and the stepback, midrange J is still as pretty as it was at Connecticut nearly 10 years ago. Of course, there are concerns. Walker experienced knee issues last season that will also cause him to miss the start of this one. His size makes him a frequent target on defense, and calls into question how effective he can really be in an ultra high-stakes playoff game. Knee, size, and defense problems are usually not kind to 30-year-old point guards, especially ones on max contracts. But those moments, people. When he does return to play, Walker is going to have one, two, three, however many of those nights when the ball can’t help to go in, like when he dropped 40 on the No. 1 Bucks last season, or 44 on the Pacers. Walker’s game isn’t as memeable as pull-ups from halfcourt. Don’t let that stop you from enjoying someone who is still a masterful bucket getter. — R.N30. Pascal Siakam, Toronto RaptorsThe honeymoon wasn’t quite as sweet for Siakam, who hit a wall without Kawhi Leonard during Toronto’s seven-game Eastern Conference semifinals loss against the Celtics. Siakam, who made his first All-Star team last February, averaged fewer than 15 points on less than 40% shooting and often looked overmatched as the Raptors’ lead playmaker. Still, over a larger sample size during the regular season, Siakam displayed significant improvement and did appear to be a potential franchise star. His scoring jumped from 16.9 points to 22.9 points per game in the regular season, and he made improvements in his three-point shooting. “I had to shoot [threes] in the NBA and I didn’t have to shoot them in college,” Siakam told Sports Illustrated’s Chris Mannix last fall. “I think that’s a big difference.” Siakam will continue working on his outside shot as he looks to develop a more well-rounded game. He is a versatile defender and pairs nicely with OG Anunoby on the wing. Now in his second season in more of a leadership role with the Raptors, Siakam will look to keep building on his upward trajectory. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated29. Trae Young, Atlanta HawksYoung flashed his prodigious scoring talent as a rookie, but he often looked overmatched amid a concerning amount of turnovers and a shaky shooting percentage. Year 2 was far more encouraging. Atlanta’s point guard finished fourth in scoring at 29.6 points per game in 2019–20, and perhaps more importantly, he turned in a far more efficient season. Young rose from 32% to 36.1% from three even with a leap in attempts, and he improved his effective field goal percentage by a marked margin. Young’s vision is truly elite in the half-court. He’s evolving as a pick-and-roll ballhandler. And even in a shaky situation, Young still managed to turn in an elite offensive season for a player of his age.Young’s 30-foot bombs create an obvious comparison to Steph Curry, but the conflation can be a little misplaced. Curry is one of the best off-ball shooters of all-time, wreaking havoc on defenses as he darts around screens and resets his position after a pass. Young’s approach, at this stage of his career, is more statuesque. He attempted just 105 spot-up threes last season, the same amount as Frank Ntilikina and (interestingly) James Harden. Young doesn’t make any marked impact without the ball in his hands. He turns the ball over at a higher rate than Curry ever did, and while Steph isn’t earning All-Defense honors anytime soon, Young remains a sieve by comparison.Despite his flaws, Young is a legitimately thrilling offensive talent, and he’ll inherit the best roster he’s had yet. Further refinement from Young on both ends of the ball in his third year could launch him into the league’s elite. Right now, despite his gaudy stats, he’s still outside All-NBA consideration. —M.S.28. Kyle Lowry, Toronto RaptorsIn the immediate aftermath of Kawhi Leonard’s departure, there were questions about what direction the Raptors would take. Would Masai Ujiri start tearing down the team and trade away his veterans? Instead, Ujiri put all speculation to rest when he signed franchise icon Kyle Lowry to a one-year extension last October. With the understanding Toronto planned to vigorously defend its title, Lowry had a remarkable 2020. The 34-year-old averaged 19.4 points per game last season, the second-best mark on the club and his most since 2017. Even at his advanced age and with years of playoff runs on his body, Lowry remains one of the most impactful guards in the game.He does everything you want. Pull-up and spot-up threes. An ability to draw fouls. (Fun fact: Lowry’s free-throw rate last season was the fourth-best of his career and highest since 2009.) Aggressive defense. But most of all, while his critics and opponents may find him to be a nuisance, Lowry is one of the most intelligent players in the game. He can seemingly leverage any situation to his benefit. Often that means trying to find a foul at any cost, but there’s also no question Lowry is willing to put his body on the line in a way few people of his age and size are willing to do on such a consistent basis. Toronto was a legitimate contender last year, and Lowry, with his wit, guile, and skill, was the biggest reason why. At 34, it is fair to wonder how much longer Lowry can keep this up. His style of play takes a physical toll. But with the emergence of Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet, the Raptors are hoping to lighten his burden. If this season does end up signaling a shift in Toronto, any team that takes itself seriously would welcome Lowry with open arms. — R.N27. Khris Middleton, Milwaukee BucksWhile Giannis Antetokounmpo has been at the center of the Bucks’ success in recent years, Khris Middleton has been an integral part of the franchise’s rise unto himself. He’s made the All-Star team in each of the past two years and has shown gradual improvement throughout his career, leading up to career highs in points (20.9), rebounds (6.2) and field goal percentage (49.7) per game last season. The former second-round pick also provides the Bucks with flexibility on the defensive end and is versatile enough to guard at least three positions. While a number of Bucks have put up underwhelming playoff numbers in recent years, Middleton has also been a consistent postseason performer, even upping his scoring average by three points per game in 2019–20. The addition of Jrue Holiday should also provide even more flexibility, as the Bucks’ newly formed star trio looks to lead the franchise to its first title since 1970–71. —B.P26. Jrue Holiday, Milwaukee Bucks Quantifying a player’s true worth defensively can be challenging, but the near-unanimous respect Jrue Holiday has earned from opponents going on the better part of a decade speaks for itself. His unique ability to make opponents uncomfortable, working them quietly off their line to the rim, taking away personal space without fouling, and bending but rarely breaking, has become something of a lost art. Holiday defends guards, wings and even bigs without flinching, his combination of strength and quickness at 6’4” proving unusually functional over the years. He stops the ball, he plays the passing lanes, he’ll switch onto anyone and he understands better than any guard in the league how to leverage his size against taller players. As Holiday’s final season with the Pelicans often demonstrated, no player alone can make a defense great. But the massive haul of future draft picks the Bucks surrendered for him had as much to do with Holiday’s lofty status as it did Milwaukee’s urgency. While Holiday is not a point guard by nature, he can moonlight on the ball effectively and grab and go off the defensive glass. He’s not an elite jump shooter, but he commands respect on the catch. Few players have the energy or wherewithal to provide elite defense as a constant, and accentuating it with a viable, high-usage role on the other end. Holiday still finds time to stuff the stat sheet. It’s hard to put a price on the type of creative optionality a player like that can afford his coach. His shooting percentages ticked down after the Pelicans traded Anthony Davis and should benefit in much the same way when flanking Giannis Antetokounmpo. Holiday remains as well-rounded a secondary star as you’ll find anywhere in the league, and time and again, he proves it. —J.W.25. Russell Westbrook, Washington WizardsSo what should we make of Westbrook after 12 seasons, nine All-Star teams, one MVP and (roughly) a million hot takes? Will we see the Westbrook of the NBA bubble, where he limped through the postseason as his Houston tenure ended in disaster? Or will Westbrook quickly return to form with his third franchise, reminding us all just how physically dominant he can be? There’s reason to bet on the latter. Westbrook was downright dominant for a significant stretch in 2019–20. He averaged 32.9 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in his final 20 contests before the season’s hiatus, carrying Houston’s offense as James Harden struggled through an extended shooting slump. Westbrook remains a lethal force at the rim and in transition. He’s an impactful cutter when he wants to be, and he quietly turned in the most efficient season of his career in 2019–20. Vintage Westbrook was arguably the best athlete in NBA history. The current version is still close to the top of the league.Still, the flaws are more obvious than ever with Westbrook. His jump shot oscillates between middling and broken depending on the week, and his stubbornness regarding said jumper can create plenty of frustration. Acquiring Westbrook means you get the whole package. He’ll bring his maniacal work ethic and competitiveness to each stop. A culture of accountability will be established. But with those benefits comes a certain cost. Houston nearly blew its first-round series against Oklahoma City as Westbrook domineered the action. A strong stretch in 2020–21 could carry the Wizards to the postseason. But in a given series, Westbrook’s shortcomings can sink his team. —M.S.24. Devin Booker, Phoenix SunsThe Phoenix Suns dug themselves a sizable hole before the league stopped play in mid-March and so, despite an 8–0 seeding game run in the NBA bubble, the Suns missed the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season. But Booker nearly willed his way to the postseason, averaging 30.5 points per game on 50.3% shooting in Orlando. A proven bucket getter, Booker averaged 26.6 points per game for the second straight year, leading the Suns in scoring yet again. While Booker is always a threat from the perimeter, his numbers from deep are also statistically underwhelming, at least by his standards, with him shooting just 35.4% from three, though the difficulty of his attempts has something to do with it. Phoenix’s trade for All-Star guard Chris Paul will surely help Booker find more space on offense. Still just 24 years old, Booker will look to continue his ascension into the league’s upper echelon of guards this season, as the franchise eyes a playoff berth. —B.P.David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated23. Donovan Mitchell, Utah Jazz The game continues to slow down ever so slightly for Mitchell, who is refining his naturally helter-skelter approach to scoring and coming off the best season of his young career, managing a 55.8% true shooting clip on 30.8% usage, making his first All-Star team and taking a major step toward All-NBA status. Mitchell announced himself in full over the course of an epic series against the Nuggets, trading blows with Jamal Murray, dropping two 50-point games, and pushing Denver to seven games, over the course of which he converted 53% of his twos, 51% of his threes, 94% of his free throws and averaged 36 points. He’s a challenge to keep out of the paint and gets separation for himself on the perimeter, and he does all that while still playing defense, standing 6' 1\" and never seeming to relent.Of course, Mitchell may never match that impossible hot streak again. But he’s ascended the ranks of the league’s most potent scorers for a reason, and there’s plenty more for him to accomplish. If he settles for fewer floaters and uses his explosiveness to put more pressure on the basket, he’ll surely get to the free throw line more than four or five times per game. Mitchell draws plenty of defensive attention and can become a better creator for his teammates during his frequent forays into traffic. Becoming less ball-dominant might lead to more catch-and-shoot looks and another uptick in his percentages. He’s only 24, and it’s all on the table. But Mitchell doesn’t have to do any of those things to be one of the toughest nightly covers in the league. And that’s the scary part. —J.W.22.  Jamal Murray, Denver NuggetsClearly enough, the Nuggets’ magical postseason run—which saw the franchise overcome two 3–1 series deficits—would not have happened without Murray’s stellar play. While many of Murray’s regular-season averages were nearly identical in 2018–19 and 2019–20, the Canadian guard’s scoring jumped eight points per contest in last year’s postseason. He scored 30 or more points in six of Denver’s 19 playoff games, putting up multiple 40- and 50-point showings, and also averaged nearly two more assists per contest. When the 23-year-old Murray agreed to a five-year, $170 million extension in the summer of 2019, some questioned Denver’s decision to anoint Murray as a franchise centerpiece despite his having never made an All-Star team. Now, such doubts appear moot, as Murray enters the 2020–21 campaign poised to build on his stellar playoff run. Alongside two-time All-Star Nikola Jokić and a series of promising role players, it seems as if Murray and the Nuggets will only continue to rise. “We have two superstars in Nikola and Jamal,” head coach Mike Malone said this past September. “And a lot of other really good, young talented players behind them.” —B.P.21. Ben Simmons, Philadelphia 76ersSneer at Simmons’s three-point phobia if you wish, but Philadelphia’s point guard remains one of the game’s most electric guards. Simmons is an absolute force in transition, bullying his way to the rim with a combination of size and speed unmatched throughout the league. The LSU product thrives off of turnovers, and he increasingly leans on his athletic gifts to generate free points for Philadelphia. Simmons won the steals title last season en route to his first All-Defense selection. He paired his ball-hawking skills with improved rotational awareness, anchoring Philadelphia’s defense. For all his half-court shortcomings, Simmons’s transition prowess and defensive dominance makes him one of the Eastern Conference’s most valuable players.Simmons sports the athletic profile to be a top-10 player. But the flaws in his game grow increasingly frustrating by the season. It’s not just that Simmons is a poor shooter. It’s that he’s an unwilling one. Philadelphia’s point guard attempted just seven threes in 2019–20. He attempted 16 midrange jumpers. Perhaps Simmons’s stylistic deficiencies would be acceptable if he were flanked by a cadre of shooters, but given his big-man costar, the lack of any discernible jumper can be downright untenable. Even extending his range past the free-throw line would do wonders for Philadelphia, further unlocking the two-man game between Simmons and Embiid. Perhaps Simmons will show some growth in 2020-21. If not, he’ll remain a tantalizing, yet frustrating talent on the fringe of the All-NBA discussion. —M.S.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated20. Bam Adebayo, Miami HeatSeemingly once a game, an opposing perimeter player will make the mistake of thinking they have a mismatch against Bam Adebayo. Catching Adebayo in a switch, said perimeter player often calls for an isolation and then tries to blow by Bam to the rim. And sure enough, once a game, that player learns they’ve made a terrible mistake as they quickly realize they have nowhere to go. Adebayo is one of the most well-rounded players in the NBA, and he’s the crown jewel of the Heat’s future. Jimmy Butler often refers to him as the team’s best player, and that refrain may be more than just modesty.Bam’s footwork and intelligence belie his age. At 23, he should already be a consistent candidate for Defensive Player of the Year. He can truly guard any position on the floor, banging with beefy centers or staying in front of speedy guards. His block on Jayson Tatum at the end of Game 1 of the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals was not only picture perfect, it told the story of how special Adebayo is. He wasn’t guarding Tatum on that play—but Adebayo timed his release from his own man to be in perfect help position on Tatum, he had the athleticism to meet him at the rim, and then the awareness to keep the ball in bounds and in Miami’s possession. On the other end of the floor, Adebayo is a fulcrum in the Heat’s motion attack. He’s a deft passer, and Erik Spoelstra often relies on him in lieu of a playmaking point guard to direct the offense. Bam is deadly on handoffs, and his jumper is steadily improving. After mostly being a rim runner his first two seasons in the league, Adebayo morphed into an elbow traffic cop in 2020, ultimately averaging 15.9 ponts, 10.2 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game. And he has the potential to be so much more. Just ask the Celtics again, who saw their season ended by Adebayo’s 32 points in Game 6 of the East Finals, including when he went on a run by himself in the fourth quarter, stunning Boston with a flurry of offensive moves to send them packing. Bam is No. 20 on this list, but he’s really just getting started. — R.N19. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn NetsThere always seems to be some form of discontent surrounding Kyrie Irving, who holds the crown as the NBA’s most mercurial superstar. Irving’s tenure in Cleveland ended with a trade demand. He exited Boston after a tumultuous two seasons, and his first year with Brooklyn featured its own share of controversy. But perhaps we’re focusing too much on questions surrounding Irving’s peculiar personality. Brooklyn’s point guard remains one of the game’s top scorers, and, paired with Kevin Durant, it’s possible we’ll see him hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy in 2021. Harp on the backpage headlines if you’d like. Doing so ignores Irving’s immense talent. There are few guards in league history as purely gifted as the 2016 champion.Irving’s sheer statistical resume in recent seasons shouldn’t go unnoticed. He’s one of two players (along with Steph Curry) to average more than 24 points per game while shooting over 40% from three in the last four seasons, and 2019–20 featured Irving’s most impressive offensive campaign. The Duke product averaged 27.4 points per game with a 54.6 effective field goal percentage, scoring 1.06 points per isolation possession. Irving is perhaps the most malleable offensive point guard in today’s game. He’s a dominant force with the ball in his hands, sporting the league’s deepest bag of tricks off the dribble. Irving is also a dangerous off-ball spacer, likely making him a perfect complement to Durant in 2020–21. Irving’s defensive shortcomings are notable. He’s not the warmest personality by most accounts. Yet there’s no denying his historic talent. Don’t be surprised if we see Irving dicing up defenses late into the 2020–21 postseason. —M.S.18. Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota TimberwolvesThere isn’t much that the Timberwolves star can’t do, especially on the offensive end of the floor. Towns averaged a career-high 26.5 points last season, while shooting 50.8% from the field. He was an impact player in the post and a top player at any position from beyond the arc, shooting 42.5% from behind the arc on his 5.9 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per contest. But on the defensive side of the floor, the Wolves struggled last season, finishing as a bottom-third unit, with Towns playing in just 35 games. His own defensive concerns remain as pronounced as ever. Towns will look to mesh with D’Angelo Russell, who is beginning his first full season with the franchise, and top pick Anthony Edwards. The Wolves have surrounded Towns with a number of talented pieces, and the hope is that this season will offer a better gauge of where the franchise stands. — B.P.Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports17. Jayson Tatum, Boston CelticsNo one in the NBA made as significant a leap as Jayson Tatum did in 2020, when he went from promising young gun to “Oh my god, this kid is about to be a superstar.” The 22-year-old was sublime for the Celtics last season, leading the team in scoring despite sharing the ball with vets like Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward. Tatum was bonkers, averaging 23.4 points, 3.0 assists and 7.0 rebounds per game. He shot a comical 40.3% from three on 7.1 attempts a night, turning his stepback jumper into one of the most lethal shots in the Association.Tatum has the talent to be a scoring leader one day. He can get a bucket from the outside, from the midrange, or by making his way to the rim for a finish or foul. Few guys this early in their career are supposed to have such a layered offensive game, but Tatum plays with the smoothness of a 10-year-vet. His three-point shooting was particularly notable after complaints about him settling for too many long twos in 2019. Tatum bumped up his efficiency last season, and what’s frightening for opponents is how he should only improve from here. Defensively, Tatum isn’t a lockdown guy, but he doesn’t cheat on that end of the floor, and he’s a key part of Boston’s elite unit. Tatum is dripping with polish and yet he’s so far away from his prime. He has many offseasons to tinker with his game. Maybe he wants to add more to his post catalogue. Or maybe he wants to perfect a baseline turnaround. With so many skills already in his arsenal, Tatum is building on a foundation much more advanced than a typical third-year player. And he has the prototypical size—6’ 8”, 210 pounds—to become one of the league’s dominant wings. The Tatum era in Boston is quite young, but he’s already been a key contributor on two trips to the conference finals in only three seasons. It would almost be shocking if Tatum didn’t bring Boston back to the Finals sooner rather than later. — R.N16. Rudy Gobert, Utah Jazz Employing the NBA’s top defensive center affords a certain degree of stylistic comfort: Over Gobert’s six seasons as a full-time fixture in Utah’s lineup, the Jazz have finished first, second, first, second, fourth and ninth in points allowed per game, often employing a plodding pace and making the playoffs in five of those years. Utah’s performance in the postseason has been a different story—draw the wrong opponent, and the 7' 1\" Gobert can look out of his depth rather quickly—but we’re talking about a two-time Defensive Player of the Year who’s made first-team All-Defense in four straight seasons. Indisputably, Gobert remains the best rim defender in basketball, he rebounds at an elite clip on both ends, he’s proved relatively durable for someone his size and he’s a puzzle opponents are forced to solve every night.Like an expert center back or rangy middle linebacker, Gobert forces an offense to simply maneuver its way around him, or avoid him entirely. It’s not so much as the shots he blocks anymore as the angles he takes away, and he’s disciplined, averaging just 3.3 fouls per 36 minutes. As with any 7-footer, some physical decline is eventually in the cards, but at age 28, Gobert remains a tad more mobile than you think, his length proving a great equalizer in changing angles and effecting shots when he’s forced to defend in space. Remember that when the Jazz have gone down in the playoffs, it’s been at the hands of elite offensive talents: James Harden, Stephen Curry and, last year, an ascendant Jamal Murray. They’re guards who can expertly manipulate ball-screen coverages and need just a sliver of space to launch deadeye threes. Lest we forget, most teams don’t have a player like that and have to simply deal with the massive, intelligent man walling off the paint as best they can. As Gobert enters a contract year, Utah will lean on him as long as it’s feasible. —J.W.15. Bradley Beal, Washington WizardsIn Year 8 of a still-underappreciated career, Beal stretched his game to its limits and walked away with another notch in his belt, averaging a career-high 30.6 points without sacrificing much in the way of efficiency. And he did so as the primary focus of nearly every defense he faced. He shot worse from the field on the whole with the added workload, but made it to the foul line more often and averaged a career-high in assists as the top playmaker in a transition year. He’s been perhaps the NBA’s most durable star, racking up minutes without complaint. He took a real leap in the absence of John Wall, and now the Wizards are betting on Beal’s unusual malleability as a viable fit with Russell Westbrook. He remains an elite catch-and-shoot player and could easily inch close to his old neighborhood of 40% from distance if all goes well. There simply aren’t many holes in Beal’s offensive game, with equal capacity on and off the ball, off the catch or using a screen. As the Wizards continue to bat away trade offers and build around Beal, the prospect of his game continuing to improve points to why Washington would hold. Having Westbrook around, you’d hope, will reduce Beal’s creation duties, allow him cleaner looks as a play finisher and improve his results all over the floor. If he takes all he’s learned and demonstrated over the past two years, acquiesces a tad to his new teammate and stays just as effective, Beal could conceivably repeat his 30-point campaign with less exertion, and perhaps more wins for his team. There are players on this list who are more prolific, but few as consistent and reliable. —J.W.14. Chris Paul, Phoenix SunsEverywhere Chris Paul goes, winning follows. In case that wasn’t obvious, the 2020 Thunder are a shining example. After reviving the Clippers and nearly bringing the Rockets to the Finals, CP was unceremoniously shipped to Oklahoma City in the summer of 2019. Instead of trying to force his way out to a contender, Paul, who turned 35 in May, went to work and put together one of the finest individual seasons of his career. CP averaged 17.6 points, 5.0 assists, and 6.7 rebounds per game for the Thunder, while shooting 48.9% from the field. The only other players in the league to average that many points, assists, and rebounds per game while shooting at least 48% from the field last season were LeBron James and Nikola Jokic. That’s how incredible Paul was, all while being a clutch-time assassin for a team that was a Lu Dort three away from upsetting the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Paul looked rejuvenated in OKC. Not only did he relish the role of playing point guard again, he told SI in December 2019 his body felt transformed after changing his diet and workout regimen after the trade from Houston. Paul now only eats plant-based meals, and hired a new trainer after injuries zapped some of his effectiveness as James Harden’s running mate. If those lifestyle changes are long lasting, then the Suns should be a legitimate force this season. So much of the conversation around Paul is about his large contract—and how he will definitely not opt out of the last year of his deal to give himself more flexibility. Well, CP was worth every penny in 2020. Count out the Point God at your own risk. — R.NKelvin Kuo/USA Today Sports13. Paul George, Los Angeles ClippersIt’s become almost impossible to separate the short-term playoff conversation around Paul George from who he really is as a player. Did George struggle during the Clippers inexcusable seven-game loss in the bubble to the Nuggets? Yes. Was the front office smart to sign him to an extension this summer? Absolutely. PG is far from a scrub. Let’s put that to bed right now. He was an MVP candidate in 2019 before hurting his shoulder. And he was carrying that Thunder team that also included Russell Westbrook. George remains an All-NBA caliber defender with an offensive game that’s expertly suited for the modern game. Once healthy, George was exactly what the Clippers needed last season. A deadly second option who could create for himself when called upon while being an absolute sniper from three. PG looked completely recovered from his shoulder troubles with the Clips, shooting a career-high 41.2% from beyond the arc. If anything, L.A. was too cautious with George, playing him only 29.6 minutes a night in the regular season, his fewest since his rookie year (excluding the 2015 season when he played in only six games off the bench after breaking his leg.) While George may fall short of being the true No.1 on a championship contender, it would be asinine to cast him aside as some kind of punchline. He has a recent history of some postseason foibles. He also once impressed LeBron so much that James dapped him in the middle of a playoff game between two heated rivals. At 30 years old, George isn’t an up-and-comer, but he still has time to rewrite the book on the kind of player he is in high-stakes moments. For someone with so much talent, the story is far from over. — R.N12. Damian Lillard, Portland Trail BlazersPerhaps to nobody’s shock, Lillard was the league’s most prolific player in the run-up to last year’s postseason. With a number of eye-catching performances, Lillard led Portland from outside the Western Conference’s playoff picture to the No. 8 seed, a run required after injuries plagued the Blazers throughout the regular season. Overall, Lillard averaged career highs in points (30) and assists (8) per game, while shooting 40.1% from three. He is also currently the league’s best long-range three-point shooter, taking 6.8 attempts from 25 to 29 feet last year and shooting 40% on them. Throughout the offseason, Portland made a number of key acquisitions, bringing in versatile forwards Robert Covington and Derrick Jones Jr., and center Enes Kanter. The team also re-signed forwards Carmelo Anthony and Rodney Hood. Lillard recently said that his message to team president Neil Olshey was: “Let’s go for it.” The Blazers are just one full season removed from making the Western Conference finals, and it appears as if another berth in the league’s final four is fully possible, especially if Lillard shows even more improvement this season. —B.P.11. Jimmy Butler, Miami HeatThe most interesting man in the NBA, Jimmy Butler found the perfect home for himself in Miami, where the Heat welcomed his aggressive playing style en route to a shocking Finals berth. In the process, Butler outplayed two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the second round of the postseason, and then with his two best teammates (Adebayo and Dragic) injured, he frankly single-handedly took two games off the Lakers in the championship round. Though he had some big nights in the playoffs—including his iconic 40-point triple double in Game 3 of the Finals—Butler wasn’t asked to be a traditional scorer for Miami in 2020. He averaged a modest-for-a-perimeter-star 19.9 points a game during the regular season, but he compensated by adding 6.0 assists and 6.7 rebounds a night, both career-bests. Butler showed a knack for controlling the game when the Heat needed him to the most. With a shaky jump shot, he turned in a Harden-esque 9.1 free-throw attempts a game, willing himself to the line whenever his team needed a bucket throughout the season. For all his past escapades, Butler was measured his first season in Miami, picking his spots offensively while playing his typical stellar defense on whoever was in front of him. (And for what it’s worth, the only other players with at least a 19.5-6.5-6.0 statline with better than 45% shooting were Luka, LeBron, Russ, and Jokic.)What Butler proved during the Heat’s surprise run through the East is that he can be the No. 1 player on a championship contender. Few players—even some above Butler on this list—can confidently make that claim. If there are any concerns, it’s that at 31-years-old, Butler is no spring chicken. His jump shot is a valid issue. And for all the leadership he brings, he’s not going to put up the numbers of an MVP candidate.Still, when the stakes were at their absolute highest, Butler delivered. And he did so with aplomb, flashing playmaking, defense, rebounding, and of course scoring in the Finals, giving LeBron a legitimate run for his money. Some people are already calling Miami’s playoff run a fluke. As for Butler? He told SI he has something up his sleeve for next season. And only it’s getting harder to doubt Butler’s will.10. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ersFew bigs, if any, are currently as dominant as the 76ers center. Embiid bullies smaller defenders and is too skilled for those who might be a closer physical comparison. Around the rim, he is a foul-drawing machine and additionally led the league in post-up points with 7.4 per game. Embiid also provides the Sixers with a consistent bail-out option, having taken the most field goal attempts per game with between zero and four seconds on the shot clock last season, making 41.5% of them. While Embiid saw a number of his counting stats decrease this past season, he’s poised for an uptick alongside a revised core that now features a number of sharpshooters, with the Sixers’ notably adding Danny Green and Seth Curry in trades this offseason, hoping to free up more space for Embiid around the basket. While durability remains a concern for the 26-year-old center, Embiid could very well be the best big in basketball. Don’t be surprised if he leads the Sixers toward a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference and a deep postseason run. —B.P.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated9. Luka Dončić, Dallas MavericksThere’s an abundance of ways to contextualize the incredible things Luka Dončić has accomplished by age 21. Suffice it to say, there’s a high likelihood what we’re witnessing is the emergence of the NBA’s next true alpha talent, and a player who could conceivably be in contention for the No. 1 spot on this list a year from now. He lands ninth on our list out of respect to the players ahead of him, but Dončić is closing in quickly, and, truthfully, you could make a compelling case for ranking him as high as fourth or fifth. At this point, it’s a matter of preference, a testament to the speed and manner in which he’s captured the attention and respect of his peers, and his savant-level capacity to control, and increasingly, take over the flow of a given game. It takes a truly unusual combination of focus and skill to function comfortably at the intersection of high usage and high efficiency, and it’s a challenge most players never master. Dončić is already there.In just his second NBA season, Dončić averaged 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists, made first-team All-NBA and the All-Star team, finished fourth in MVP voting and was the focal point of the most efficient NBA offense ever recorded. In two years, he’s worked his way up to 18th on the all-time triple-double list, having passed players including Draymond Green, Kobe Bryant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. If there’s a legitimate knock on him right now, it’s his 31.6% three-point clip, stemming from degree-of-difficulty attempts that defenses will often live with (conversely, he converted 57% of attempts inside the arc). But Dončić is a fearless enough shooter that you can’t leave him open, and his floor game is otherwise a challenge to pick apart, considering his exceptional passing skills and unselfish nature (he also finished third in assists per game). He’s not fleet of foot, but his sheer size helps protect him defensively. He looked capable of pushing the Clippers to the brink in the playoffs, before injuries, fatigue and bad luck derailed the Mavericks.The scary part here, of course, is how much time Doncic has to keep adjusting and improving, with the rest of the league throwing the book at him in the meantime. At this early stage of his career, everything is seemingly within his reach. What’s crystal clear is that his superstardom is concrete, and that there’s assuredly more to come. —J.W.8. Nikola Jokić, Denver NuggetsThe steady evolution of Nikola Jokić has been one of the NBA’s most delightful story lines in recent years. The Serbian center was the subject of fascination early in his career, showing flashes of brilliance despite his doughy frame. But as Jokić’s stature grew, so did the questions surrounding his long-term ceiling. Is he fit enough to survive extended playoff series? Can he command games as a scorer? Can you win with a center as your leading man in the modern era? Jokić has answered all those questions with relative ease. The 2019 playoffs served as the greatest affirmation of Jokić’s brilliance. He became the second player in NBA history to average 25 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists in a single playoffs, and his 64-minute triple-double against the Blazers served as a watershed moment in his career. Jokić doesn’t necessarily look the part of a franchise anchor. But he remains one in every sense of the word.Jokić’s offensive brilliance is infectious. He’s arguably the greatest passing big of all time, averaging seven assists per game in each of the last two seasons. But it’s not necessarily the assist volume that sets Jokić apart. He dishes dimes from every conceivable angle, throwing looping passes to cutters and lasers to perimeter shooters. There’s a skittishness evident with defenses that play against Jokić. Take a step toward the paint, and an open three will be generated. Stay put on the perimeter, and Jokić is ready to punish a defender on the low block. Jokic isn’t just unselfish. He’s downright gleeful to feed his teammates. It’s hard to imagine a better superstar alongside Jamal Murray in Denver.Denver’s resident behemoth is more than just a transcendent passer. He’s evolved into a punishing presence at the rim, averaging a healthy 1.06 points per possession on postups and 1.03 points per possession as a roll man in 2019–20. Jokić can catch the ball in traffic and put it on the floor. He’s a gifted interior passer, and his midrange jumper is more refined by the year. Jokić occasionally suffers from what we’ll call Marc Gasol syndrome. He’ll pass up open triples in search of feeding his teammates, though that unselfishness can occasionally be counterproductive. Jokić isn’t a knock-down shooter, but his reticence appears to be hampering his percentages to a degree. Few players in the NBA sport better instincts on the floor. Jokic should be unafraid to let it fly. The more command of the offense he takes, the better. —M.S.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated7. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles LakersWhile LeBron James was the unquestioned No. 1 on the Lakers, Anthony Davis was the key to unlocking the team’s success. His versatility, particularly on the defensive end on the floor, essentially served as a cheat code for the Lakers’ coaching staff. Frank Vogel could play big, small, shooters, non-shooters. Seemingly none of it mattered because Davis’s game largely covered up for any perceived deficiencies elsewhere in the lineup. AD will be a bonafide Defensive Player of the Year candidate for many seasons to come. He shifted between power forward and center in 2020, and he was the ultimate eraser for the Lakers. Vogel could cook up aggressive schemes because Davis served as the ultimate backline defender, punishing those who dared to challenge him in the paint. The Lakers rarely relied on switching, and their stay-at-home mentality banked on the fact Davis could roam and wreak havoc when necessary. AD could also guard perimeter stars, like he did when he matched up with Jimmy Butler in the Finals, or Kawhi Leonard during the regular season. Only two or three players in the world right now are as impactful as Davis when he’s locked in on the defensive end, and frankly that skill alone makes him an incredibly valuable player.But of course, there’s the offensive component. James recently told SI the Lakers thought Davis was hardly breaking a sweat at times when putting up monster numbers. AD’s game is effortless on the surface, but the devil is in the details, particularly his footwork. He can abuse more lumbering bigs with turnarounds, jab steps, and quick bursts. He can bully smaller defenders on the block. He looked like Dirk Nowitzki at times with his midrange jumper during the postseason. And Davis also has the ability to stretch his game out to the three-point line, though he’s so effective from the elbow down it almost seems unfair when he’s also connecting from distance. Like many greats, Davis is obsessed with constantly adding flourishes to his game. He’s only 27 years old, which means the contract extension he recently inked will carry him through the smack dab of his prime. The players above Davis on this list have either been the No. 1 guy on a championship team or won MVP (or both.) The odds are AD will join that club sooner rather than later. — R.NWendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports6. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets All signs would seem to indicate that we’re getting something close to the full Durant experience this season. He’s far enough removed from his torn Achilles that expectations are running high. There’s certainly some hope built into this ranking, but we’re talking about one of the greatest scorers in league history, and a player whose size, skill and pure shooting ability give him a chance to age more than gracefully as he plays out his remaining prime years in Brooklyn. Durant is one of maybe a handful of players who are true threats to score the ball no matter where they stand on the floor nor how you choose to defend them. He’s always been able to simply shoot over you when he wants to, and he makes those shots most of the time. The magic lies in the consistency and inevitability of those points, particularly when games matter most. His decision to join the Warriors will always be controversial, but the results he got in Golden State should not be. Now, Durant’s time with the Nets—the third phase of his career—may prove to be the most complicated test he’s faced.So, what’s next? Durant has said he’ll spend time at center this season. Brooklyn’s apparent willingness to experiment, and his apparent lack of minutes restriction, bodes well for the state of his body. The truth is that he’s always transcended positions, because he’s seven feet tall and is probably going to score on whoever’s defending him. But the thought of him working more as a screener and the focal point of a five-out offense is certainly intriguing food for thought. As Durant continues to age, the value he brings defensively will continue to diminish. You might also see his playmaking skills and rebounding trend upward as his responsibilities change. Health is a serious caveat, but if we’re simply picking teams for this season, it’s hard to take Durant any lower than this. If he truly returns to form, this placement will look a little conservative. —J.W.Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Stephen Curry, Golden State WarriorsFor some reason, there’s a section of NBA fans who want to shovel dirt on Stephen Curry. They think he needs to prove something this upcoming season, that he has to show he can still be a superstar-level player without Klay Thompson or Kevin Durant by his side. It’s blasphemous. Curry remains one of the most electric players in the NBA, and his shooting ability endures as one of the most impactful forces in league history.Curry played in only five games last season, but there’s no reason to believe he’s not fully recovered from the broken hand that caused him to miss most of the year. If anything, the long layoff should help Curry, whose body could have likely could have used a break after five straight Finals trips. Critics will point to Golden State’s early struggles in the first post-Durant year as evidence that Curry can’t be a traditional No. 1 guy. That strain of thought completely ignores the context of last year’s Warriors roster, which was hastily reassembled after Thompson’s ACL tear and Durant’s departure. Just because Curry doesn’t have the build, look, or style of a typical perimeter star doesn’t mean he’s any less effective. His gravity alone on the offensive side of the ball completely changes the calculus of any defense. For as great as players like LeBron, KD, or Kawhi are, when have you ever seen an opponent try to slow them down with a box-and-one? Curry is obviously a killer with the ball in his hands because he’s a threat to pull up at any moment, but his off-ball work—his cutting, screening, and constant motion—is just as beautiful to watch. Few stars of his caliber are committed to that style of play. And the attention he draws when he sets a proper screen makes life immeasurably easier for his teammates. Curry could score 15 points in a game and still be the reason for an elite offensive performance because of everything he does for his team. And for all the concerns about his defense, he continues to compensate for his relative lack of size by being in the right place at the right time and an engaged team defender. At 32, Curry may very well be nearing the end of his prime. Still, shooting often ages gracefully. And with all the chatter about his status as a No. 1 perhaps serving as extra motivation, Curry should be primed for at least one more great season. — R.N4. James Harden, Houston RocketsStrip away the aesthetic debate and a simple truth emerges regarding James Harden. Houston’s leading man is arguably the greatest scorer of the century, and at this point in his career, Harden remains a walking playoff berth. The 2017–18 MVP enters this season with 11 straight postseason appearances and three straight scoring titles, posting one of the most impressive scoring resumes in league history. Just three players have tallied more 40-point games. Harden could pass Kobe Bryant for the third-most 50-point performances this season, and he has a good shot of passing Michael Jordan for the No. 2 spot in the coming seasons. Harden does benefit from obscene volume, but can you really blame Houston for tailoring its offense to the Harden show? The past eight years have represented arguably the best stretch in franchise history thanks to Harden’s brilliance.It’s not necessarily the scoring totals that makes the Harden experience so jarring. It’s the way he’s completely warped defenses in recent seasons. His dominant step-back has forced opponents to shade their coverage to a hilarious degree, placing defenders firmly on his left hip to prevent the game’s most unstoppable move. When one defender fails, defenses opt for a new strategy entirely. The 2019–20 season brought the emergence of the Harden trap, in which teams would double-team Harden before he even stepped past half-court. Harden has a legitimate statistical case as the greatest scorer of this century. But the way he’s defended may be the greatest testament to his greatness. Just as Michael Jordan required his own unique coverage decades ago, opponents fully embraced the Harden Rules to a shocking degree in 2019–20.Harden’s offensive brilliance will earn him a bust in Springfield and potentially a statue in Houston when all is said and done. But will the Harden experience be remembered as much for its frustrations as its brilliance? Harden remains an imperfect player despite it all. He’s often unwilling to make any impact without the ball in his hands, far too content to rest with his hands on his hips in the half-court. Harden’s postseason failures have been noted ad nauseum, and while there is some context necessary, it’s hard to shake the feeling that there is a gear missing with the season on the line. Harden disappeared in a 2017 exit against San Antonio. He couldn’t stop the stream of missed triples vs. Golden State in 2018, and he was outdueled by Steph Curry down the stretch one year later. Perhaps Harden’s struggles are exacerbated by his unique style. Perhaps the talent around him is to blame. Regardless, Harden’s contention window in Houston appears to have come to a close. We’ll see if he can reverse his career narrative in a new location sooner than later. —M.S.3. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles ClippersOn any given night, Kawhi Leonard can be the best basketball player in the universe. Though his first year with the Clippers ultimately ended in massive disappointment, Leonard showed numerous times throughout 2020 why some had moved him ahead of LeBron before the season. Kawhi is a steely assassin, an expert at getting to his spots when he needs a bucket. He’s at his most enjoyable to watch when he puts teams away by himself, going on these mini flurries at the ends of halves, forcing opponents into submission with his unstoppable elbow jumper. Leonard is a master at playing on his schedule. He can lull you into a false sense of confidence because at first glance his style of play is not overwhelming. But once he finds a weakness to exploit, he is ruthless in his execution.With the Clips, Kawhi improved on the campaign that landed him a Finals MVP in Toronto. He averaged a career-best 27.1 points per game, shooting a robust 47% from the field and 37.8% from three. The defense remains suffocating when he wants it to be, even if Kawhi isn’t a pure stopper as he was early in his career. (Nobody with that much of an offensive burden really is.) Leonard also made great strides as a playmaker, recording a career-high 4.9 assists a night. Playing without a great point guard for really the first time in his career, the Clippers asked Leonard to be more of a ball-handler in 2020, and he acquitted himself well as a passer when drawing extra defenders. That added element to his game made the Clips really deadly when they had their full complement of players, as Kawhi was adept at finding his numerous shooters when needed. (If anything, the Clippers’ early playoff exit showed that Leonard could afford to be even more aggressive. Perhaps it’s not his preference, but he’s more than capable of running constant pick-and-rolls to exploit matchups.)Ultimately, there’s a reason why Leonard, before the age of 30, has gotten the best of guys like Durant, Steph, LeBron, and Giannis in the playoffs—it’s because he’s really damn good. All the players listed there have also had disappointing playoff losses, by the way. Don’t let what happened in the bubble convince you that Leonard isn’t still on the level of the elite of the elite. — R.NGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks There’s no shame here in Giannis ceding the top spot on our list, and it may not take much for him to reclaim it. He offers more on a nightly basis than any player in the league. He’s a seven-foot-tall athletic marvel, and his ballyhooed quest to make the Finals cannot be held against him in an exercise like this. There may not be a player in the league, from stars to scrubs, who pours as much of himself into a given game than Antetokounmpo. Using his length, explosiveness and intelligence, he dominates the interior, he breeds transition offense, he finds teammates, and he wins games. There are games where his jumper doesn’t fall — the only true critique of his game at age 26 — but Antetokounmpo doesn’t take nights off. It is noteworthy that those shooting woes tend to manifest in the playoffs, when opponents wall off the paint and take their chances. The consecutive, unceremonious exits are blots on his ledger. But there is also room for improvement, and in the context of a player who so genuinely cares about being great, we should be optimistic that the jumper will come. (Plus, he’s pretty damn effective without it).Antetokounmpo continues to improve each year, launching those threes more often than ever before, getting to the foul line more, rebounding better and making even more of his minutes, all while shouldering a league-high 37.5% usage rate in 2019–20. After all, this is the two-time reigning MVP and the Defensive Player of the Year. Where many of the league’s stars have plateaued in their 20s, Antetokounmpo continues to add wrinkles to his game. It will only continue to slow down for him. His production is the NBA’s most valuable constant. He comes in second here, only because arguably the greatest player in league history has yet to slow down in any meaningful way. So this is where we leave Giannis, as more 1B than true No. 2. —J.W.John W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated1. LeBron James, Los Angeles LakersIt’s been 18 years of LeBron James, and we are spoiled. The King has now spent nearly half of his entire life in the NBA. He has little left to prove in terms of individual accolades or statistics. His sheer longevity speaks for itself. And after piloting the Lakers to a title, adjusting his game yet again to make it happen, he regains the top spot in this ranking after briefly ceding it a year ago. The mind-boggling amount of mileage on his body weighs on your mind, the half-step he’s lost athletically crops up time and again, and James can’t just flip the switch quite the way he used to. He requires maintenance and rest. He’ll take plays off defensively and weeks off mentally. At this point, these are things we have to simply accept. The meaty LeBron discourse can be picked clean from any angle. It can be exhausting. His case as the No. 1 player in an exercise like this no longer feels or reads as an absolute truth. Yet it remains the logical answer, knowing all that we know about who he is when the challenge boils down to winning or losing a game.As last season reminded us, in any contest with stakes, there’s not another player you’d take ahead of James. He’s the best player on the planet when he wants to be. And when things matter, that’s always going to be what he wants. The Lakers are favorites to repeat for that reason. LeBron led the NBA in assists for the first time as a 35-year-old, and it didn’t happen by accident. That vision and wherewithal isn’t going to be what fails him. James still finds ways to swing the outcome of games in unexpected fashion. When there are great players around him, he doesn’t simply fit with them—he takes their play to another level. While still giving full credit to Anthony Davis, everyone knows that his on-court life has never been easier, with James on the floor to dictate where the ball should be, to draw defenses, and maximize the quality and ease of his shot attempts. The Lakers’ championship doesn’t happen without that level of synergy. It all still revolves around LeBron, in a way no other player can replicate. He’s proven that it will not be his brain or his skills that lead to his decline. It’s a different brand of dominance now, but the impact and the weight of his influence remain unmatched when things count. It’s all about the end result.How much longer James will hold the top spot is anyone’s guess, and going into this season, there are plenty of comers. But it feels certain that this is not the time to take it from him. And that’s where we’ve landed. —J.W.GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five?

Making big impacts. Let’s take a look at the top 50 so far:Note: The article was originally written by Jarrod Castillo, since updated by the Sportsnaut team.Consistency has obviously been an issue for the 20-year-old Edwards since Minnesota made him the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Despite this, the flashes this Georgia product has shown thus far in his career makes him a top-50 NBA player. The kid is averaging nearly 22 points per game as a sophomore and has seen both his effective field goal and three-point percentages increase a ton since his rookie campaign.The other half of the vaunted “Splash Bros.,” Thompson just returned to action after a two-year hiatus. While he’s been limited in minutes as the Warriors look to get him up to speed, we have not seen too much of a drop-off in production. The three-time champion is averaging 18 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists. He’s also shooting 36.1% from distance while continuing to play elite-level defense. We’re intrigued to see how Thompson looks once he’s playing his full 38 minutes per game (27.9 thus far).Acquired from Sacramento during February’s NBA trade deadline, Haliburton is among the best young point guards in the NBA. In limited action with the Pacers, he’s averaging 17.2 points to go with 9.5 assists while shooting 41% from three-point range. Having recently turned 22, he’s still not close to his prime. The sky is almost literally the limit for the Iowa State product.Related: NBA schedule and fantasy basketball picksA first-round pick of the Nets back in 2017, Allen displayed flashes of brilliance in Brooklyn before heading to Cleveland in the James Harden trade to open the 2020-21 season. Since joining the Cavaliers, he’s been an elite force for this up-and-coming squad. That includes Allen averaging 16.1 points and 10.8 rebounds on 67.7% shooting. He also ranks eighth in the NBA this season in win shares. That’s insane.One of the more surprising success stories from last season was Jerami Grant having a fantastic performance for the rebuilding Detroit Pistons. He very nearly nabbed the Most Improved Player award last season averaging career-highs in points, assists, and free throw percentage. While injuries have impacted Grant this season, he’s still one of the better two-way players in the game.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA Playoff and title predictions One of the most-underrated acquisitions during the 2020 offseason, Christian Wood proved to be a godsend for a Rockets team that will have to continue finding an identity moving forward. Wood had a tremendous breakout season last year and has since carried over that success into this season. He’s averaging 18.1 points and 10.1 rebounds. The question now is whether Wood fits in long-term with the Rockets after months of trade speculation.It was about this time last year that Collin Sexton was seen as the face of a rebuilding Cavaliers squad. Boy, how a calendar year changes things. Cleveland is a legit playoff contender back east and one of the most-surprising squads in the game. For his part, Garland just earned his first-ever All-Star appearance. For good reason. The former No. 5 pick from Vanderbilt is averaging career-highs in points, rebounds, assists, steals, field goal percentage and effective field goal percentage. Did we mention he’s only 22?In the latter half of last season, Miles Bridges began to show signs that he was ready to have a breakout year coming into this season. In his last 19 games of the year, he averaged 20.3 points shooting 52% from the field and 6.8 rebounds. Thus far this season, Bridges is averaging 19.9 points, 7 rebounds and 3.9 assists on 48.7% shooting this season.Pretty much the centerpiece in the trade that sent Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers ahead of the 2019-20 season, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has morphed into a star and leader for the rebuilding Thunder. It’s pretty darn shocking what we’ve seen him do thus far in OKC. Since the start of the 2020-21 season, SGA is averaging 24.2 points, 4.9 rebounds and 5.9 assists.Related: NBA MVP rankings for 2022 It’s going to be interesting to see how Simmons pans out in Brooklyn after the blockbuster trade from Philadelphia. He’s fallen down our list of the best NBA players big time after sitting out the entire season with the 76ers and following a disastrous playoff performance in 2020-21. Even then, we’re talking about one of the best defensive players in the game and a dude who can contribute big time. You don’t average 15.9 points, 8.1 rebounds and 7.7 assists on 56% shooting over four seasons without being pretty good.De’Aaron Fox has proven himself to be among the best NBA players at the point guard position. That’s magnified by the fact Fox has improved in each of his four seasons. Unfortunately, the Sacramento Kings have not been in the postseason since 2006. With Fox’s numbers taking a big dip through 74 games and the Kings falling to 13th in the West, their chances of making it back to the playoffs are not likely.After a season in which he was named the NBA’s Most Improved Player leading to a well-deserved contract extension, Randle has seen his production decline big time. It led to some rumors heading into February’s NBA trade deadline. Since then, the forward has picked it up. Randle is averaging 24.4 points, 10.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists since the start of February. He’s coming around.While all of the buzz surrounding the New Orleans Pelicans is based around Zion Williamson, not enough is said about the player that Brandon Ingram has developed into. Ingram signed a max contract extension ahead of the 2020-21 campaign, Ingram is now continuing to play at a high level. So far this year, he is averaging 22.8 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists. With Williamson still sidelined to a knee injury, Ingram has taken over as the face of the franchise in NOLA.Ayton, 23, has morphed into one of the more reliable centers in the NBA. He’s doing so for a championship-contending Suns squad. Since the start of last season, he’s averaging 17.3 points and 10.1 rebounds on an otherworldly 64.6% shooting. The question now is whether Phoenix will award him with a max contract as a restricted free agent during the summer.The Milwaukee Bucks took a massive gamble in their blockbuster trade for Jrue Holiday. In the end, it paid off in droves for the Bucks as Holiday played a huge role in the team winning the NBA championship over the Phoenix Suns. Holiday gets a lot of respect around the league as one of the best perimeter defenders in the game today with even Kevin Durant praising his talents on JJ Redick’s podcast. His impact continues to be felt for Milwaukee as they are legit contenders to repeat in 2021-22.Former Defensive Player of the Year Draymond Green may not get much recognition due in part to him not being a prolific scorer, but he is arguably one of the best playmaking bigs the NBA has to offer. He helped the Warriors to a hot start to the 2021-22 season before going down to a back injury. Put it this way. Golden State is 29-9 in the 38 games Green has played in this season. It’s a mere 19-16 when he sits.Since given the opportunity to be the full-time starter in Toronto, Pascal Siakam has shown that he is among the best power forwards in the league today. However, a torn labrum suffered late last season prevented him making a major impact early during the 2021-22 campaign. Boy, has Siakam turned it around since. He’s averaging 22 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.1 assists on 48.8% shooting this season.A former No. 1 pick, the 26-year-old Towns has lived up to his end of the bargain on the offensive end. He’s having the best overall performance of his career this season, averaging 24.7 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.7 assists. He’s also shooting 40.7% from distance while ranking fifth in offensive win shares. That seems pretty good.In highly unfortunate fashion, Jamal Murray went down to a torn ACL 48 games into the 2020-21 season. That came after the 2019-20 NBA Playoff hero averaged 21.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.8 assists 41% from three-point range. Unfortunately for him and the Denver Nuggets, there is no timetable for his return depriving fans from seeing his and the team’s development.Related: 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year rankingsA throwback to bigs of the past, Nikola Vucevic has been slowly expanding his offensive game and it is paying dividends for a Chicago Bulls team that is on a fast rise to contention in the Eastern Conference. Vucevic has not truly been able to leave his mark on the Bulls so far this year though he is averaging a double-double with 18 points and 11.3 rebounds. He will get his chance to make more of an impact for Chicago moving forward.It’s not that Murray wasn’t a good player earlier in his career with San Antonio. Rather, it’s all about him taking his game to the next level since being the primary focus on offense. With DeMar DeRozan in Chicago, Murray has excelled in a lead role. He’s averaging 20.9 points to go with 8.3 rebounds and 9.3 assists while leading the league in steals at 2 per game. Murray ranks 19th in the NBA in defensive win shares and 10th in value over replacement. He’s a first-time All-Star. You do the math.Coming off a season in which he became the first Charlotte Hornet to win the Rookie of the Year since Emeka Okafor in 2005, Lamelo Ball has not become a victim of the sophomore slump so far. He is averaging 19.8 points, 7.3 assists and 6.8 rebounds. We’re talking about a first-time All-Star who is still only 20 years old. There’s a ton of untapped potential here.While Khris Middleton gets a bad reputation for being inconsistent, he is arguably one of the most underrated players in the NBA. After an eight-game absence due to health and safety protocols, Middleton has finally started to find his footing for the Bucks this season. For the season, he is averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists. Though, Middleton’s shooting numbers are down from the previous six seasons. That has to be seen as concerning.An amazing defensive player, the “Stifle Tower” has shown that he can stop almost anyone at the rim. Gobert’s offense needs work if he is to stay on the court against smaller, faster teams. But as long as he plays his role, he’ll be fine. After a second straight playoff loss with the Utah Jazz, there’s some concern over Gobert’s relationship with star teammate Donovan Mitchell. It will be interesting to watch if Utah is booted from the postseason prematurely once again.Acquired by Sacramento in the blockbuster Tyrese Haliburton trade, Sabonis remains one of the most-skilled bigs in the game. The two-time All-Star is averaging 19.2 points, 12.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists since the start of the 2019-20 campaign. Unfortunately, issues on defense keep Sabonis limited on our list of best NBA players right now.Probably the best ball-handler of all-time, Kyrie Irving’s mastery with a basketball is undeniable. He can score 50 on any given night and drop any defender that’s in front of him. He’ll be able to resume playing home games soon with New York’s COVID-19 mandates changing but has only suited up in 20 outings this season. When Irving is dialed in, he’s as dominant as they come.The 28-year-old Anthony Davis has been a two-way presence since being the first pick back in 2012. Davis has been criticized for not living up to expectations of being one of the top-10 players in the NBA. While his numbers don’t look bad on the surface averaging 23.1 points on 53.7% shooting, he’s now an injury-plagued enigma and has struggled to remain healthy consistently.Jaylen Brown has teamed up with Jayson Tatum to form an elite young wing duo in Boston. The former No. 3 pick has proven former GM Danny Ainge right in refusing to include him in trades for the likes of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the past. After some struggles earlier this season, Brown has picked it up recently. He’s averaging 23.2 points and 6.0 rebounds on 46.6% shooting. Brown also remains a legitimate two-way threat, as his defense continues to improve on an annual basis.No longer just a dunker, LaVine has improved in almost every other facet of his game from his shooting averages to his per-game totals. Only 26, LaVine has a lot of time to improve other facets of his game to become one of the better all-around players in the NBA. In a year that could see him make the playoffs for the first time in his eight-year career, Lavine is flourishing averaging 24.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 4.7 assists.Related: Ranking 2021-22 NBA defensesSpeaking of max contract extensions, Bam Adebayo re-upped with the Heat as his talents continue to flourish in South Beach. Coming off a season in which the Miami Heat being bounced in the first round of the playoffs, they could be primed for a second NBA Finals in three years with a now revamped roster. Despite missing games to injury earlier this season, Bam has returned to be his dominant self.Since coming into the league in 2017, Mitchell has proven to be a fast-rising star in the NBA. The 25-year-old is a nightly 20-4-4 threat and even as the focal point in the offense, his percentages have stayed consistent in his three years in the league. If he’s able to keep producing, it’s not out of the equation that Mitchell will become a top-10 player.Maybe one of the best offensive players in NBA history, Harden has shown that he can lead a team as the No. 1 option on that end of the court. However, the aforementioned rule changes for “foul hunting” seem to have affected his performance. Now that Harden has joined Joel Embiid in Philadelphia, the hope is that he’s going to return to form. Time will tell on that front, but he looked sharp in his debut.Each year, Jayson Tatum continues to get better and better the more he plays the role of the number one option on offense for the Boston Celtics. The competition in the Eastern Conference is thicker than it’s been in a long time. Tatum is doing his very best to put Boston in strong playoff standing, averaging 27 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists.No doubt one of the best clutch shot makers in recent history, the 31-year-old Damian Lillard definitely knows what time it is when it comes to the game clock. It’s “Dame Time.” Sadly, Lillard is likely lost for the remainder of the season to injury and saw his production decrease before being sidelined. He was averaging six-year lows in PPG, RPG and APG while shooting just 32% from distance. At 31, have we seen the best from Dame already?Even without a three-point shot, the 32-year-old Demar DeRozan has found a way to stay effective. An excellent mid-range shooter, he improved his rebounding and passing pretty much every season. Now a member of the Chicago Bulls after a blockbuster sign-and-trade, DeRozan has played a major role in the team being a contender in the Eastern Conference going forward currently leading the team in scoring with 27.6 points on 50.5% shooting. He also ranks 10th in win shares and seventh in offensive win shares. That’s enough for DeRozan to jump way up the board in our most-recent best NBA players list.After leading the Memphis Grizzlies to their first postseason since 2017, Ja Morant looks to take his team to the next level with a fantastic effort again this season. He is averaging 27.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists. He also has Memphis with the second-best record in the Association at 50-23.One of the few truly elite two-way players in the league, George is a terror on both ends of the court. He can drop 20-25 points on a nightly basis while also shutting down the opposing team’s best player. George earned a lot of people’s respect in the playoffs last season nearly leading the Clippers to the NBA Finals despite being without Kawhi Leonard for a large majority of Los Angeles’. Unfortunately, George currently joins Leonard in being sidelined to injury.The 32-year-old Butler seems to have finally found a home in Miami. Butler has embraced the Heat’s winning culture with great success thus far and that could lead be amplified this year as the Heat have a new and improved team thanks to a wealth of new additions. Butler has helped his team remain a top threat, posting 21.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.7 steals with the Heat in sole possession of first place in the East.Arguably the most surprising team to start the season has been the Washington Wizards opening up the year with a 5-1 record. A huge reason for the teams’ success was the play of their dynamic guard Bradley Beal. Unfortunately, Beal is now lost for the remainder of the season with his future in D.C. firmly up in the air.Stardom. That’s what we saw from the 24-year-old Devin Booker during Phoenix’s shocking run to the NBA Finals last season. Booker is looking to build on what was a spectacular postseason with the difference this year being he will be the hunted not the hunter. Thus far for the star two-guard and Co., that has been the case. Booker has led this squad to an NBA-best 59-14 record. He’s also averaging north of 25 points per game while shooting 37.5% from distance.Related: Sportsnaut’s updated NBA power rankings Chris Paul demonstrated that he still has gas left in the tank during an absolutely brilliant 2020-21 regular season for the Phoenix Suns. Paul is one of the best leaders the NBA has today and that was on full display during the Suns’ playoff run last season. As his career winds down, Paul will look to get Phoenix back to the promised land capturing the NBA championship that has eluded him. He has been a huge catalyst for the Suns success this season, ranking ninth in the NBA in win shares and sixth in defensive plus-minus.As we saw in the playoffs last year, Trae Young is shaping up to be the next shooter with limitless range. Trae is making a name for himself as not only a great shooter but one of the brightest stars in the league today. Not only that, but he is surrounded by an excellent supporting cast that allow him to flex his amazing playmaking skills. While things have not gone the best for the Hawks this season, Young’s earned another All-Star appearance and is a legit star out there.At only 22, Doncic is doing things for the Dallas Mavericks that haven’t been done since LeBron James. Since the start of his sophomore campaign, Doncic is averaging 28.2 points, 8.8 rebounds and 8.7 assists. He’s earned three consecutive All-Star appearances and is a downright dominant force on offense. This dude has Hall of Fame written all over him.Last season, Kawhi Leonard was a huge catalyst in the Los Angeles Clippers reaching their first Conference Finals in franchise history during last season’s playoffs.  Unfortunately, he was unable to reap the benefits of all his hard work as he was injured during the semifinal round forced to miss the rest of the playoffs due to a partially torn ACL. That news is bad enough but it could be even worse as it could force him to miss the entire 2021-2022 season. Hopefully this is not the case and we are able to see him back on the court prior to the start of the 2022 playoffs.Despite the Nets also having stars such as Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons, Kevin Durant proves he is among the best of the best every time he steps out on the court. Sadly, his season has been derailed by a sprained MCL in his knee that has caused the future Hall of Famer to miss 27 games. How important is KD to the Nets? They are 8-19 in those 27 games. Brooklyn is 30-16 when Durant plays.LeBron James has been accused of being selfish because he has clearly found the fountain of youth but will not let his peers know where it is. He is now 37 years old and continues to show he has many, many years left in his career. LBJ has two 50-point games in his last nine contests in which he’s averaged 35.6 PPG and is showing no signs of slowing down any time soon.The often-injured Joel Embiid is now among the best NBA players in the game right now. That’s not hyperbole. We’re talking about the most-dominant big man since Dwight Howard was in his prime. Embiid has 25 30-point games since mid-December.Last season, Stephen Curry put up what might have been the best individual season of his career but it was not enough to lift the Golden State Warriors into the playoffs. This year, the Warriors have returned Klay Thompson from injury and continue to give Steph a strong supporting cast. Despite some recent struggles, the two-time NBA MVP is still averaging 25.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 6.3 assists on 38% shooting from distance. He’s also improved a whole heck of a lot on defense.A good argument could be made that reigning MVP Nikola Jokic has solidified himself as the best big man in the NBA today. The three-time All-Star is only 27 but is already making a name for himself as the most dynamic center the NBA has ever seen. He can easily put up 20-10 with seven assists as the focal point of the Nuggets’ offense. Jokic’s production has not stopped as he is averaging some ridiculous numbers in 2021-22 (26.2 PPG, 13.6 RPG, 8.0 APG).After an incredible performance in the 2021 NBA Finals, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to their first championship in 50 years, Giannis Antetokounmpo has shown no signs of letting off the gas during the 2021-2022 NBA season. He’s just as consistent and dominating as they come. Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, he’s averaging 28.3 points, 11.7 rebounds and 5.6 assists on 55% shooting. Yes, he’s the top NBA player right now and is still just 27 years old. Let that sink in.Share:  Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2020-21 season?\n",
      "A new season means new player rankings.As always, this is a collaborative effort, with eight members of our NBA.com Global Staff submitting their list of who they believe are the 30-best players heading into the 2020-21 season. We then used a point system to come up with the following list.The last time we did this was after the Los Angeles Lakers were crowned champions of the 2019-20 season. Not much has changed since then thanks to a shorter-than-normal offseason, but that doesn't mean our ranking isn't different, because we've included Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving this time, three top-30 players who didn't crack our last list due to season-ending injuries.The only notable player not included this time: Klay Thompson, who is expected to miss the entire 2020-21 season with a torn Achilles.With all that in mind, onto the list. \n",

Who's in first place?By Agustin StellaDecember 16, 2020 03:27PM EDT December 16, 2020 03:27PM EDTBy Agustin StellaThe National Basketball Association features only the best teams on earth, filled with world-class players and competitiveness. But what also makes this sport so popular are the diehard and loyal fans, those who stay with their franchises through thick and thin.Needless to say, some teams are easier to root for than others, as they've been used to performing at a high level and dominating the rest of the league. That's why today, based on the numbers shown on Facebook, we made this ranking of the 25 teams with most fans in the NBA.Fans: 1.8 million City: Detroit, MI Championships: 3 Founded: 1941 (as Fort Wayne Zollner Pistons)The Pistons were not always located in Detroit. In fact, the team was founded in 1941 as the Fort Wayne (Zollner) Pistons, in Indiana. As a member of the National Basketball League, it won two NBL championships, and in 1948 joined Basketball Association of America.In 1949, the Pistons became parted of the NBA, the merged league, and it wasn’t until 1957 that the franchise moved to Detroit. The team is a member of the NBA’s Eastern Conference Central Division and plays its home games at the Little Caesars Arena.Fans: 1.8 million City: Memphis, TN Championships: 0 Founded: 1995 (as Vancouver Grizzlies)The team was originally founded as the Vancouver Grizzlies and joined the NBA in the 1995/1996 season as an expansion team. It wasn’t after the 2000/2001 concluded that the Grizzlies moved to Memphis to become the NBA’s Western Conference Southwest Division team we know today.An interesting thing about the Grizzlies is that they are the only team in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the city of Memphis and the only professional basketball team in the state of Tennessee.Fans: 1.8 million City: Salt Lake City, UT Championships: 0 Founded: 1974 (as New Orleans Jazz)The team was founded in 1974 as the New Orleans Jazz, as a tribute to New Orleans’ history of originating jazz music. Five years later, the team moved to Salt Lake City, and has been playing its home games at Vivint Smart Home Arena since 1991.During the late 1980’s, the Jazz had one of the most famed point guard-power forward duos in NBA history with John Stockton and Karl Malone, led by coach Jerry Sloan. They reached two NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, but they lost both of them against Michael Jordan’s Chicago Bulls.Fans: 1.8 million City: Milwaukee, WI Championships: 1 Founded: 1968The Bucks were founded as an expansion team in 1968 and former US Senator Herb Kohl was their long-time owner until 2016, when a group led by billionaire hedge fund managers Wes Edens and Marc Lasry agreed to purchase a majority interest in the team from Kohl.Since its foundation, the team has featured many notable players such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Oscar Robertson and Ray Allen, among others. Today, Giannis Antetokounmpo is the big star of the team and one of the most talented players in the NBA.Fans: 1.9 million City: Phoenix, AZ Championships: 0 Founded: 1968The Suns joined the NBA in the 1968/1969 season and were the first major professional sports franchise in the Phoenix market and the entire state of Arizona. The team plays its home games at the Talking Stick Resort Arena.Charles Barkley and Steve Nash won the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award while playing for the team, becoming two of the most well-known stars in the history of the team.Fans: 1.9 million City: Minneapolis, MN Championships: 0 Founded: 1989The Wolves struggled in their early years after their foundation in 1989, but with the acquisition of Kevin Garnet, the team became more competitive.

The Bulls led in the second-most states with eight.There were only seven current NBA players who led jersey sales in a state: James, Damian Lillard, Donovan Mitchell, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Trae Young and Jayson Tatum.But some of states that don‘t house a pro basketball franchise purchased some very random jerseys this season.Yao Ming led sales in Montana, far from Houston, where he spent the entirety of his NBA career. Additionally, the Charlotte Hornets then led Montana for team jersey sales. One of the weirdest jersey sale leaders, though, is Mike Bibby in Alabama. Bibby played for six different squads and retired in 2011. So it’s unclear why are Alabamans purchasing his jersey at such a high rate.Surprisingly, the only state that the late Kobe Bryant led for jersey sales was Alaska. Otherwise, retired players led in 14 states. Michael Jordan led in three states (Illinois, Delaware and South Dakota) to be the retired player with the most jersey states led.More NBA Coverage: GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five?

But, who has been the best NBA player of 2022? Which NBA players do you love to watch in 2022? When it comes to the best active player in the NBA today, LeBron James and Stephen Curry, two of the most iconic and celebrated players to ever compete, deserve to be high up in the rankings, but a number of other challengers for the title—such as the defending champion Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks and the reigning MVP Nikola Jokic. Not to mention Kevin Durant and Luka Doncic!Who's the best player in the NBA in 2022? Vote up your favorite basketball stars, and re-rank this list the way you think it should look!Top 100 NBA Players of 2019The Crossover is proud to offer our list of the Top 100 NBA players of 2019, an exhaustive exercise that seeks to define who will be the league's best players in the 2018-19 season.Given the wide variety of candidates involved and the deep analytical resources available, no single, definitive criterion was used to form this list. Instead, rankings were assigned based on a fluid combination of subjective assessment and objective data. This list is an attempt to evaluate each player in a vacuum, independent of his current team context as much as possible. A player's prospects beyond the 2018-19 season did not play a part in the ranking process.Injuries and injury risks are an inevitable component of this judgment. Past performance (postseason included) weighed heavily in our assessment, with a skew toward the recent. First-year players were not included. A predictive element also came into play with the anticipated improvement of certain younger players, as well as the possible decline of aging veterans. Salary was not taken into consideration. Otherwise, players were ordered based on their complete games. You can read more here on the limitations of this kind of ranking. To see our 25 biggest snubs from this year, click here.Please feel free to look back to SI.com’s Top 100 Players of 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014. A special thanks, as always, to those resources that make researching a list like this possible: Basketball-Reference, NBA.com, ESPN.com, Cleaning the Glass, and Synergy Sports.Ball (10.2 PPG, 6.9 RPG, 7.2 APG) was the league’s easiest target last season: He faced significant pressure as the No. 2 pick, he faced extra scrutiny on a high-profile franchise that had one eye on LeBron James, he faced derision for his unsightly jumper and fading confidence, and he faced second-hand disdain thanks to the ramblings of his infamous father and his immature brother. “Baptism by Fire” would be an appropriate name for a documentary about his first season, which began with Patrick Beverley eating him for dinner and ended with knee problems that ultimately required summer surgery.At his best, the 20-year-old Ball plays a beautiful weirdo brand of hoops that would merit a full chapter if “Free Darko” ever released a sequel. His passing and vision—hailed as elite by pre-draft analysts—lived up to the hype. He proved to be a capable pace-setter and a strong rebounder for his position. Most impressively, he was a plus defender right out of the gate thanks to his good size and instincts. On paper, Ball’s role in James’s new cast is intriguing. A successful blueprint would utilize him as a secondary passer and off-ball cutter, rather than as a full-time lead guard launching misguided threes in volume. Although Ball is hardly a textbook modern backcourt prospect, the dawn of “LeBronzo” promises to carry his distinctive game to new heights. — BGJust because the Lakers had no use for Lopez (13.0 PPG, 4.0 RPG) doesn’t mean the same is true for other teams. It’s not hard to find room for a seven-footer who can score inside and out, and most important: one who doesn’t need much preamble to set up his scoring opportunities. Posting up Lopez is an option, but far from the only one. You could set him up for rolls to the rim or rely on his cuts to complement other offense. Or, if you prefer, you can station him outside to open up the lane. Lopez isn’t a lights-out three-point shooter, though last season he converted the same percentage of his threes (34.5%) as Marc Gasol, Anthony Davis, and Blake Griffin—all bigs with some light stretch to their games.All told, Lopez still scored 20 points per 36 minutes for a team that had no incentive to play him or rely on him in any way. That will be different in Milwaukee, as it would be on any number of teams looking to actually win games this season. Lopez’s defense is clearly imperfect, though he at least has the benefit of sheer size; it’s hard to clear the ball over a center with that kind of reach, even if he runs into trouble defending in space. — RMAge may have restricted how and when Gasol can be of help, but coaches tend to find a place for those who understand the symphony of the game. Gasol (10.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 3.1 APG) is more than the collection of his skills and liabilities; his enduring value comes in knowing what opportunities might materialize, and having the presence of mind to assist in their creation. Any offense that moves would benefit from dropping Gasol in the middle of it all, where he presents a scoring threat even as he connects the dots for his teammates.The cost comes in mobility—both in a literal sense and a tactical one. On his best days, the 38-year-old Gasol navigates the floor at a brisk shuffle. Switching isn’t an option. Longer rotations can be a challenge. San Antonio managed a top-five defense in spite of this, but Gasol would present much greater problems for many lesser teams. His, like many in this range, is a borderline case. What value Gasol still has depends on how effectively a team manages the narrowing limits of his game. — RMStan Van Gundy bet the house on Jackson (14.6 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 5.3 APG) and lost. In 2015, the longtime coach targeted the stubborn, capable point guard as the centerpiece of a win-now spending spree aimed at fast-tracking the Pistons back to the postseason. The plan worked momentarily, as Jackson turned in a career year en route to the 2016 playoffs. But Jackson’s spotty health plunged Detroit back into the lottery in 2017 and 2018, and Van Gundy was fired in May. The final stats on the Jackson/Van Gundy marriage: $80 million, one playoff trip, zero playoff wins, two season-altering injuries, numerous post-game rants, and one desperate Blake Griffin trade that will likely clog Detroit’s books for years to come.While Jackson, 28, is a bit of a forgotten man at this point, it’s worth noting that Detroit played at a 49-win place last season with him in the lineup. To piece his reputation back together, Jackson will need to prove that he can still get to the rim consistently, shoot the three far better than he did in 2017-18, and stay healthy for a full season. With Griffin and Andre Drummond now capable of handling some of the playmaking load, Detroit can make the playoffs without Jackson turning back the clock to his 2016 form. Expecting Jackson to be a franchise point guard was always asking too much, but he has enough talent and experience to be recast effectively in a smaller role if he’s willing. — BGTo understand how Nowitzki clings to this list past his 40th birthday, one need only watch how defenses regard him. Every screen he sets has an adhesive effect; those defenders involved know that their first priority is to slow the progress of the ball handler, but to do so requires that they reluctantly peel away from Nowitzki (12.0 PPG, 5.7 RPG). There is more than reputation at work. Just last season, Nowitzki rated as one of the better spot-up shooters in the league, per Synergy Sports—more efficient, shot for shot, than even Klay Thompson and J.J. Redick. Opponents won’t dare leave Dirk because they know just how punishing his open looks can be.Nearly everything else in Nowitzki’s game has faded with time. One can practically hear his creaking joints when he tries to back down some younger, springier center, and there is no disguising his slow-motion coverage of the pick-and-roll. It speaks volumes, however, that a walking—err, lumbering?—target like Nowitzki still works out to be a helpful contributor in so many lineups. There is something to be said for standard bearing and institutional knowledge, but even more when those things come from a low-turnover, sweet-shooting big who is more than willing to accept a lesser role. Dirk’s value to an organization has aged more gracefully than his footspeed. — RMLet’s credit Carroll (13.5 PPG, 6.6 RPG, 2.0 APG) with genuine nobility. Remember, it wasn’t so long ago that the 32-year-old forward was leaving Toronto as a huge disappointment due to an exorbitant four-year, $60 million contract, a debilitating knee injury and a pair of meek postseasons. After he was salary-dumped to the dead-end Nets, Carroll could have counted his money and jogged through a losing campaign. Instead, he responded to the trying circumstances with purposeful 3-and-D play. In addition to posting career-highs in points, rebounds and assists, Carroll regained his footing on the defensive end, ranking No. 64 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus.With better health, Carroll has largely returned to the form he displayed for the 2015 Hawks. On offense, he subsists on catch-and-shoot threes and cuts to the basket. On defense, he rotates through multiple perimeter positions and rates well on hustle stats like deflections and recovered loose balls thanks to his high-activity style. If Carroll can keep things rolling to open 2018-19, he should generate healthy interest from playoff teams at the trade deadline or during buyout season. — BGIt’s no exaggeration to say that VanVleet (8.6 PPG, 2.4 RPG, 3.2 APG) was an impact stats god last year. The 24-year-old Raptors guard, who finished third in 2018 Sixth Man of the Year voting, was off the charts in virtually every lineup configuration. When he played with his fellow young reserves, who led the NBA among bench groups in net rating, Toronto was +17.1. When he joined a veteran-heavy and starters-dominated group as a floor-spacing third guard, Toronto was +24.9. Remarkably, VanVleet ranked No. 28 in the NBA in Real Plus-Minus and in the top 100 by both Win Shares and WARP. All this for an undersized, undrafted player who has yet to record a single start in two seasons.The magnitude of VanVleet’s success in a limited role naturally raises some questions. How well would his contributions hold up if he was forced to play more than 20 minutes a night? How would he fare if he was asked to lead a less-talented bench group? How well would his game translate to the playoffs? The early returns on that last question were not pretty. As he worked back from an untimely shoulder injury, VanVleet couldn’t recapture his dependable three-point stroke and wasn’t about to single-handedly solve Toronto’s annual problems with composure and defense. The Raptors’ ugly ending poured some cold water on their much-hyped bench play, but it didn’t erase VanVleet’s substantial progress. The sweep against Cleveland didn’t kill VanVleet’s earning power either, as he cashed in with a well-deserved two-year, $18 million contract in July. — BGOlynyk shoots just well enough from the perimeter to earn a close-out, which is exactly the point. The shot itself is a setup; helpful as it is that Olynyk can take and make threes, his funky, off-kilter drives are the true underpinning of his game.Each of his forays into traffic is an improbable enterprise. Olynyk (11.5 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.7 APG) is about as far from the driving prototype as NBA players come; he isn’t especially quick, or explosive, or creative with the ball. His running form most closely resembles that of a giraffe. Yet when given room to navigate, Olynyk has a knack for sliding between defenders, coursing into the paint for layups of all kinds. Miami played its best basketball last season with Olynyk on the floor, in large part because those ball skills matter. When a big can create space and capitalize when called upon, they allow more possessions to follow through to their natural conclusion. — RMThinking for too long about Fournier (17.8 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 2.9 APG) in Orlando can lead to intense feelings of sympathy and hopelessness. The 25-year-old guard is a proven shooter and cheeky ball-handler who is stuck in a constant struggle to score enough points to offset his porous defense, all while playing for an organization that doesn’t offer much in the way of supporting talent or structure. His 2017-18 campaign marked a career year in scoring and efficiency, but it ended prematurely due to injury and didn’t improve the Magic’s playoff prospects in the slightest. If a relatively anonymous Frenchman goes for 22 in a loss in front of a listless crowd, does he make a sound?Although Fournier appears to be a lost cause on defense due to his lack of physicality and questionable will, he’s filled out his offensive repertoire nicely. After four years with the Magic, he’s a trustworthy catch-and-shoot option from the wing, he understands how to relocate into space to find a quality look, he’s shifty coming around screens and splitting defenders, and he’s developed some off-legged floaters and runners to catch bigs by surprise. Although his sizeable contract makes it difficult to construct viable trade scenarios, it’s easy to envision him thriving in an Eric Gordon-like role for a playoff team that needs instant offense off the bench. As is, the Magic are asking too much of him offensively and he’s not asking enough from himself defensively. — BGBazemore (12.9 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.5 APG) is the NBA’s anti-Forrest Gump: He has an uncanny knack for always just missing out on the action. The 29-year-old guard, who went undrafted in 2012, arrived on the scene with the Warriors just before Stephen Curry and Co. rocketed to dynasty mode. He then had a brief cup of coffee with the Lakers in 2014, a period of deep irrelevance after the ill-fated Dwight Howard experiment but before Kobe Bryant’s farewell tour. From there he landed in Atlanta, where he played a bit role on a team that made the 2015 East finals before finally breaking out in a starting role just as the team’s core was disbanded.Thanks to the four-year, $70 million contract he inked during the 2016 cap spike, Bazemore has gone from toiling in the G-League to becoming the highest-paid player on one of the league’s worst rosters in less than five years. Although he’s clearly overpaid and unequipped to be a playoff team’s best, second-best or third-best player, Bazemore is a solid 3-and-D wing with good size and motor. In an ideal world, he would be cast as a fifth option in a contender’s starting lineup and asked to space the court, pick his spots to attack off the dribble, and bring energy on the defensive end. If Trae Young grows quickly into stardom, Bazemore will be a handy complementary piece. If not, he’ll continue to be grist for the trade rumor mill. — BGThe closest Orlando came to competence last season was in Vucevic’s time on the floor. So continued a four-year run of inflated usage, in which the seven-footer was overstretched and miscast as a primary offensive option. No playoff team would use Vucevic (16.5 PPG, 9.2 RPG, 3.4 APG) in this way, but the Magic—even after five straight years in the lottery—are short on viable alternatives. Vucevic’s steady, accessible scoring is welcome on a team with so many stalled possessions.Extricating Vucevic’s broader value from those circumstances is challenging, though one can safely assume he would be better served by doing less. Just because Vucevic can score a bit from everywhere (including beyond the arc, in a recent development) doesn’t mean he should try to quite so often; for Vucevic to attempt about as many shots per minute as LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Giannis Antetokounmpo is a monumental stretch. Were he on a remotely functional team with amenities like floor spacing and playmaking, Vucevic could slot into a healthier role as a supporting scorer and dependable rebounder. — RMMurray (8.1 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 2.9 APG) is the NBA equivalent of a writing whiz who aces the verbal section of the SAT with ease but gives up and guesses “C” on all the math questions. By virtually every defensive metric, the second-year guard is phenomenal. At 21, he earned All-Defensive Second Team honors by placing in the top 10 in Defensive Real Plus-Minus, Defensive Rating, and steal percentage while playing for the NBA’s fourth-ranked defense. Murray is a prototypical backcourt stopper in both physique and psychology: long, quick, aware, irritating, diligent, and fully committed to the glass.By virtually every offensive metric, though, Murray is a borderline mess. He’s been an incompetent and unwilling shooter at the NBA level, and he is regularly neglected and dared to shoot. Unlike many guards who struggle from beyond the arc, he hasn’t yet perfected a compensatory weapon like a step-in mid-range jumper or an in-between floater. While Murray is generally unselfish and a willing passer, he’s not adept enough in the two-man game to function as a lead distributor. In sum, the Spurs’ offense was generally better when the ball was in someone else’s hands. With Kawhi Leonard, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, and Kyle Anderson all departing this summer, the man dubbed “Baby Boy” as a Seattle-area prep star must grow up in a hurry. — BG“Slo Mo” might not be the best nickname in pro sports, but it’s certainly the most accurate. Anderson (7.9 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 2.7 APG) is deliberate in virtually everything he does, whether it’s pushing the ball in transition, executing a frame-by-frame Eurostep, or acclimating to life in the NBA. Although it took four seasons and Kawhi Leonard’s extended absence for Anderson to break through as a full-time starter, he acquitted himself very nicely once he got there. The 24-year-old forward posted career-highs across the board last season, and his efficient play and all-around contributions landed him in the top 75 by Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP. Seeking a value play to make up for the Chandler Parsons debacle, Memphis poached Anderson with a four-year, $37 million contract in July.Anderson’s biggest weakness—poor outside shooting—is a critical one, but he has developed workarounds: He has a strong understanding of team spacing, he stays active off the ball, he moves hard into passes to launch unexpected attacks on the paint, he sprays drive-and-kick passes to all corners and he has a quirky and well-honed array of turnarounds, floaters and runners. San Antonio’s recent actions suggest, however, that they perceived a hard ceiling to his utility given his floor-cramping nature and limited raw athleticism. The Spurs sharply cut his minutes when facing the Warriors in the playoffs, and then decided not to match the Grizzlies’ offer even though they had a major hole on the wing. For Anderson, Memphis represents a fresh start, a larger role, and a chance to prove that his subtle and nuanced style can translate outside San Antonio’s structured environment. — BGSteve Kerr delivered a fitting postscript to Golden State’s grueling seven-game triumph over Houston in the West finals: “We would have won the series in five if Iggy played.” That assessment spoke to the importance of the Warriors’ prized sixth man, but also to the precarious position the defending champs face when he’s not on the court. Indeed, the 34-year-old Iguodala (6 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 3.3 APG) has arguably become the biggest potential pothole on the road to a fourth title in five years. Last season, he continued to show clear signs of aging by posting career-lows in minutes and points, missing 18 regular-season games and six crucial playoff games, and failing to display must trust in his three-point shot.Nevertheless, the Warriors remain virtually unbeatable when their full “Hamptons 5” lineup is assembled, going 19-3 combined in the last two postseasons. During the 2018 playoffs, they posted a 123.7 offensive rating and a staggering +24.8 net rating, as Iguodala’s excellent feel, commitment to the pass, precise defense, and opportunistic shot-making continued to make him an ideal fifth option. While there’s no question that Iguodala’s reputation and body would suffer if he played for a weaker team, aspiring contenders like Houston, Boston and Philadelphia would all kill to have a second-unit wing with his intelligence, experience and unselfish approach. — BGFor a player as active as Johnson (10.8 PPG, 4.9 RPG, 3.8 APG), a sports hernia—the injury he nursed through much of last season—can prove quite taxing. So much of Johnson’s game is anchored in how he moves; it’s his ability to change speeds and directions that makes him so dynamic on offense, and it’s the ease with which he slides laterally that brings value to a defense. If Johnson’s all-around play seemed a bit flat last season, that’s because it was—down to his every step.Offseason surgery hints at a return to form. Competing in the modern NBA all but demands a player like Johnson—a big who can capably switch, handle, pass, and shoot. Some of those skills are less reliable than others in Johnson’s case, though their intersection alone makes him valuable. You live with his wilder swings because of all that his versatility unlocks. The means to beat the trap, to trigger the break, to control matchups, and to move a guard off the ball are all there for Johnson, provided he’s healthy and focused. — RMFormer Rockets wing Shane Battier was famously dubbed the “No-Stats All-Star” for his vital defense and glue-guy game; Tucker (6.1 PPG, 5.6 RPG) is his pudgier heir apparent in Houston. By traditional individual measures, the 33-year-old forward was an afterthought, ranking outside the NBA’s top 300 in PER while placing seventh on the Rockets in points and sixth in touches. But the impact stats told a much different story: Tucker improved the Rockets’ efficiency on offense and defense during the regular season and the playoffs, he boasted a stellar +10.8 net rating, and he ranked No. 87 league-wide in Real Plus-Minus. By February, he had forced his way into the starting lineup, holding that spot throughout the Rockets’ run to the West finals. Not bad for roughly $8 million per year.Tucker, like Battier before him, has carved his niche through pure feistiness. Although he is listed at just 6’6”, he was regularly deployed as a center when coach Mike D’Antoni sought to maximize his lineup’s spacing and switchability. To compensate for his lack of length and shot-blocking ability, Tucker consistently forced opponents to work hard for post position, contested rebounds with abandon, and delivered hard fouls as needed. True to his tough-minded reputation, the former second-round pick also led the Rockets in drawn charges and recovered loose balls. While Tucker might never claim glory like James Harden and Chris Paul, he surely possesses his superstar teammates’ gratitude. — BGAs Ben Simmons, Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum bucked the norm by playing leading roles on teams that advanced in the playoffs, Markkanen (15.2 PPG, 7.5 RPG) lived a more conventional experience for a lottery pick. The 21-year-old Finnish forward endured months of losing and tanking with the Bulls, he struggled to adjust to his defensive responsibilities, and he missed 14 games due, in part, to minor back injuries. Despite those hurdles, Markkanen was an easy All-Rookie First Team selection because he proved to be a legit marksman with a quick, natural release and range that extended multiple steps beyond the arc. Indeed, the 7-footer drilled 145 threes last season, the most in NBA history by a rookie taller than 6’9”.As the season progressed, his signature pick-and-pop game was supplemented by fake-and-drive action that allowed him to use his length to finish in one-on-one scenarios. While not yet much of a playmaker, Markkanen can handle well enough to locate pull-up shots or get going downhill. On the defensive end, he switched and hit the boards better than expected, but he still ranked outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus due to strength limitations and awareness issues. Markkanen is reportedly adding weight in anticipation of playing more center, a tough ask given that he had the lowest block rate among 7-footers who logged at least 2,000 minutes in 2017-18. The good news is that he projects as such a potent offensive weapon that he only needs to become a passable defender to emerge as the face of Chicago’s youth movement. — BGCoaches tend to lean on Gibson (12.2 PPG, 7.1 RPG) because he makes their lives easier. It’s a relief to have one player on the court who always knows what’s going on, both in the conceptual sense of what a team hopes to accomplish and within the second-to-second frenzy of an NBA game. Don’t underestimate the power of that stability. Nothing about the way Gibson plays basketball is especially modern, but there is a timeless advantage in reliable execution.Gibson has made a career of it. There is never a question of whether he’s game to compete, ready for the moment, or adequately prepared. Some matchups suit Gibson better than others, but that’s just life as a role player. You make do. Smart positional defense will at least keep Gibson in the mix, allowing the rest of his game to pop for opportunistic value. He isn’t an elite rebounder, though Gibson often comes up with the board that matters. His game might not accommodate bulk scoring, but Gibson, who just turned 33, is coming off the most productive and efficient scoring season of his career. He’s a few rungs removed from the league’s truly elite defenders, but Gibson might well come up with the stops to save your season. — RMFew players enhanced their reputations during the 2018 playoffs as much as Rozier (11.3 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.9 APG), who stepped in for the injured Kyrie Irving and guided the Celtics to within one game of the Finals. There were two keys driving the 24-year-old guard’s postseason success. First, a supreme self-confidence. Despite never starting in his first two seasons and being known primarily as a defensive pest, Rozier sent Milwaukee packing from the first round, nailed seven threes in Game 1 against Philadelphia to set the tone in the conference semis, and held tough when LeBron James cranked it up in the East finals. Rather than freeze on the big stage, he tormented Eric Bledsoe, carried himself like a star on the postgame podium, and donned “Scary Terry” t-shirts bearing his own likeness on off days. This was a textbook case of being ready—physically and psychologically—when called upon.The second element of Rozier’s success was easy to miss amid the swagger and hoopla: He played with exceptional control, posting a 5:1 assist-to-turnover ratio in the postseason. While Rozier suffered bouts of streakiness and famously ran cold in Game 7 against the Cavaliers, his careful stewardship throughout the playoffs was crucial to Boston’s efforts to muster enough scoring and to prevail in close games. Going forward, Rozier is an obvious trade chip: He’s equipped to become a full-time starter because he’s trustworthy with the ball, he’s improved his three-point shot, he’s tenacious on defense, and he’s gotten a good taste of the limelight. — BGAminu (9.3 PPG, 7.6 RPG) is the elastic band that holds a top-10 defense together. If you prefer a conservative defensive style—as the Blazers do—then Aminu can muck up passing lanes and slow down top-scoring forwards. If you’d rather rely on switching, he’ll float from opponent to opponent without missing a beat. At the same time, Aminu would look right at home blitzing and recovering against the pick-and-roll, where his length makes a chore of even the most basic outlet pass. One can be a specialist and still have a highly transferable skill set.Of course, not every team is equipped to score around (and at times, in spite of) a marginal threat like Aminu. Every dribble he takes tends to get him deeper into trouble; a lack of practical ball skills leaves Aminu with little recourse in the face of real defensive pressure. Average three-point shooting and offensive rebounding offer some means to contribute, though many of his best looks tend to come by design. Relative to the alternatives, Aminu’s streaky jumper is the kind of attempt a defense can stomach. — RMSchröder’s 2017-18 season was a cry for structure. The only thing standing in the way of his using possessions like a superstar was common sense—a luxury, as it turns out, reserved for teams with better alternatives than Atlanta. Absent those, Schröder did as he pleased.The results were predictably fruitless. Schröder (19.4 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 6.2 APG) put up some of the emptiest numbers in the league last season, considering how little they did for Atlanta’s bottom line. This is emblematic of larger concerns. We know Schröder can beat his man off the dribble and score, but can he bring an offense to balance? Does his passing make his teammates better? Can his length and quickness translate to real defensive benefit? The jury is still out, even within the league. It means something that Schröder is capable of producing at this level, though that “something” varies wildly depending on case and circumstance. — RMAll Sabonis needed was room to play his game. The Thunder didn’t have it; after drafting Sabonis in 2017, Oklahoma City parked him out on the perimeter and grew frustrated when he struggled. A change of scenery jump-started his career. With a trade to the Pacers came gentler expectations – the kind that allow a 22-year-old to try and to fail and to find himself. Sabonis (11.6 PPG, 7.7 RPG, 2.0 APG) was allowed to played to his strengths and develop in his own time.The entire demeanor of Sabonis’s game changed. Gone was the petrified rookie, replaced instead by an intuitive scorer and playmaker. Making decisions off the pick-and-roll and working out of the post gave Sabonis his bearings. These were spaces he knew how to navigate, full of reads he had encountered before. An easy chemistry formed between Sabonis and Victor Oladipo. The Pacers came to rely on him, so much so that Sabonis became the pressure release when Indiana’s guards ran into traps in the postseason. Sabonis isn’t perfect (concern over his lackluster defense is perfectly valid), but the feel he’s shown suggests he’s an uncommon talent. — RMOnce the most fearsome shot-blocker in the league and an ideal smallball center for postseason matchup purposes, Ibaka (12.6 PPG, 6.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG) has skidded into an identity crisis. At the root of Ibaka’s troubles is major slippage on the defensive end: Toronto’s defensive rating was better without him last season, and his block rate was less than half of his peak levels during his early-20s. Remarkably, Jonas Valanciunas and Jakob Poeltl both defended more shots within six feet and allowed a lower percentage on those shots than did Ibaka, whose three straight All-Defensive First Team selections already seem like a distant memory.\n",
      "The 2018 playoffs weren’t kind to him either. When Ibaka, 28, was acquired in 2017, he was seen as the piece to help push Toronto over the top and as a rim-protecting linchpin of switchable smallball lineups that could slow down LeBron James. Instead, he largely no-showed in the embarrassing second-round sweep against Cleveland, struggling badly in Game 2 and getting benched in Game 3. At this point, Ibaka is essentially a replacement-level starter whose primary offensive value derives from his three-point shooting because his once-impressive finishing has tapered off. His career arc sadly mirrors that of his former team, the Thunder: He rose to prominence years before everyone expected and then crumbled years before everyone wanted. — BGIt’s easy to bag on Ariza considering how his season ended, but one bad shooting night doesn’t undo all that came before. Ariza (11.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG) was one of the most important players to one of the NBA’s best teams. In the Western Conference finals alone, he was Houston’s best chance of challenging Kevin Durant—a counter to Golden State’s reluctant isolations. Throughout the year, it was Ariza’s defense that gave the Rockets their elasticity. Tucker may have been the point of differentiation from big lineups to small ones, but Ariza was the constant between them.The Rockets will miss him, and Ariza them. Scoring comes easily when James Harden and Chris Paul do so much of the thinking for you. Some 82% of Ariza’s field goals—and damn near all his threes—were assisted last season. His best work comes as a beneficiary, making it difficult to assess his value in a vacuum. Houston barely needed Ariza to dribble, much less create. Most other teams—Phoenix included—would be exposed to a different level of risk. Never underestimate the superstar safety net. — RMYoung (11.8 PPG, 6.3 RPG) lives and works in the background, which seems to suit him just fine. His defense is a quiet sort—the kind predicated on denying position and making timely rotations. When Indiana’s opponents bail out midway through a set play, Young is often the unstated reason why. It’s subtle, but opportunities have a way of vanishing when Young runs interference, assuming that they materialize at all.Young is the defender who phases out Kevin Love, pushing LeBron James to the brink of a first-round elimination. The integrity of Indiana’s entire system hinges on Young’s ability to cover ground. You don’t have to switch pick-and-rolls when a player like Young can cover the gaps. His steal rate was the highest among bigs precisely because he understands how to play the space between show and recover. You won’t get much more than random, opportunistic scoring out of Young, but his court sense brings an added functionality to so many of his team’s pursuits. The Pacers may have been the best story of last season and Young, impressively, their second-best player. — RMEven though Magic Johnson scooped up virtually every available wild card in free agency, the Lakers’ biggest X-factor remains Ingram (16.1 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 3.9 APG). The 2016 No. 2 pick made clear strides in his second season, emerging as a full-time starter, ratcheting up his scoring and efficiency, improving as a finisher, and becoming more comfortable and less predictable with the ball in his hands. At times, Ingram brought to life the pre-draft projections that he would be a perennial All-Star wing: he displayed the handle and shake necessary to create good shots, he attacked the basket more assertively, and he deployed his spindly length to find seams through the defense and exploit size mismatches.The surest way for the new-look Lakers to make noise in the playoffs would be for Ingram to establish himself as a reliable No. 2 scoring option and a plus defender. To get there, he must continue to extend his range, engage his attack mode with greater consistency, and play more disruptively on the defensive end. He also needs better health, as he was sidelined for a quarter of L.A.’s 2017-18 season. LeBron James’s arrival, of course, should make his life easier: Ingram will face more favorable defensive matchups, receive cleaner catch-and-shoot looks, and play within a more structured and explosive style. After two seasons getting his bearings, it’s time for Ingram’s training wheels to come off for good. — BG  While Wiggins (17.7 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) has been guilty of playing some of the NBA’s emptiest minutes, he sure does play a lot of them. Indeed, the 2014 No. 1 overall pick has logged a league-leading 11,841 minutes and missed just one game over the last four years. Instead of using that tremendous developmental opportunity as a ramp to superstardom, the 23-year-old wing has sputtered. The major advanced stats agree that his max rookie extension and his reputation as a high-flying scorer both far exceed his on-court value, as he ranked outside the top 200 in PER and Win Shares, outside the top 300 in Real Plus-Minus, and outside the top 500 in WARP.As each season passes, Wiggins’s lack of follow-through becomes more aggravating. He’s attempting more threes, but he hasn’t yet established himself as a knockdown shooter. He has the body and athletic tools to be a premier defender, but his awareness lags and he’s often passive. He can sky for posters, but he shrinks on the glass. He’s been surrounded by better teammates over the last two seasons, but he hasn’t made meaningful strides as a playmaker. He appeared primed to improve his scoring efficiency as a complementary option to Jimmy Butler, but he settled into wallflower mode instead. Taken together, these burgeoning concerns beg the question: Is Wiggins, the Ironman, also a Tin Man? — BGSo often, the idea of Batum—a lanky, playmaking wing—is more appealing than the reality. You might think of Batum as a strong defender, but his investment on that end comes and goes. One night he might rise to the challenge of guarding an All-Star, and on another he might go through the motions without putting up much resistance. Batum’s shot looks nice, but he’s made just 34% of his threes over the past three years. What promise he offers as a ball-handler is undercut by the fact that he doesn’t get to the rim or draw fouls. (Batum 11.6 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 5.5 APG) may be regarded as a scorer, but last season he barely scraped into double digits while posting an Evan Turnerian true shooting percentage (52.1%).Injury might provide more of a qualifier if not for the larger trends involved. On some level, Batum was surely less comfortable after undergoing surgery on his left elbow last October. His slide, however, extends back through multiple seasons. No one can dispute Batum’s bonafides as a facilitator, though over the last few years he’s become increasingly reliant on that area of his game—less a swiss army knife than a corkscrew. — RMAmid an unspectacular Lakers season, Randle did something notable: He tempered his game. There’s still a battering ram quality to how he plays, though every drive is more pointed than before. Young players have a hard time showing restraint without sacrificing physicality. Randle (16.1 PPG, 8.0 RPG, 2.6 APG) has managed to tightrope the line between them—not without the occasional misstep, but to the point of becoming an altogether more trustworthy player. Randle’s coaches and teammates no longer have to worry about him veering wildly out of control. Concern, instead, is reserved for the opponent.There’s nothing fun about standing ground against a player this strong, particularly when he has eyes for the rim. Randle can bully his way through other bigs, some traditional centers included, and has the ball skills necessary to create new angles for himself. Batten down the hatches and Randle can simply reroute. Randle will show his age at times (he defends very much like a 23-year-old), though often in ways that hint at what could be. For a third straight year, Randle ramped up his production and efficiency through less-than-ideal circumstances. What might he accomplish for a franchise more invested in his progress? — RMAn incomplete list of things that, for an NBA player, would be easier than scoring on Richardson: Moving a washer/dryer up three flights of stairs; eating a Carolina Reaper; reaching fluency in Mandarin; perfecting hummingbird pose; performing the third movement of Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata”; making soufflé that doesn’t collapse; fending off a swarm of bees; beating Hollow Knight to completion; renovating a four-bedroom house by hand; and running a marathon … in crocs. His defense makes even the simplest parts of basketball into something arduous.No matter where you go on the floor or how you choose to operate, Richardson (12.9 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.9 APG) will be all over you, bodying up and swiping at every turn. Many defenders could manage that for minutes at a time, but what separates Richardson is his endurance. You may tire out, but he never seems to—even as his usage on offense steadily increases. It’s amazing how far Richardson’s offense has come during his three years he in the league. He started out, as many second round picks do, just trying to hit open shots and avoid making mistakes. Now he actually helps the Heat run offense. Richardson did well in his first season in a more operative role and only stands to get better. The arc of a player’s development isn’t determined by age, but by how long they’ve been working in some particular capacity. — RMOrganized basketball is a desperate grasp for control, but sometimes teams are better off leaning into the chaos. Barton (15.7 PPG, 5.0 RPG, 4.1 APG) is a conduit for it—a scorer with a bottomless capacity for surprise. Just when you think you know what Barton might do, he takes the opposite pivot, spins off in a different direction, and converts the kind of shot other players would never think to attempt. The scouting report on Barton is to throw out the scouting report.Barton’s ability—which is considerable—is exceeded by his daring. Gambits like his run the risk of backfire, but they also allow good teams to stretch beyond themselves. A little shake goes a long way. The clearest sign of Barton’s maturation is his understanding of when to let loose. His is the bargain a team can live with. There was never any question of who was better for the Nuggets last season between Barton and the safer Wilson Chandler. One fills minutes capably and predictably. The other actually makes things happen. — RMLike a July 4th cookout or a family trip to the waterpark, a change of address for Howard (16.6 PPG, 12.5 RPG, 1.6 BPG) has become a rite of summer. The eight-time All-Star center has landed in Washington via Charlotte and Brooklyn, continuing a cycle of new GMs dumping him as quickly as possible and desperate GMs talking themselves into a gamble that will almost certainly backfire.The 32-year-old Howard is far removed from his prime years and probably leads the league in worn-out welcomes, but his reputation shouldn’t completely eclipse his performance. Last season, he missed just one game, he made Charlotte better both offensively and defensively when he was on the court, and he was one of only five NBA players to average 12 points and 12 rebounds. While Howard’s defensive impact, mobility and effort have atrophied—thereby limiting his utility in the postseason—he still ranked among the league’s most productive rebounders and finished 70% of his shots in the basket area. It’s too late for the former No. 1 pick to become the player and teammate everyone has hoped for, but he remains a worthy option as a starting center. — BGCousins (25.2 PPG, 12.9 RPG, 1.6 BPG) should be regarded as the NBA’s biggest “What if” of 2018. If the two-time All-NBA center hadn’t blown his Achilles, do the Pelicans still take off down the stretch? Or, do their Twin Towers push the Warriors even harder in the playoffs? Come summertime, does he re-sign in New Orleans on a max deal? Or wind up as the superstar sidekick that LeBron James never found in LA? Or take DeAndre Jordan’s place with the Mavericks? Or become the new face of the Bulls? Remarkably, the actual fallout from Cousins’s injury trumped all those alternate histories: He signed a one-year bargain deal with Golden State, becoming the fifth All-Star in the champs’ projected starting lineup and inciting angry responses from 29 competing fan bases.Stepping back from the injury-induced whirlwind, it’s worth noting that Cousins’s year-plus stint in New Orleans didn’t provide definitive answers to the major questions that dogged him in Sacramento. Nine seasons in, he still hasn’t played in a playoff game. His raw stats—on par with prime Shaquille O’Neal—haven’t translated to elite team performance. And, at 28, he is still plagued by emotional outbursts and ejections. Nevertheless, Cousins was correct when he called his summer signing a “chess move,” as the Warriors can slow-play his rehabilitation, lighten his load, and afford to hold him to a higher personal standard.If healthy, Cousins would have placed in the top 25, but SI’s Top 100 is a one-year exercise, and this ranking assumes Cousins will miss roughly half the season, play reduced minutes upon his return, and perform at roughly 60% of his capabilities due to his age and the serious nature of his injury. — BGIndiana is still waiting on Turner. To date, the 22-year-old has been a tantalizing but only moderately effective NBA player. The shooting he brings to a lineup is nice, though Turner (12.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG) has yet to graduate from pick-and-pop specialty. He has the presence to protect the rim, if not the expertise to guarantee it; too often he’s positioned a half-step removed from where he should be or stuck a half-second behind the action, as is so common for bigs of his age and experience level. So many of the necessary skills are there. Any delay, then, comes from learning how to best apply them.This ranking is a balance. Turner has the profile of a player who could take a big step this season but still faces a burden of proof in pulling it all together. Development is rarely linear. There will be fits and starts, breakthroughs and frustrations. Maybe last season could have gone differently for Turner if he weren’t dealing with an elbow injury or gradually recovering from a concussion. All we know for certain is what we saw: another decent season with some marginal improvement and all the hallmarks of a player still finding his place in the league. — RMWhy wait until he retires? The NBA should invite Gordon (17.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG, 2.3 APG) to speak at the annual rookie symposium right now, as the 2014 lottery pick can already attest to the good, the bad and the ugly of professional basketball. Gordon, 22, is about to play for his fifth coach in five seasons. He’s endured four seasons with 35 or fewer wins and multiple core-altering trades. He’s deployed a hoverboard and a drone in a pair of memorable Slam Dunk Contest appearances. He’s been played out of position and seen his name listed in possible trade scenarios in a leaked photo of his front office’s whiteboard. And Rob Hennigan, the GM who drafted Gordon, spent years on the hot seat before he was finally fired.Aside from his evident explosiveness, defensive versatility and good-natured disposition, Gordon still presents more questions than answers. He’s best suited to playing the four and has ramped up his perimeter shooting, but he’s not yet consistent enough to be a true stretch option. He has the agility and motor to be a plus defender, but he’s not a traditional rim-protecting presence and is better suited to life outside the paint. Most of all, he’s emerged as a higher-volume scorer, but he’s done so with below-par efficiency on a team that hasn’t played meaningful games after Thanksgiving. On the bright side, Gordon has a new four-year, $80 million contract to show for his hard knocks, a pact that will keep analysts guessing about his value until Orlando finally finds a path back to relevance. — BG    Harris (18.6 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 2.4 APG) has played for four teams in seven seasons, but he’s developed into far more than a journeyman as he’s entered his prime. In fact, the combo forward’s inclusion in a midseason trade for Blake Griffin provided an excellent opportunity to appreciate his potent and flexible offensive game. While Griffin is more imposing, more decorated and far more famous, Harris plugged seamlessly into the Clippers’ starting lineup at less than half of Griffin’s price. L.A. went 17-15 after the trade, as Harris displayed improved perimeter shooting and the ability to score without hijacking the offense.Like many stretch fours, the 26-year-old Harris often finds himself in mismatches defensively, as he lacks length and lateral quickness. He’s made some progress in terms of awareness on that end, though, and his growth as an off-the-dribble threat helps offset his defensive deficiencies. Although under-qualified to be an alpha scorer due to his limited playmaking for others, Harris would add value to any team hoping to modernize its offense. Unlike Griffin, he’s an easy piece to fit. — BGAlthough Nurkic (14.3 PPG, 9 RPG, 1.4 BPG) just completed his rookie deal, he has rewritten virtually every aspect of his scouting profile. During two-plus seasons in Denver, the Bosnian 7-footer couldn’t finish, couldn’t protect the ball, couldn’t handle big minutes, couldn’t stay healthy, couldn’t serve as a functional backline defender, and couldn’t get along with his coach. Following a 2017 trade, the Blazers embarked on an “Extreme Makeover: Starting Center” mission, encouraging Nurkic to trim down, communicating his role to him clearly, empowering him to pursue his own offense, and entrusting him with major defensive responsibilities.Nurkic, 24, responded in a big way in 2017-18, playing in 79 games and logging more than 2,000 minutes, well above his previous career-highs. He wasn’t just eating up minutes: Nurkic helped Portland improve from No. 21 to No. 8 in defensive rating, he dramatically increased his FG% around the basket, he cut his turnover rate, and he learned to swallow his pride when pulled for match-up purposes in late-game situations. All that progress didn’t help him avoid being torched by Anthony Davis in the playoffs, but it did earn him a four-year, $48 million extension this summer. Next up on the to-do list: ease up on the low-percentage runners, floaters and flip shots that drive Blazermaniacs berserk. — BGAs the NBA has plunged deeper into the smallball era, perception of Valanciunas (12.7 PPG, 8.6 RPG) has seesawed wildly. Once viewed as a potential All-Star, the Lithuanian center became a case study for natural selection on the hardwood: What chance did a lumbering 7-footer have of staying on the court during the playoffs? Rather than overhauling his game to become a full-fledged stretch five, Valanciunas has evolved in softer fashion: exerting maximum effort in fewer minutes, seeking out and exploiting undersized defenders for high-percentage scoring opportunities, dabbling with the three ball, and gradually improving his feel and confidence when forced to defend away from the hoop.The result? Valanciunas, 26, proved to be a skilled battering ram in the 2018 playoffs, notching six double-doubles in 10 games, outplaying Washington’s Marcin Gortat in the first round, and pounding the Cavaliers for 21 points and 21 rebounds in Game 1 of the second round. Yes, the Raptors eventually went down in ugly fashion, but Valanciunas was hardly their weakest link. With excellent durability, well-honed post moves and greater comfort in his refashioned role, Valanciunas has managed to stave off stylistic extinction and trade rumors alike. — BGIt makes perfect sense that Redick (17.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 3.0 APG) would leave the most comfortable fit of his NBA career at age 33 and go on to have his best season yet. Philadelphia made Redick a focal point; he might not have led the Sixers in shot attempts or usage, but Redick’s movement without the ball gave the entire offense its shape. Not many shooters could bear the weight of that kind of role. It works for Redick because of how fluidly he transitions from sprint to shot, making some of the hardest shots in the game look easy.Redick could bring that skill set anywhere, modulating his role as necessary to fit whatever his circumstances require. There is an immutable baseline value for a career 42 % three-point shooter who can hold his own defensively. Redick is more than that. The way he takes the ball in a dribble hand-off and reads the next play in sequence opens up the scope of the entire offense. His screens—yes, screens—throw defenders completely out of sorts. It all comes from the versatility of Redick’s form and release, which allow him to touch so many more aspects of an offense than you might expect. — RMWilliams (22.6 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 5.3 APG) was the easy choice for Sixth Man of the Year last season not because he exemplified the award, but because he transcended it. Bench players don’t score more than 20 points per game (Williams is the first to do so in nearly 30 years). They don’t work as a team’s primary scoring option (Williams not only led the Clippers in assist percentage and overall usage, but used roughly as many possessions as Anthony Davis, Victor Oladipo, Donovan Mitchell, and DeMar DeRozan). Yet Williams, miraculously, pulled it off—transforming from a novelty scorer into the leader of a top-10 offense.Let’s give credit where it’s due. Williams may be a crummy, undersized defender, but he’s enough of a dynamo to overcome that. Years of clever play have allowed Williams to craft his own unique style through experimentation. One can find incredible latitude when his primary job is to get buckets, and through it Williams has tested thousands of permutations of fakes and footwork to find what works best for him. The more the league leans toward switching defenses, the more valuable players like Williams—who can dutifully run a pick-and-roll or dance their way through an isolation—become. — RMWas Mirotic (15.6 PPG, 7.4 RPG) the biggest winner of the 2018 trade deadline? One minute, he’s in the hospital thanks to a Bobby Portis punch and dreading a return to the aimless, hapless Bulls. The next, he’s joyriding with the Pelicans’ Anthony Davis in one of the NBA’s most exciting offenses, exploding for 30 points in a playoff game while sweeping the Blazers, and cashing Gillette endorsement checks after shaving his trademark beard. What a glow up.The Pelicans were magical when Davis and Mirotic shared the court, posting a +12 net rating in more than 500 minutes. By comparison, New Orleans was +5.9 in roughly 1,100 minutes with Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. In many ways, Mirotic was the anti-Cousins: He was comfortable playing fast, he was accustomed to life as a complementary option, he rarely turned the ball over, he handled switches, and he moved effectively in space on defense. What’s more, he was strong enough on the boards that New Orleans was able to play its preferred smaller lineups, even in the playoffs. For a winning team, the streaky Mirotic is more than a stereotypical stretch four: He does enough dirty work to justify a major role even when he’s slumping. — BGBarnes (18.9 PPG, 6.1 RPG, 2.0 APG) is not a first-option scorer, as he’s been cast in Dallas, or a fifth option, as he was in Golden State. His game fits neatly in between, where it can funnel some moderate number of possessions toward mildly efficient ends. It’s nice, though, that he can at least dabble on both extremes of the usage spectrum. The strength of Barnes’s game comes through its variety. Not many spot-up shooters would look just as comfortable working in isolation, or curling around a screen, or posting up a mismatch. And while he’s not exceptional enough in any one category to actually give a team some direction, he’s flexible enough to bend in support of those around him.Teams can play Barnes at the three (as seems to be his preference) or the four without much compromise. There is virtually no risk of him getting played off the floor by a mismatch. Small ball and bully ball alike suit him just fine; if anything, Barnes might be even better at stonewalling bigs trying to work their way to the rim than he is shuffling to stay in front of opposing wings. What matters most, though, is that he’s never a target. Featuring Barnes—whether as the lead in an offense or the focus of an opponent’s game plan—will often lead to underwhelming results. — RMTeague (14.2 PPG, 7.0 APG) is good. Not very good. Not elite. Not average. Not bad. The nine-year veteran is a Trader Joe’s prepackaged dinner, a 3.0 grade point average, a starter home, an L.L. Bean backpack, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with no cone or toppings. He satisfies basic needs and rarely excites. In dark days, his thorough competence inspires faint hope. In better times, he inevitably leaves fans wanting more.As his 2017 arrival in Minnesota proved, the 30-year-old Teague is the right point guard to end a 13-year playoff drought and the right point guard to exit meekly in round one. The Timberwolves boasted the NBA’s fourth-best offense last season, as Teague spread the ball around to his star teammates and filled in the gaps with his own scoring when needed. But he hit a familiar hard ceiling in the playoffs, outmatched and, at times, embarrassed by Houston’s premier backcourt. True to form, he received little attention for his role in Minnesota’s best season since 2004; Likewise, his name was nowhere to be found in the rumors of discontent that have engulfed his higher-profile teammates. As it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. “Good” doesn’t make headlines. — BGRubio (13.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG, 5.3 APG) is prone to weeks-long mirages of effective shooting, in which it appears—for some fleeting moment—that his long-range accuracy has turned a corner. The back half of last season was the most prolonged and compelling fantasy yet: 41 games in which Rubio made 41% of his threes, coinciding with Utah playing genuinely dominant basketball. That figure will not hold. But to be fair, it doesn’t have to. Given where Rubio is coming from (31.5% shooting on three-pointers over his first six years in the league), even modest, reliable improvement could be transformative.When you’re already one of the best defenders, passers, and rebounders at your position, a smaller step forward can feel like a stride. There are two factors at work (and thus two parallel reasons to believe in his progress last season): Rubio has now posted a career-high effective field goal percentage in three straight seasons, showing a clear developmental arc; and separately, only now is Rubio playing for a coaching staff that seems to really understand him. You can’t just plug Rubio into any system and hope for the best. Utah gets that, and has found ways to push their point guard without missing the boat on what makes him so valuable in the first place. — RM If you were to ask a basketball coach to describe their ideal role player, they might unknowingly profile Ingles (11.5 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 4.8 APG). Think about it. They’d want someone who’s easy to play with, like a pass-first wing player who also happens to be one of the best three-point shooters in the league. Beyond that, they’d want someone with enough of a handle to initiate some offense and enough vision to make smart plays. Defensive commitment is a given, and the ability to guard multiple positions is a perk. The player would need to be intensely competitive, but it’s best if they’re also unassuming. Coaches would want the kind of player who understands his team’s principles enough to know when to break them—a delicate blend of reliability and creativity.It’s not hard to find more athletic or higher-scoring players. The trick is finding many who are as good as Ingles when it comes to supplying the things that teams actually need. — RM While Murray (16.7 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.4 APG) wasn’t necessarily expected to have an instant impact when he was drafted at age 19, he’s already emerged as a full-time starter and the 2016 class’s leader in games, minutes and points. Now 21, the Canadian product is a prime example of the Stephen Curry Generation: young guards who are encouraged to launch three-pointers at a rate that would have been unimaginable 10 years ago. In his second year, Murray attempted more than five threes per game, a threshold that Curry himself didn’t reach until his fourth season at age 24.Denver’s archer is just getting started. After barely missing the playoffs last year, Murray looks like a strong candidate for 2019 Most Improved Player: His per-game stats and efficiency substantially improved in Year Two, he helped lead the Nuggets to 46 wins and the NBA’s No. 6 offense, and his natural scoring instincts proved to be a strong fit with Nikola Jokic and Gary Harris. The hope is that Murray can hone his off-the-dribble three-pointer, a development that could help him join Curry in the 50/40/90 shooting club once his all-around game blossoms. A lack of size and physicality compromise his defensive value, but Murray is fiercer and more competitive than most people realize. Aside from top pick Ben Simmons, he may have the highest ceiling of any player in the 2016 draft. — BG For Saric (14.6 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 2.6 APG), instinct is a propulsive force. The 24-year-old has a preternatural sense of where to be and when. By the time Ben Simmons commits to making a pass, Saric has already raced through the backdoor on his way to the rim. He has a knack for turning up around any loose ball. If the defense is careless enough to box out without securing the rebound, Saric will be the first to it. Should an opponent get careless with a dribble hand-off, Saric might sniff out their negligence and poke the ball away.It’s not easy for a team to build off of that kind of situational awareness, but we saw in the postseason just how fruitful it can be. Saric was completely undaunted by his first playoff run. He stuck to his game—a dynamic mix of cutting, shooting, and playmaking—and found room to contribute across the board. There were always higher priorities for the Sixers than to get Saric involved, and yet he constantly worked his way into the mix. For all the careful planning that goes into an NBA game, sometimes it’s up to players like Saric to help a team find their flow. — RMIn the beginning, Bledsoe (17.7 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.0 APG) requested a trade from the Suns on Twitter—“I don’t wanna be here”—and then tried to deny it by pretending he was merely bored at a hair salon. In the end, he was outplayed and outtalked in the playoffs by Celtics guard Terry Rozier, who confused Bledsoe with a long-forgotten NFL quarterback who shared his surname. In between those memorable memes, the powerful, scoring-minded point guard managed to squeeze in a nice season, providing stability and talent to a Milwaukee backcourt that desperately needed both.Following a November trade to Milwaukee, Bledsoe quickly found his fit alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, boosting his new team’s offensive rating by nearly eight points when he took the court. While his defensive impact was muted given his propensity for risk-taking and brain farts, Bledsoe’s presence kept the Bucks’ season from being derailed by Malcolm Brogdon’s long-term injury. On balance, his Milwaukee experience revealed that his eye-popping stats from his Phoenix days were inflated, but that he was capable of being an above-average starting point guard on a winning team. Even if it’s not yet clear whether he’s a long-term answer in Milwaukee, the 28-year-old Bledsoe proved to be a heck of a midseason acquisition. — BG  If healthy, Porzingis (22.7 PPG, 6.6 RPG) would have had a strong case as a top–20 player. By record and point differential, the 2017-18 Knicks were a playoff bubble team with the Latvian big man on the court. After he suffered a season-ending ACL tear in early February, though, New York was pitiful, ranking No. 28 in winning percentage and No. 26 in net rating. Porzingis was on track to solidifying his reputation as a franchise player, and his unfortunate injury was the difference for the Knicks between being competitive and noncompetitive, relevant and irrelevant, watchable and unwatchable.The 23-year-old “Unicorn” lived up to his moniker last season, delivering a positive impact on both sides. He ranked No. 16 in scoring and No. 2 in blocks, shot nearly 40% as a high volume three-point shooter, and allowed just 48.7 FG% on shots attempted within six feet, a basket-protection rate that bested Rudy Gobert, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis. Unfortunately, the greatest ability is availability, and it’s not yet clear when Porzingis will return to the court or if he will return to his peak level of play during the 2018-19 season. — BGRudy Gobert casts a long shadow, the kind that obscures just how good his frontcourt partner can be. If transported to another team, Favors (12.3 PPG, 7.3 RPG) could anchor a defense all his own with even greater optionality. Gobert is the sort of defender whose strengths are so specific and so pronounced that they all but commit a team to defending a particular way. Any schematic discussion regarding Favors is more open-ended; his team could drop against the pick-and-roll, pressure the ball, switch outright, or even rotate between those options as some highly effective defenses do. No matter the approach, Favors is the kind of big you can trust to execute it.Or, if you’re the Jazz, you can roll out Favors and Gobert in tandem to stomp opponents down by 7.3 points per 100 possessions in the regular season and 10.9 points in the playoffs. Consider those data points with the necessary disclaimers (namely, that the Jazz limit the exposure of those big lineups in matchups they’re poorly suited for), but the reality of playing Favors at the four is less dated than one might think. For opponents other than the Rockets or Warriors, Favors can be punishing. Smaller forwards just don’t have much recourse when Favors rolls to the rim, but playing a more traditional big to counter Favors then plays right into the hands of the Jazz defense. Players don’t need to be dominant to help turn a specific matchup. They need only to have the right combination of skills at the right time, as Favors often does. — RMThe Suns have thrown every conceivable monkey wrench at Booker (24.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 4.7 APG) during his three seasons: changing coaches, trading away veterans, tanking for months, and whiffing on high draft picks. The 21-year-old shooting guard has responded in admirable fashion, improving his overall efficiency and becoming one of the highest-scoring young prospects in recent memory. Indeed, only four active players averaged more points than Booker during their age-21 seasons: LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and Karl-Anthony Towns. By forking over a five-year, $158 million extension this summer, Phoenix is betting that Booker can follow in that group’s All-Star footsteps and lift his team’s 30th-ranked offense to far greater potency.The Kentucky product still needs to prove he’s worthy of his Drake namecheck on “Sicko Mode,” largely because he plays with pick-up game intensity on the defensive end. Phoenix has had a worse defensive rating with Booker on the court than with him off the court in each of his three seasons, and he ranked outside the NBA’s top 200 players by Real Plus-Minus in 2017-18. If he played one-on-one against himself, the game would continue for hours because he would never get a stop. If he played for a better team, he would be hunted mercilessly in the playoffs. With Deandre Ayton and Trevor Ariza arriving to help stabilize and legitimize the Suns, it’s time for Booker to fully commit to leading a downtrodden franchise back to respectability. While Booker reportedly underwent hand surgery this week, the injury did not impact his Top 100 ranking because he's not expected to miss a significant portion of the regular season. — BGHouston has stretched every bit of Gordon’s (18.0 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 2.2 APG) game to its logical extreme. Gordon is remarkably strong for a guard, which means that the Rockets trust him to hold his own defensively against far bigger players. Opponents respect Gordon’s perimeter shooting, so Houston stations him far beyond the three-point arc to clear room for its pick-and-rolls—perhaps at the expense of Gordon’s three-point percentage. What used to be a more balanced shot profile has since polarized; in a fashion suiting Houston’s guiding principles, Gordon now takes well over 60% of his shots from beyond the arc. What mid-range shots he takes are largely provisional—products of when Gordon is asked to create some offense for himself. — RMCovington (12.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 1.7 SPG) warps around the court like a podcast played at double speed, he relishes contact like a middle linebacker, and he shadows scorers feint-for-feint like a professional dancer. With a full season of good health and team success to his name, the 27-year-old Sixers forward has solidified himself as the NBA’s premier 3-and-D wing. His 2018 All-Defensive First Team selection was a no-brainer, as he ranked first in deflections, third in Defensive Real-Plus Minus, fifth in Defensive Win Shares and sixth in steals for the NBA’s third-best defense.Although he is considerably older than star teammates Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, Covington stumbled badly during their first trip to the playoffs. A notoriously streaky shooter who managed to hit 36.9% of his threes during the regular season, he was yanked from the starting lineup in the second round against the Celtics when his jumper and confidence deserted him. Despite a rough May and the narrow nature of his offensive portfolio, Covington is perfectly suited for trendy interchangeable and switchable lineups. He’s satisfied filling a supplementary scoring role, and his combination of strength, length and quickness allows him to credibly defend four, if not all five, positions in smallball looks. Here’s betting that his future postseason work is considerably stronger than his 2018 showing. — BG Something about Brown (14.5 PPG, 4.9 RPG) is undeniable. Maybe it’s the way he takes borderline transition opportunities—the kind that other players might slow down and reset—and jams them down the opponent’s throat. It could be wholeheartedness in his soaring contests, each making the dutiful spectacular. More likely, it’s just the fact that Brown plays so hard on both sides of the ball that he’s never far away from some thrilling turn. What looks to be a standard, slow-developing possession can pop with a single cut or deflection. Even within Boston’s particular methodology, Brown knows only how to play in vivid color.It’s no surprise that he’s caught the eye of so many teams around the league, all of which would be thrilled to have a stake in Brown’s future. It took Brown all of two seasons to stabilize as a three-point shooter and calm some of the jumpier aspects of his defense. What might he be capable of in Year Three? Playing out the developmental scenarios is part of the fun, particularly when considering the counterfactuals of the past year.In a world where Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving don’t go down with season-ending injuries, Brown might be seen as more of an energy player than a potential star. Instead, he was force-fed royal jelly while essentially doubling his minutes. So many of the questions that come with young, high-motor players have already been asked and answered. We’ve seen that Brown can sustain his play in starters’ minutes. We know that he can withstand the scrutiny of playoff scouting. What’s beyond us is the future of a fascinating young player whose ceiling is at the mercy of any number of sliding doors. — RMGive Drummond (15 PPG, 16 RPG, 1.6 BPG) credit for seeking methods to evolve his game rather than settling for the dunk-and-rebound stereotype. Last season, the two-time All-Star center reclaimed his status as the NBA’s leading rebounder while also emerging as a capable distributor from the high post and a much-improved foul shooter. Then, in August, he vowed to add the three-point shot to his offensive repertoire after attempting just 30 total threes in his first six seasons.Unfortunately, Drummond’s explorative forays haven’t always produced clear progress in terms of his individual value or his team’s success. While his assist rate improved dramatically in 2017-18, so did his turnover rate. And while all sorts of centers are plotting how they can transform into stretch-fives, Drummond hasn’t exactly demonstrated much touch: He shot an abysmal 31.4% on shots from 3-10 feet and 28.6 from the mid-range last year. Frankly, the Pistons’ offense would be better off if he was never allowed to shoot from outside three feet. On the other end, the Drummond/Blake Griffin tandem fared well in a small sample size, providing some much-needed optimism for the wheel-spinning Pistons. Drummond, 25, might never fulfill his wildest dreams, but his size, durability, rebounding instincts and gradual refinements set him apart from replacement-level starting centers. — BGDragić (17.3 PPG, 4.1 RPG, 4.8 APG) plays a dramatic game, forever teetering on the edge of disaster. His signature is to go a step too far; no guard seems to find themselves double- and triple-teamed in the lane quite so often, and none, surely, has been so successful at improbably digging his way out. Some of Dragić’s layups require incredible contortions. His exit strategy often involves hovering in the air until he can sling some wild, wraparound pass. The result is often so impressive—and so improbable—that you forget that the peril was of Dragić’s own making.Yet for all his theatrics, Dragić settles in as merely quite good. It’s not as if his dramatic flair has proven self-destructive; on the contrary, Dragić only turns the ball over at a modest rate relative to other point guards. Miami seems comfortable running its offense through Dragić rather than for him. There are always larger plans at work, and not much of a compelling reason to assign Dragić some outsized role. Two important aspects of Dragić’s game, however, are never up for debate. The first is his fight, which is exceptional even in a competitive league. Dragić is a feisty sort who will never hesitate to drive into traffic, even after his face has swollen to cartoonish extremes. The other is his all-around competence—faint praise, perhaps, but the kind that makes the NBA go. — RMIn the past year, Harris (17.5 PPG, 2.6 RPG, 2.9 APG) proved that he can not only produce within an offense but give it structure. Dribble hand-offs between Harris and Nikola Jokic were as fundamental to Denver’s flow as any other mechanism. Jokic makes Harris look good, but the opposite is also true; a beautiful backdoor feed is only as effective as the cutter who inspires it.Part of what makes Harris so elusive is that you can never be sure where he’s going. Kyle Korver knows how to move without the ball but only has designs to move away from the basket. Andre Roberson is similarly unidirectional, albeit on the opposite track; the only time a defense even pays attention to Roberson’s movement is when he’s headed toward the rim. Harris is a dual threat and more. He could cut off a screen or reject it, move toward the ball or away from it, fake hard in any one direction before reversing course for the other, and take any angle he likes after finally receiving the ball. This is the predicament involved when a player shoots 72% within three feet of the rim and 40% beyond the arc. There is no safe assumption a defender can make —only the tireless work of chasing Harris everywhere he goes. — RMThe departures of Chris Paul and Blake Griffin granted a perfect opportunity to reassess Jordan (12 PPG, 15.2 RPG), a three-time All-NBA selection who served as a third wheel throughout his prime years. The results were mixed: the 30-year-old center remains an elite rebounder and high-efficiency finisher, but his overall defensive impact and rim-protection numbers slipped noticeably.Any faint hope that he might be able to expand his offensive game proved unfounded. After spending a full decade with the Clippers, Jordan drew limited interest and eventually agreed to a one-year, $22.9 million contract with the Mavericks.While Jordan remains an above-average center with standout leaping ability and a deep commitment to hitting the boards, he’s lost some of the pop that made him so devastating. Last season, Jordan’s block rate fell by more than half from his 2016 All-NBA First Team campaign. What’s more, he defended just 346 shots from within six feet (down more than a quarter from two years ago) and allowed 60.4% shooting on those shots (up 8.5% from two years ago). Not surprisingly, the Clippers dropped to 19th in defensive rating from their top-five standing two years ago. When the Mavericks courted Jordan in the fateful summer of 2015, they pitched him on life as a franchise center. At this point, that’s no longer realistic. — BGPorter (14.7 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.0 APG) isn’t one to amaze—only to steady his team with quiet capability. The vast majority of his shots are created for him, though Porter adds value the moment the ball touches his hands. If open on the perimeter, Porter (who finished third in three-point percentage last season) is a lights-out shooter with a high release point. Should the defense give his shot the respect it deserves, Porter can drive in response without veering out of control. Restraint is the through line of his game. One can always trust in Porter to play within himself, gifting his coaches and teammates a certain peace of mind. Porter is the player you never have to worry about.These are virtues best appreciated in contrast. If a team were composed entirely of players with Porter’s disposition, the offense might seesaw into eternity one non-committal pick-and-roll at a time. Yet in any more typical ecosystem, Porter would be welcome for his range, his patience, and his defense. Two-way, low-maintenance players are championship mortar. What Porter needs are the right bricks.If an opponent really wanted to scheme away Porter’s offense, they could. There’s nothing particularly intricate going on in how he gets his points. But attaching a defender to deny Porter shots will still serve his intended purpose, making life that much easier on the creators around him. Reducing the game to 4-on-4 will favor any competent offense. Porter, meanwhile, can still assume critical defensive responsibilities and facilitate his team’s best lineups by flexing between positions. Nothing is wasted with Porter, even when he assumes a background role. — RMLast season, Griffin (21.4 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 5.8 APG) posted a points/rebounds/assists line that was matched only by a pair of MVPs: LeBron James and Russell Westbrook. But that superstar-like productivity came draped with red flags: Griffin missed at least 15 games for the fourth straight season, his teams were 28-30 with him on the court, he ranked outside the top-50 in Real Plus-Minus, and his PER and True Shooting % reached career-lows. Unfortunately, a midseason trade to Detroit failed to reverse these trends. That blockbuster deal was harsh and illuminating, as it marked the first time that the Clippers had treated Griffin—whose dynamic athleticism has flatlined due to a series of injuries—as a $173 million contract rather than as a franchise player.As Griffin has sought to modernize his game and protect his body by playmaking from the perimeter and shooting more threes, he’s triggered an identity crisis. After the trade to the Pistons, he took just 21% of his shots from within three feet, well off the 44% from his peak posterization days. Similarly, he attempted just 4.4 free throws per game after the trade, sharply down from 8.4 per game back when he was an MVP candidate. The overwhelming night-to-night physicality that once made Griffin so special appears gone for good at age 29, leaving him as a good-but-not-great scoring threat and an adequate defender. — BGYes, 2017-18 was a junk season for the Grizzlies, and for Gasol, accordingly. Don’t read too much into his downward statistical trend (17.2 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 4.2 APG); once it became clear that Memphis had no shot to compete without Mike Conley, Gasol freewheeled his way through the season without all that much discipline or focus. Give him a real team and he’ll put forth a real effort. Take from that what you will. It might be nice if Gasol were the sort to rally the troops in spite of those circumstances, but there’s only so much playing with Jarell Martin and Ben McLemore a man can take.Decline, however, is inevitable. Gasol’s defense has already slipped; the player who won Defensive Player of the Year by keeping one step ahead of the action is gone thanks to slowing feet and reaction times. Gasol is a 33-year-old center at an especially difficult time to be a 33-year-old center. Just last season, there were only four true bigs who played more than 2,000 minutes at age 32 or older: Gasol, Dwight Howard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Marcin Gortat. Every year it will get a little tougher for Gasol to manage a star’s workload in a star’s minutes with a star’s responsibilities.What keeps him buoyant is his playmaking. A team can run its offense through Gasol by stationing him at the elbow or at the three-point line and running guards around him. Orienting an offense in that way opens up the player pool; when a point guard doesn’t have to shoulder the weight of the offense, all sorts of combo guards and kind-of-guards become more viable. New avenues into the offense present themselves. The only way to survive a long season and an ensuing playoff run is through frequent adaptation. Think of Gasol as a means for problem solving—not only to get the ball where it needs to go, but to keep the best players on the floor and arrange them in the most productive ways. — RMThe Boston media spent months comparing Tatum (13.9 PPG, 5 RPG) to NBA legends and predicting a decade’s worth of All-Star appearances for the rookie forward, and then a funny thing happened in the playoffs: He somehow exceeded the hype. Tatum scored 20 points in a Game 7 win over Milwaukee. He easily outdueled 2018 Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons, scoring 20+ points in all five second-round games. And, most impressively of all, he played a leading role in pushing Cleveland to Game 7 in the East finals, where he famously dunked on and chest-bumped LeBron James. Suddenly, the entire global basketball community was gushing like Tommy Heinsohn over Tatum’s poise, polish and gumption.Tatum, 20, possesses all the fundamental elements to become a star wing. He has an effortless shooting stroke, nailing a preposterous 43.4% of his threes as a rookie. He knows a good shot from a bad shot, and he can create quality looks off the dribble and with an array of turnaround moves. He has excellent footwork and pacing. He isn’t reckless or selfish with the ball. He’s quick, long, smart and committed defensively. The biggest question at this point seems to be how quickly Tatum will reach his ceiling in Boston, given that the returns of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward could potentially cut into his touches and shots. Regardless, this much seems clear: Tatum is too skilled to be buried, even on a budding superteam. — BGAdams (13.9 PPG, 9.0 RPG) played the third-most minutes of any center in the league last season because 1) he tends to stay healthy, and 2) he can’t be played off the floor. Any attempt to weed out Adams all but fails before it starts. Small ball is no real deterrent. Adams can hold his own on the perimeter to the point that he isn’t easily exploited. Meanwhile, some poor, undersized center is left to contend with one of the strongest players in the league. If Adams can politely nudge opposing centers out of the way when necessary, what hope does a power forward masquerading as a center really have?The real payoff for that strength comes on offense, where the Thunder grabbed 31.6% of their own misses with Adams on the floor last season, per NBA.com. This is an offense unto itself. Adams may not be scoring all that much, but his efforts renew possessions and redeem low shooting percentages. Solvency comes easy when a team is allowed to take a mulligan on nearly a third of its misses, and potentially more when no true center is around to box Adams out. There’s just no working around the fact that Adams is a proper giant. He can wipe out a guard with a screen and bulldoze a big with a roll. Players of that size aren’t supposed to move around the floor so easily, and yet here is Adams, gliding through contact after teaching himself how. You might not consider Adams a standout athlete, but he’s made himself into one. — RMDenver’s bold, expensive off-season play for Millsap (14.6 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 2.8 APG) had fizzled by Thanksgiving due to a wrist injury that sidelined the four-time All-Star forward for more than half of last season. Although Millsap posted his worst individual numbers in nearly a decade and the Nuggets failed to reach the playoffs for the fifth straight year, there were some promising signs. For starters, Denver posted a +4.1 net rating with Millsap on the court—equivalent to the league’s No. 6 ranking—and he made the Nuggets more efficient on both sides. Perhaps most importantly, Millsap and Nikola Jokic posted a strong +8 net rating in nearly 900 minutes together, providing convincing evidence that the frontcourt pairing will work well in 2018-19 if healthy.The 33-year-old Millsap has entered the decline stage of a typical age curve, yet his role flexibility should help soften the blow. Thanks to his unselfish nature and capable three-point shooting, he doesn’t need to dominate the ball to be a helpful offensive player. His willingness to shift down to a complementary role—something some former All-Stars reject outright—provides room for the Nuggets’ young backcourt to blossom. Plus, his savvy, workmanlike and versatile defensive game provides cover for the multiple minus defenders that surround him in the starting lineup. If the Nuggets vault into the playoffs as some projection models expect, Millsap’s fingerprints will be all over the rise even if he is overshadowed by his flashier teammates. — BG Were there no concern for injury, Conley—a two-way, All-Star-level guard—would rank far better than he does here. To actually follow through on that ranking, however, would require rationalizing away the 109 games that Conley missed over the past three years. There is no single, chronic injury at work but an assortment of seemingly unrelated issues. The latest was a bone intrusion in his left heel, addressed through surgery back in January. Conley is as resilient as athletes come, but his resilience is also tested more often than most. Any predictive ranking must account for that, particularly with Conley now in his early 30s.This disclaimer is made with the full knowledge that a healthy Conley is a freaking terror. Very few point guards can match his creative depth; Conley has the handle and quickness to go anywhere he wants on the floor, not to mention the skill and touch to score when he gets there. Conley’s game is setups on setups on setups. What looks like an actual move—and would be in lesser hands—is really just prologue, scripted to set expectations for the sole purpose of defying them. By the time Conley’s defender realizes they’re stuck in the blender, it’s already too late.There’s no weak hand to shade, and no range at which you can give Conley space. The last time we saw Conley really do his thing, he was bombing away from beyond the arc with the frequency of Kyrie Irving, Donovan Mitchell, and Devin Booker—all while hitting better than 40%. His array of runners is the envy of the league. Some scoring option is always available to him, though Conley is perfectly willing to move the ball and defer to the offense. The most dangerous moment in guarding Conley comes then: At the moment of exhale, before it clicks that he only gave up the ball to get it back on a dribble hand-off. — RMAs one of the NBA’s top young centers, it’s no surprise that Capela (13.9 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 1.9 BPG) has buttered his bread in the basket area: He shot a league-high 65.2% thanks to a parade of lobs, defended a league-high 588 shots from within six feet, and ranked eighth with 42 double-doubles. Unlike many of his positional counterparts, though, the 24-year-old Capela has found numerous ways to inject mobility into possessions. He doesn’t camp on the block looking for post-up opportunities, and he covers ground from end to end like few players his size. Even when Houston goes to its slow-down half-court isolation mode, Capela darts through space to set high screens and knifes through multiple bodies to chase offensive rebounds.In the West finals, Capela’s unique combination of length, agility and activity made him surprisingly resilient against the Warriors. Houston’s two favorite lineups against Golden State both featured Capela instead of a small-ball five, and together the groups were a net-positive over the seven-game series. He can’t play-make or shoot the three like Draymond Green, but Capela represents a new archetype for a modern title contender: a rim-running, screen-setting, alley-ooping, glass-crashing and shot-blocking center who can show and switch against all five positions without getting embarrassed. Houston, understanding Capela’s rare skill profile, wisely inked him to a five-year, $90 million deal in late July. — BGHis game has drawn endless comparisons to Dwyane Wade and his marketability is straight from the Damian Lillard playbook, but the recent star that Mitchell (20.5 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 3.7 APG) most embodied down the stretch was a young Derrick Rose. The unadulterated calm and confidence. The willingness to sacrifice life and limb to get to the rim. The savior scoring role on a roster built for defense. The ability to get veteran teammates to buy in—fully and eagerly—to everything he was selling. The measured responses to stunning triumphs. The euphoric embrace from his home crowd.Such lofty comparisons are appropriate for Mitchell, who became just the third rookie guard to average 20+ PPG since 1990. The 22-year-old guard kept raising the bar as he led Utah past Oklahoma City in the first round: 28 points in Game 2 to steal homecourt advantage, 33 points in Game 4 to take a 3-1 lead, and then 38 points in Game 6 to send Russell Westbrook packing. While the Rockets were able to dissect the Jazz in round two, Mitchell’s postseason debut made it clear that he’s set up for major success. His next steps—improving as a three-point shooter, getting to the line more frequently, and growing as a facilitator—are refinements rather than quantum leaps. If Rose was Chicago’s first superstar of the post-Jordan era, Mitchell might very well become Utah’s most beloved and decorated player since Stockton and Malone. — BGWhen a Twitter heckler requested that he stay focused on advancing in the playoffs rather than talking trash about the Warriors, McCollum (21.4 PPG, 4 RPG, 3.4 APG) responded by unleashing a plaintive wail that inspired tribute t-shirts: “I’m trying Jennifer.” The viral comeback was doubly honest, as it reflected McCollum’s dedication to his craft and acknowledged Portland’s painful back-to-back first-round sweeps. Indeed, there can be no questioning the 2016 Most Improved Player’s commitment: McCollum has missed just five total games over the past three seasons, he’s forged a successful and non-combative star partnership with Damian Lillard, and he was a rare bright spot for the Blazers in the 2018 playoffs.In many ways, McCollum, 26, has developed into an ideal No. 2 scoring option: he can create a shot, he can run the offense for a bench-heavy lineup, he can attack mismatches, he can shoot the three, he can draw attention when he’s off the ball, and he has a good feel for when to defer versus when to take over. Despite this, Portland’s hard ceiling has led observers to wonder whether he would be better suited to running his own team or whether Lillard would be better off paired with a bigger, longer and more defensive-minded partner. Here’s a more compelling hypothetical: How far could Lillard and McCollum go together if GM Neil Olshey ever gave them a league-average supporting cast? Chances are, the Jennifers of the world would need to find new material. — BGBefore you hold Charlotte’s poor performance against Walker, note that the Hornets were actually a winning team whenever he was on the floor. In those minutes, Charlotte outscored their opponents by 3.5 points per 100 possessions, according to NBA.com—a comparable margin to that of the 55-27 Celtics. Walker (22.1 PPG, 3.1 RPG, 5.6 APG) was a star in all matters he could actually control. Holding him accountable for a disastrous backup point guard rotation would be akin to blaming him for concession prices or parking availability.If anything, Walker had a valiant year. His play was the saving grace of an undermanned roster, which he led without making a fuss. Even when he was featured in trade rumors of the team owner’s own making, Walker went out of his way to express loyalty to the city and organization that brought him into the NBA. When he had every right to be frustrated, Walker just went to work.It’s easy to play for a teammate like that. Walker digs in, as is evident through his continued self-improvement. The subtle refinement of his off-the-dribble game has made Walker a better creator and the transformation of his jumper has made him a bigger threat; together, that combination has cinched his reputation as one of the most prolific pull-up jumpshooters in the league. Walker created about as many unassisted threes last season as anyone not named James Harden. Opponents, now wise to this, are tempted to overreact. The more dangerous Walker becomes, the better the opportunities for his teammates that result. It’s only the most obvious way that Walker makes the players around him better. — RMLet’s establish, first, what Love (17.6 PPG, 9.3 RPG) is not. Love is not a helpful defender. One stop—no matter how crucial—doesn’t overwrite hours of film in which Love has been targeted and exploited. Love is not a primary scorer for a playoff-caliber team. The memory of Minnesota Love isn’t just five years old, but a relic of a different time altogether. Even if he could tap back into that version of himself, today’s defenses are better schooled in tracking Princeton-style movement and more aware of Love’s limitations. Love, though, is not just a role player. The cost of playing alongside LeBron James is the reduction of your game to its most basic elements. That got the Cavs to four straight Finals but reduced Love to a standstill shooter in the process.Love can make that work (he rated as one of the most efficient spot-up shooters in the league last season, per Synergy Sports), but not only that. The great casualty of his move to Cleveland was the opportunity to make plays. When the Cavs put the ball in Love’s hands, they did so with the intention that he get buckets rather than run offense. It’s an important distinction. Love doesn’t really have the handle or the post game to manufacture shots on command. But letting him read the action for an offense that actually moves could work to the benefit of all involved. Love, even through the simplest implementation, is a star who can create real problems for opposing bigs. The only question is how far his team wants to go to maximize what he does best. — RM DeRozan (23.0 PPG, 3.9 RPG, 5.2 APG) made an earnest effort to reformat his game last season that, in the end, didn’t mean much. Encouraging as it was for DeRozan to venture beyond the arc in the regular season, he bailed on the notion of even attempting a three-pointer in the playoffs—after missing 13 straight. The free-flowing style of the Raptor offense encouraged DeRozan to move the ball until it didn’t; once the system clammed up in the second round, so, too, did DeRozan’s passing. There is more to DeRozan than how he performed against LeBron James and the Cavs. That said, the end of that series (also the end of DeRozan’s Raptors career) was especially vivid: a Game 3 benching followed by a Game 4 ejection, giving way to a sweep, a trade, and the end of an era.The lesson of the Raptors is that a franchise could easily build a playoff team around DeRozan. It’s building a championship team that’s the trouble—in part because a seven-game series airs out DeRozan’s every liability. In that setting, his defense becomes catastrophic, as was the case against the Cavs. Free throws are harder to come by. The same moves that worked for DeRozan throughout the regular season become tougher to pull off against carefully tailored defenses. And when his scoring game stalls, DeRozan—who doesn’t really cut and doesn’t trust his own three-point shooting—has no real way to contribute.I say all this only to illustrate the differences between the two DeMars. One is a rock: a steadying influence through a long regular season. The other is not, until he proves otherwise.  — RMIt would come as no surprise if Damian Lillard still jolts awake in the dead of night, the memory of Holiday’s playoff defense still fresh in his mind. There are defenders who try hard, who play smart, and who put on a good show. Holiday (19.0 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.0 APG) cuts straight through everything to deny a scorer that which he holds dear. It doesn’t take him long to figure out where his opponent wants the ball, and once he does, he shuts down most every lifeline leading there.Holiday is one of the NBA’s best defensive players. The usual limitations regarding point guards don’t really apply; he’s tall (a listed 6’4”), he’s long (his wingspan, at the time of his drafting, was measured at 6’7”), and he’s too strong to be pushed around. That gave New Orleans the flexibility to move Holiday between perimeter assignments as needed. Against the Warriors, for example, Holiday was the Pelicans’ best shot at defending Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Kevin Durant.It’s a wonder where he finds the energy. Holiday works a double shift under a huge minutes load: first as a defensive stopper, then as one of the leaders of an offense. New Orleans brought in another point guard (Rajon Rondo) to help Holiday manage, though functionally his role wasn’t all that different; New Orleans was still at its best when Holiday was able to direct traffic, and his production held regardless of whether Rondo was on the floor with him. Holiday is a universal complement. Play him at either guard spot and in almost any capacity. His game knows no bad fit. — RMAfter a hamstring injury cost him most of the 2016-17 season, Middleton (20.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.0 APG) bounced back better than even his most optimistic supporters could have hoped. The versatile 27-year-old wing posted career-highs in scoring, rebounds, assists, PER, True Shooting % and Win Shares while playing all 82 games and logging nearly 3,000 minutes. Milwaukee’s season saw all sorts of ups and downs, but the Giannis Antetokounmpo/Middleton pairing was reliable and successful throughout. The duo crested during a first-round series against Boston, when Antetokounmpo left Brad Stevens shaking his head with multiple 30-point games and a scorching-hot Middleton posted a playoff-best 71.9 TS%.Middleton, much like Paul George, is ideally suited to a No. 2 role, and his completely transferrable game could complement everyone from Antetokounmpo to James Harden to Anthony Davis. Offensively, he can shoot the three, create a shot, and generate high-percentage scoring opportunities by beating help defense with the pass. Defensively, he can switch seamlessly through multiple positions and handle lead assignments thanks to his quickness and length. The Bucks’ next step under new coach Mike Budenholzer is clear: Construct a five-man offensive system that reduces the need for Antetokounmpo and Middleton to grind out isolation half-court buckets. With a little more structural help and a little less one-on-one, the understated Middleton might finally achieve the recognition and postseason success that has long eluded him. — BGThis was a stretch season for Beal (22.6 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 4.5 APG), who not only played all 82 games for the first time in his career but went half that time without John Wall. The experience was illuminating. We saw Beal run even more pick-and-roll than usual, approaching each with a new disposition. Taking over the responsibility for an offense can’t help but change a player. Even though Beal will always see the game as a scorer first, he was more patient when it came to reading the floor and letting his options develop. The lesson, contrary to the extreme reaction at the time, was not that the Wizards are better off without Wall. It was that the Wizards are better off without Wall dominating the offense, which Beal could do more to help orchestrate.Every year, Beal’s handle gets a little tighter. His crossovers these days aren’t quite so unruly, which allows him to work in straighter lines. The more direct Beal’s game is, the better; he’s so good at slamming on the brakes—only to pull-up for a jumper or pivot into one—that any momentum he generates works to his advantage. Beal’s touch is natural, but his moves are earned. You can see the patterns in his footwork that would only materialize through repetition, as he sorts out how to attack out of any situation and at any angle. Maybe the most underrated part of Beal’s game is the sheer accessibility of his scoring. No matter where he’s positioned, there’s always a way through. — RMAlthough Simmons (15.8 PPG, 8.1 RPG, 8.2 APG) is only 22 years old, he has already provided convincing answers to most of the pre-draft questions that surfaced in 2016. He’s not a point guard? Simmons was the lead ball-handler for one of the league’s most devastating five-man lineups, claiming 2018 Rookie of the Year honors and joining John Wall as the only rookies to average 15+ PPG and 8+ APG during the last 20 years. He has a questionable motor? Simmons came out of the gate as a clear plus defender—ranking 35th league-wide in Real Plus-Minus—while also carrying Philadelphia to eight straight wins without Joel Embiid to close the season. He won’t be able to bully his way to the hoop against NBA-caliber defenders like he did in college and high school? Simmons’s shot distribution chart looks like it belongs to an elite center, as he hit 74.4% of his shots in the basket area and took nearly half of his attempts from within three feet.There was, of course, one knock that did stick: his total lack of shooting. Despite playing more than 2,700 minutes, Simmons attempted just 11 three-pointers and didn’t make any. Among established star-level perimeter players, there really isn’t a modern comparison for that degree of perimeter futility, although John Wall, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and DeMar DeRozan all struggled mightily early in their careers. Philadelphia’s second-round series loss to Boston proved that Simmons can’t always work around his Achilles heel. Without a jumper to extend the defense, the Australian point forward was held in check, stymied by the Celtics’ interior bodies and forced into more turnovers than the Sixers could stomach. Yet focusing only on his uneven play against Boston would be misrepresentative of a spectacular rookie season: Simmons is one of the NBA’s brightest young lights, and he appears poised to make his All-Star Game debut in 2019. — BGThis ranking takes a relatively conservative view on Hayward, who suffered gruesome, compounding leg injuries five minutes into his first game of the 2017-18 season. Should Hayward look just as good as he did before those injuries (or better), a spot in the top 20 could be entirely reasonable. It just can’t be guaranteed—not after Hayward was immobilized, reduced to shooting from a chair, and categorically ruled out even as the Celtics played late into May. A full, uncomplicated recovery can’t always be taken on faith.What’s more certain is Hayward’s skill level. It’s probably for the best if he isn’t his team’s leading scorer, though all other options are on the table. His game is deeply agreeable. More fluid systems could lean on Hayward to read his surroundings and make plays, while a more scripted offense could fall back on his ability to cut and curl. Hayward has made himself into the kind of wing who can consistently hit difficult shots; years of working off the ball have led him to make the most of tight windows, while a stronger frame helps to absorb contact in the middle of a runner or jumper.He’ll be great for the Celtics because he’d be great pretty much anywhere. Two-way wings create possibilities. They don’t necessitate playing any certain way, but they make it easier to adapt—particularly when, like Hayward, they can guard well across three positions. There isn’t an offense Hayward can’t better or a defense he can’t execute. His game is all options. — RMAs always, Wall (19.4 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 9.6 APG) has paid careful attention to the perception of his standing relative to his peers, noting in an August interview with NBA Sports Washington that “a lot of guys don’t talk about me being a top-five point guard.” Although SI.com ranked Wall as the fifth-best point guard and 13th overall player at this time last year, it’s impossible to argue that he lived up to that billing. The five-time All-Star missed half the season due to injury, ranked outside the top 45 by PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP, and was quickly bounced in the first round of the playoffs. At 28, Wall has never led a 50-win team, he’s led just one top-10 offense, and he’s won just three total playoff series during his eight-year career. That body of work doesn’t compare—at all—to the likes of Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Russell Westbrook.If Wall returns to full health and 20/10 production, he belongs in the mix for a top-five spot with the next tier of point guards: Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving and Kyle Lowry. But regaining his footing in that conversation requires more than just flashing his incredible athleticism, maintaining his improved three-point percentage, and recommitting himself on the defensive end. Wall spent a good portion of last year sniping with Marcin Gortat, and his ball-dominant approach briefly led critics to wonder if Washington was better off without him when he was injured. If Wall can make meaningful strides as an inclusive and empowering leader both on and off the court, the Wizards are far more likely to reach their playoff ceiling. When that happens, he won’t need to waste his time and energy fighting for respect. He’ll get his due. — BGKudos to Lowry (16.2 PPG, 5.6 RPG, 6.9 APG), the sole remaining survivor in Toronto’s triumvirate of blame. With Dwane Casey and DeMar DeRozan both gone following another humiliating loss to LeBron James, it’s worth taking a moment to recognize what the coach and his star guards accomplished together: five straight seasons with 48+ wins, the five winningest seasons in franchise history, five playoff appearances, four playoff series victories, and a trip to the East finals. During Lowry’s six-year tenure in Toronto, the Raptors have won 297 games, the most of any Eastern Conference team. Now, at age 32, Lowry will plunge forward with a rookie coach and a rehabilitated Kawhi Leonard in search of his first trip to the Finals.Although Lowry’s individual numbers diminished last season, the fall-off was mostly attributable to a more careful management of his minutes rather than a dramatic change in his ability. The four-time All-Star logged five fewer minutes per game during the regular season, a substantial strategic adjustment that helped him play 78 games and turn in easily the most efficient postseason of his career. While Lowry remains a strong outside shooter and a dynamic all-around offensive player, his age might be starting to show on the other end. He led the league with 37 drawn charges in 2017-18, but his impact stats weren’t quite as impressive as in recent years. This much is clear: No one benefits more from Leonard’s arrival than Lowry, who gets to move to a shotgun role alongside an MVP-level champion at the exact moment his own window as an elite point guard was starting to close. — BGPondering Thompson (20 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 2.5 APG) in a vacuum is a far more enriching mental exercise than assessing his play with the Warriors because he is the definition of a known quantity. The 28-year-old sharpshooter has produced nearly identical numbers for four straight seasons now, ranking among the NBA’s deadliest three-point marksmen and its most respected perimeter defenders.Although a fluky thumb injury caused him to miss a career-high nine games in 2017-18, Thompson was as lethal as ever during the postseason run to Golden State’s third title in four years. His personal highlight: draining nine three-pointers in a do-or-die Game 6 in the West finals, a season-saving explosion that mirrored his epic Game 6 against the Thunder two years earlier.When listing off the reasons that the Warriors are “unfair,” don’t forget that their third option is a stone-cold sniper with a quick trigger who also happens to love grinding out defensive possessions against star wings.Place Thompson on a team with average talent and a need for him to play a leading role, and there’s no telling exactly how things would turn out. His limitations as an off-the-dribble creator and a playmaker for others would show through quickly, and his efficiency would surely dip with lower-percentage looks. How hard would he need to work to get open without Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant? Would his occasional streakiness be held against him more often if he was the No. 1 option? Would his pressure defense be held in the same regard if Draymond Green wasn’t behind him to play clean up? These are intriguing questions, but they will remain hypotheticals for the foreseeable future thanks to Thompson’s willingness to sacrifice in Ginobili-like fashion. Here in reality, he’s bound to keep swishing threes and stacking rings in his perfect role with the champs. — BGAldridge (23.1 PPG, 8.5 RPG, 2.0 APG) returns after a genuinely remarkable season, in which he reconciled with the Spurs, staved off decline, and played every bit to an All-NBA standard. San Antonio’s offense was solvent solely because of him. All the ball movement was cute, but 20 seconds of good intentions often ended in Aldridge bailing his teammates out. A lack of shooting in the lineup left Aldridge the space of a broom closet. He responded with arguably his best season to date, anchoring a 47-win team in the process.It’s less than ideal to rely on Aldridge in that way, but—as the Spurs proved—it’s really not the worst thing in the world. When he’s comfortable, Aldridge is tough to deny. His usual array of shots is easily manufactured, even in the face of attentive defense. Those opponents who can cause problems for Aldridge’s face-up game won’t generally have much impact on his back-to-the-basket play. There’s only so much that can be done to challenge the release of a 6’11” shooter from all angles.Some regression could be in order. Aldridge wasn’t unusually accurate from any range last season in a way that would raise alarm, but he is a 33-year-old with more than a decade of star-level usage. That hurts his case in a top-25 field that is otherwise quite young—full of players either in the thick of their primes or with their best years still to come. Aldridge is on the other side. The question is not whether his numbers hold but for how long. — RMBefore last season, Oladipo (23.1 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.3 APG) barely needed a trophy case: the 2013 No. 2 pick’s unspectacular career was highlighted by a second-place finish in the 2015 Slam Dunk Contest, an $84 million extension that many observers felt was too generous, and a front-row seat for Russell Westbrook shooting 34 times in an elimination-game defeat. Now? Oladipo has enough hardware to start a personal shrine after earning Most Improved Player, All-Star, All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive First Team honors in one of the great mid-career breakouts in recent memory.The 26-year-old scoring guard displayed numerous improvements following a trade from Oklahoma City to Indiana: he shot the three at a career-high rate, he worked in a more reliable off-the-dribble jumper, he attacked the rim with greater purpose, and he committed to becoming a disruptive defender on a nightly basis. Importantly, Oladipo also settled in as a late-game option, ranking fourth in clutch scoring and leading the pesky, overachieving Pacers to a 24-17 record in games that were within five points in the last five minutes. Perhaps the best way to gauge Oladipo’s value came when he was sidelined for seven games: Indiana went 0-7 and lost by an average of 14 points. The East’s No. 5 seed could have been mistaken for the Suns or Grizzlies without its franchise player. This ranking reflects a degree of skepticism that Oladipo’s sensational season—he ranked sixth in Real Plus-Minus, 11th in WARP and 19th in PER—is his new normal. However, his explosiveness, buy-in, and two-way impact should keep him in the All-Star conversation, even if he sustains natural regression or falters a bit under enhanced expectations. — BGTowns (21.3 PPG, 12.3 RPG, 2.4 APG) has every tool at his disposal, every advantage one could hope for. If only he had full command of them. Scoring comes easy; Towns is one of the few genuinely dominant post players left, though in his spare time he moonlights as a 42.1% three-point shooter and one of the quickest-driving centers in the league. It’s the combination of those skills that makes Towns’s occasional disappearances—as in the first few games of Minnesota’s lone playoff series—all the more mystifying. In those moments, he looked every bit a 22-year-old.For as much as Towns can do, there’s still a lot he hasn’t quite figured out. Defense seems to elude him—an issue made all the more glaring by his position. When a young guard takes a bad angle or gives up on a play, there are multiple levels of defensive infrastructure to bail him out. Not so for centers, who are asked to make split-second decisions and cover tons of ground with no safety net. Mastering the rhythms of team defense is as difficult as any part of NBA life. Towns, though, is still striving for competence.He’ll get there. In the meantime, the Wolves will have to settle for his unbelievable efficiency, his strong rebounding, and his matchup-detonating versatility. The thrill with Towns is knowing that this is only the beginning. If some part of his game hasn’t quite crystallized, check back in a few months. — RMJokic (18.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 6.1 APG) has the Midas touch, where every pass that leaves his hand fosters some golden opportunity. He’ll find a cutter well beyond the bounds of typical offense. A shooter will have a cross-court pass from Jokic drop straight into his shooting pocket, synced perfectly to an opponent’s rotation. The degree to which Jokic makes his teammates better is genuinely staggering. If you can shoot or move or score at all, his vision will all but guarantee a career year. Hell, Denver’s equipment manager probably goes on to have a productive day whenever Jokic hands over his jersey for laundry or his shoes for storage. It’s uncanny.That rising tide reflects especially well on Jokic for the purposes of this exercise. If we assume that every player on our list is surrounded by fairly average teammates as a sort of vacuum test, Jokic is among the most likely to elevate them. A middling role player will rarely look so good as when Jokic is force-feeding them points. This was a key point of separation between Jokic and Karl-Anthony Towns in the determination of their rankings. Both rebound well, space the floor, and score at similar rates. Neither is much of a defender. Jokic, though, averaged more assists per game than any other center in the three-point era, and has the receipts to prove his passing’s effect. One could easily prefer Towns as a matter of taste, though Jokic might do slightly more for an offense at this point in their careers. — RMIrving (24.4 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 5.1 APG) spent his first season with the Celtics in effortless synchronicity, right up until the deflating moment that knee complications brought it to a premature end. The five-time All-Star point guard was quick on the ball, flirting with the first 50/40/90 season of his career and thriving in space as the lead playmaker in a well-balanced attack. He was quick as a professional, landing himself on a premier franchise and a budding superteam after foreseeing Cleveland’s demise and the shifting tides in the East. And he was quick to dispel numerous criticisms that had built up during his Cavaliers tenure. Throughout a brilliant 16-game winning streak, Irving proved that he could thrive as an alpha rather than as a sidekick, that he could balance his scoring and distributing without rubbing his co-stars the wrong way, that he could be the major personality on a winning team despite his quirks, and that he could play big minutes on an elite defense.Unfortunately, the 26-year-old Irving’s substantial personal progress, a postseason date with former teammate LeBron James, and a likely trip to the Finals all went poof when he was lost for the season in mid-March. Irving has now missed 21% of his team’s regular-season games during his seven-year career, and another injury this season would complicate his 2019 free agency. As the former No. 1 pick progresses through his prime, health clearly represents the last major hurdle separating him from an annual spot on the All-NBA teams and a consensus “Top 10” reputation. —BGHorford (12.9 PPG, 7.4 RPG, 4.7 APG) is a patron saint of the Top 100, in that he embodies so many of the attributes we tend to value highly. He plays both sides of the ball without condition, and in a way that makes everyone around him better. His game is both reliable enough to anchor a team and versatile enough to allow for changes on the fly. He fits the modern game. Nothing in Horford’s style or skill set would make him a target in a playoff series. If anything, his incredible basketball literacy would poke holes in an opponent’s game plan in real time. The way he plays upholds a standard and the way he carries himself can establish a culture. Horford exudes a winning effect. He was one of the most important players in the entire league last season, and this ranking reflects that.At the same time, evaluating the future of any 32-year-old deserves some caution—as does isolating the value of any one, particular Celtic. Horford could be at his absolute best in Boston, if only because the organization seems to value him fully. Yet even if he were playing with lesser teammates for a lesser coach, Horford would invariably raise the level of execution. He’s too smart not to. If his influence didn’t bear out through his own individual defense, it would in the way he directs traffic. Even if he wasn’t in a position to make plays, Horford would intuitively screen or space the floor for others.From an impact perspective, Horford is only a few degrees removed from Draymond Green. Both rank among the league’s best defensive players (Horford, for what it’s worth, led the top defense overall) and augment high-functioning offenses with their playmaking. And each, in his own way, has made himself completely indispensable to one of the best teams in the league. The Celtics were forced to do without their two biggest stars last season. They marched all the way to the Eastern Conference finals regardless—because their most valuable player was still in uniform. — RMAfter years of griping about his All-Star snubs, Lillard (26.9 PPG, 4.5 RPG, 6.6 APG) backed into a far better honor: The 2018 All-NBA First Team. For once, the murky voting criteria—stats, winning, name recognition, narrative—coalesced in his favor. The 28-year-old point guard was healthier than Stephen Curry, Chris Paul and Jimmy Butler, and his Blazers were steadier and more functional than Russell Westbrook’s Thunder. His statistical portfolio was impeccable: He ranked top five in scoring, top 10 in clutch points, top 10 in PER, Win Shares and WARP, and top 15 in Real Plus-Minus. And Lillard had a compelling story too: He was a highly-respected offensive weapon, an improved defender, and the unquestioned leader of an overachieving No. 3 seed.By the time Lillard’s well-deserved moment in the sun was announced in May, Portland was smarting from an embarrassing first-round sweep against New Orleans. Although that series exposed Lillard’s struggles in the face of a physical trapping defense, it was a more damning indictment of his weak supporting cast.Kyrie Irving might be a better and more exciting ball-handler than Lillard, but he’s had consistent health problems and likely wouldn’t fare much better when surrounded by lineups with two or three holes. Kyle Lowry might be more imposing and experienced than Lillard, but he’s had his own postseason struggles despite much deeper rosters around him. John Wall might be faster and more explosive than Lillard, but his shot selection and questionable leadership are unavoidable concerns. In this tier of imperfect star point guards, Lillard seems to possess the most dependable strengths and the most manageable flaws. — BGGobert (13.5 PPG, 10.7 RPG, 2.3 BPG) is so imposing that he actually changes the psychology of a game. Opponents with the ball in hand turn their focus inward; you can see confident players talk themselves out of shots they would ordinarily love to take, all for fear of Gobert swatting them away. Many teams will go to amazing lengths to pull Gobert away from the basket—challenging him laterally rather than vertically—but there’s only so much you can do to separate from a 7’1” shot-blocker with Gobert’s instincts. An incredible number of plays will always be in his reach.His presence provides a sense of order, a way of life. Utah orients its entire defense around Gobert, knowing that he’ll not only influence a ton of shots himself, but give teammates license to apply their own pressure. This has a constricting effect. Passing lanes are tighter. Driving lanes are contested. It’s difficult to even work through your offense against Gobert and the Jazz, much less score. Defenders are emboldened at every turn, channeling Gobert’s confidence. Gobert plays with the sureness of a player who knows exactly what he is. There are no misconceptions to his game—no indulgent post-ups or rash dribble moves. Just no-frills, highly efficient offense predicated on putting as little space between him and the rim as possible. Cutting off his access to the basket is easier said than done; even last season’s Rockets, who switched as capably as any team in the league, couldn’t entirely deny Gobert’s rolls, cuts, and put-backs. There are some things you can never take away from a seven-footer when he’s wholly committed to playing his game. — RM“There are 82-game players, then there are 16-game players.” The Athletic reported that bit of wisdom was delivered by Green (11 PPG, 7.6 RPG, 7.3 APG) to Golden State’s front office as draft advice, but the distinction helps explain the versatile power forward’s evolution as he continues through his prime. Now, more than ever, the 28-year-old Green is a 16-game player: a dynamic defensive mastermind who saves his best work for the playoffs.During the Warriors’ third title run, Green played a key role in defending LaMarcus Aldridge and Anthony Davis while offering constant help on the likes of James Harden, Chris Paul and LeBron James. He led Golden State in minutes, rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals during the playoffs. His absurd 99.5 defensive rating was a major reason the champs skated through Stephen Curry’s absence, survived Kevin Durant’s choppy stretches in the West finals, and swept James out of Cleveland in the Finals. And despite being listed at 6’7”, Green led the NBA by defending 158 shots from within six feet during the playoffs. He allowed just 54.4% on those shots, a postseason rim-protection rate that’s comparable to long-armed shot-blockers like Davis and Clint Capela.Green’s offensive utility has slipped slightly over the last two years: his three-point shooting has regressed, and his pick-and-roll playmaking has taken a backseat to accommodate Durant’s arrival. Regardless, he’s a skilled and willing passer who would be able to function as a quality secondary playmaker even if he wasn’t surrounded by All-Stars on all sides. The eye test and his impact stats agree that Green has learned to dial back his effort level in the regular season, and that’s a luxury he wouldn’t have on most teams. Then again, Green’s postseason prowess and leadership during big moments are major reasons why Golden State can get away with coasting in the first place. — BGLeonard (16.2 PPG, 4.7 RPG, 2.3 APG) ranked fourth on last year’s SI.com Top 100 because he possesses so many of the qualities this list aims to celebrate and appreciate: he boasts a complete and refined game, his presence makes his team better on both ends, his scoring game is multi-dimensional and efficient, he’s a premier perimeter defender, he’s a proven playoff performer, he’s painstakingly worked to eliminate his weaknesses, and his game would easily mesh with any cast of teammates. Leonard is a perennial MVP candidate, he’s the best player in Raptors history even though he hasn’t played a game yet, and he would be the best teammate LeBron James has ever had if he joins the Lakers next summer. In short, he was a 20+ points per game scorer and very nearly a 50/40/90 shooter in the same year he won 2016 Defensive Player of the Year. That is the definition of immense value on the hardwood.Clearly, there’s a major “but…” coming now. But, at this moment in his career, Leonard finds himself needing to reestablish a quality that is essential to leadership and winning: reliability. This is a question of both health and demeanor. After playing just nine games last season, the 27-year-old Leonard has now missed 27% of his team’s regular-season games during his career. To make matters worse, he behaved in reprehensible fashion for a max-level franchise player throughout his injury absence, drawing soft rebukes and subliminal digs from his legendary coach and teammates. Regardless of what happened behind closed doors or on the training table, Leonard is solely responsible for months of poor communication, for his ill-fated “Spur for life” press conference, and for the distracting “Uncle Dennis” chatter. He’s solely responsible for leaving his teammates up in the air about his availability in the run-up to the playoffs and for staying away from the Spurs during the postseason. LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Anthony Davis would never behave like Leonard did because they understand and accept that being an A-list superstar requires comporting oneself like a chief executive.While James’s move to L.A. will garner 1,000 times more attention, Leonard’s arrival in Toronto is nearly as intriguing and arguably more influential on the 2019 title picture. Will Leonard take James’s place as the East’s best player and lead the Raptors to the Finals after so many postseason heartbreaks? Or, will Leonard’s silence and loud free-agency rumors doom Toronto like they did San Antonio? How will he adjust to life under a rookie head coach after seven years with Gregg Popovich? Will a potential Hall of Fame career that launched with such promise—a Finals MVP at age 22—get back on track or derail further? — BGGeorge (21.9 PPG, 5.7 RPG, 3.3 APG) is a great shooter in a league that runs on shooting, a choice defender for some of the most difficult matchups, and a flexible star at a time when amassing talent is the only real way to compete. Indiana gave George the opportunity to lead a team of his own, which only led him to relish a day he didn’t have to. He is a star built for these times—both fully capable of taking a team over the top and fully aware of how much help it takes to win.Playing in Oklahoma City works for him. George does his best work when he doesn’t have to handle the ball on every possession, which is never really a problem with Russell Westbrook around. Both operate in ways that make the other’s job easier: Westbrook’s shot creation is a relief to George, who can do more of his work off the ball. Meanwhile, George is enough of a draw that a defense can’t just load up against Westbrook’s drives. One pushes, the other pulls.In truth, George could have that kind of basketball relationship with any number of stars around the league. Good fits come naturally when a scorer of George’s caliber doubles as an elite spot-up shooter. All sorts of lineups make sense when George can defend the best player across three positions. Any rotation can work when you know that George, who is perennially among the league leaders in minutes played, can handle a massive workload. If anything, George made the balance of playing between Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony look easier than it was. George’s greatest talent—among many—may be how easily he covers up the seams. — RMNew conference, new organization, new teammates, same Butler (22.2 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 4.9 APG). A stunning 2017 Draft-day trade to Minnesota placed the relentless 28-year-old wing in the savior role for a franchise that hadn’t made the postseason since 2004. He promptly delivered on the playoff mandate, earning his fourth All-Star selection in addition to All-NBA Third Team and All-Defensive Second Team honors. In terms of measurable impact, few superstars have rivaled Butler in recent years: he ranked fourth in Real Plus-Minus, he played a leading role in lifting Minnesota’s offensive rating to fourth in the NBA, his presence on the court swung Minnesota’s net rating by a whopping 12.8 points, and his team nearly fell to pieces when he missed more than a month with a late-season knee injury.Butler, like Russell Westbrook, predicates his game on force of will. When he arrived in Minnesota, there was hope that he would pair with Andrew Wiggins to form one of the league’s top perimeter duos. Instead, the two wings emerged in sharp contrast: If Wiggins’s empty minutes were a watery broth, Butler’s were a chunky stew. Butler seeks out the heavy lifting, whether it’s drawing contact to force his way to the foul line, hawking the opposition’s best player, or taking control of the offense late in close games. His methods work—to a point.  With Butler on the court, the Timberwolves were tracking to the West’s No. 3 seed, going 37-22 (a 51-win clip). Without him, they went 10-13 (a 36-win pace) and certainly would have been lottery-bound.But turning over a franchise to Butler is a bargain with strings attached. His all-gas, no-brakes style of play has caused him to miss an average of 15 games over the past five years, and his biting impatience with his teammates has generated problematic headlines in Chicago and Minnesota. The former role player has completely rewired himself as an alpha scorer since his breakout 2014-15 season, but there are real questions about how far he can carry a team in the playoffs. Butler has advanced in the postseason just once since rising to stardom, and he will need to make it through the regular season unscathed from a health standpoint if he wants to win a series in the West.Comparing Butler and Paul George is annually one of this list’s toughest calls, given their quality two-way games and similar accomplishments. While Butler is a more effective No. 1 option thanks to his punishing style and playmaking ability, George is the superior outside shooter, fits more cleanly alongside star players as an elite No. 2, and has enjoyed better health. Ultimately, the quality of Butler’s minutes won out: he beat out George in PER, Win Shares, Real Plus-Minus and WARP while playing a more central role in his team’s success. If Butler’s injury issues resurface, though, he will be headed for a tumble in next year’s rankings. — BGIt’s rare to see a player already in the running for Defensive Player of the Year developing at such a rapid rate. Embiid (22.9 PPG, 11.0 RPG, 3.2 APG) is a sponge. The nuances of professional play are still so new to him, yet instinct guides Embiid to positions of particular impact. He has a natural aptitude for rotation, which involves reading the floor and timing out plays as they progress. Opponents are terrified of him, which buys Embiid time; players take such a wide berth around him and use so many pump fakes that Embiid has a longer window than most to get where he needs to go. Even at this stage, he all but guarantees an elite defense. Imagine how good Embiid could be when he actually knows what he’s doing.It’s that trajectory that makes Embiid, who stands to improve more than any other player in our Top 10, so difficult to rank. Anthony Davis and Giannis Antetokounmpo could add to their games, but not so much as a center with limited experienced in organized basketball set to play his third NBA season. There are still noticeable hitches in Embiid’s game that could be ironed out, from the way he deals with double teams to his gutsy shot selection  his carelessness with the ball. Embiid is a thoroughly dominant work in progress, which should come as a terrifying prospect to the rest of the league. There are few players capable of credibly guarding Embiid as it is. Things could really take a turn as his play elevates; we’re not far from Eastern Conference contenders stocking some big-bodied “Embiid stopper” by necessity.The caveat to all this, of course, is Embiid’s health. We have yet to see him play more than 63 games in a season, which came in what was easily Embiid’s healthiest campaign to date. It helps his case that so many other top players (Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, and Jimmy Butler, in particular) tend to miss between 15 and 20 games on average. Their own injury histories work as an equalizer. There’s more worry with Embiid because of his size and the chronic nature of his injuries, but this lists forecasts for a single season based off the healthiest Embiid has ever been. Allow, at least, for the possibility that the Sixers can be cautious with Embiid and still have him in uniform for around 65 games. — RMThe implicit framing of the Top 100 is this: Who are the players who really matter in the games that matter most? Paul (18.6 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 7.9 APG) jumps near the top of the list—not because he happens to play for one of the best teams in the league, but because he’s exactly the kind of player you want involved when your season is on the line. Houston knows this well, having built a 3-2 series lead against the Warriors thanks to Paul’s gutsy play and then having dropped the last two games of the series in his absence. On the one hand, Paul’s tendency to pick up injuries clearly works against him. On the other, Paul is still operating at such an incredible level that some missed time is tolerable. You make do when a player is operating this close to an MVP level, even if he misses 24 games along the way.Paul earns this standing with the way he picks apart opponents. What a miserable thing it must be to step up, as a big man, against one of Paul’s pick-and-rolls. React to any of Paul’s feints and he’ll rock back into an easy mid-range jumper. Try to play it cool and he’ll drive past you, winding around the court in search of any vulnerability. Paul is such a high-level passer and defender that his one-on-one brilliance somehow went unnoticed. No more. Houston’s offense reached its historic heights in part because Paul can almost always get his, a genuine rarity among guards his size. Even though he plays alongside another great passer in James Harden, only 15% of Paul’s field goals last season were assisted.It was because of that creative strength that the Rockets could stagger the minutes of their two best players, overwhelming opponents with 48 minutes of offensive pressure. Paul’s approach is quite different than Harden’s, but he runs similar lineups to great effect. For one, he scored as much on a per-minute basis as at any point in his career—even while barely getting to the rim or the free throw line. More important is that Paul always seems to know which levers to pull for the best possible result. Houston’s system relies on Paul ability to generate offense for himself, but he’s always at his most comfortable orchestrating for others—guiding his teammates into scoring positions and mismatches that best fit the moment.There’s no real substitute for that level of situational awareness, which enables Paul to function effectively in any lineup and in any style. There is no matchup on earth that could play him off the court, or even make him a mark. Target Paul at your own risk. This is a guard who can hang with Kevin Durant on the block in a pinch, and who can go shimmy for shimmy with Steph Curry. No matter the challenge, Paul is game to compete. — RMNote: Westbrook’s rank was determined before the announcement of his most recent knee surgery. Say what you will about Westbrook, but the man shows up. When his team’s season is on the brink, Westbrook will take every damn shot necessary to keep things afloat. While other players awkwardly feel out the dynamic of a playoff series, Westbrook charges in, forcing everyone on the court to respond to him. It’s almost incomprehensible that someone who drives as hard as Westbrook could be as healthy as he’s been prior to undergoing knee surgery this week. Durability is a skill in itself, and Westbrook—even as his legend grows—doesn’t get nearly enough credit for his availability in the wake of hard fouls, harder falls, and freaking dents in the side of his face.Simply employing Westbrook gives a team an unquestionable identity. No superstar in the league brings such consistent effort; although there are plenty of faults to find in Westbrook’s approach, you could never accuse him of coasting. Teammates tend to follow suit, giving the entire outfit a relentless, combative style. If you’re not ready to play, Westbrook will run you off the court. It’s perfectly understandable why some stars would pace themselves for the playoffs, though there’s value in a player like Westbrook bringing force to every game of the regular season.There remains some debate, however, as to what far-reaching effects Westbrook’s style might have on a roster. For any one player to dominate so many of his team’s possessions must come at a cost. Westbrook is similar to LeBron in that way. Playing alongside either can be a great gig for a specialist. The more narrow your game, the more Westbrook can do for you. Dynamic players, however, don’t always have the easiest time fitting in. Westbrook takes up so much oxygen that he makes it hard for other players to really blossom. It’s not exactly a coincidence that the Thunder never really seem to know how to function without him. Westbrook is such a force of game and personality that he becomes completely integral. If his team struggles without him, it’s in part because he made it that way.The good with Westbrook far outweighs the bad, but with his style comes a certain ceiling. Playoff teams can turn his ferocity against him. Defense still seems like an exhibition to Westbrook, a battle between players rather than teams. Patience—the primary currency of postseason problem solving—isn’t exactly his strong suit. And it’s all because Westbrook, for better or worse, only knows one way to play. — RMIt’s easy to get distracted by Milwaukee's lack of playoff progress or lose sight of the big picture after watching his impossible highlights for three years, so here’s a simple, zoomed-out reminder: Antetokounmpo (26.9 PPG, 10 RPG, 4.8 APG) is the best story in basketball. At 18, he was a nobody whose Greek league games were captured only on grainy video. At 19, he was drafted outside the lottery and spent his rookie season looking lost. By 22, he had cracked the All-Star and All-NBA teams and was named Most Improved Player. Now, at 23, Antetokounmpo is a certified global sensation, finishing sixth in 2018 MVP voting, drawing nearly as many All-Star votes as LeBron James, earning a signature shoe deal from Nike, and getting the full feature treatment from 60 Minutes.The longer one marinates on Antetokounmpo’s impossible rise, the more it feels like he’s won the NBA version of Powerball four times in a row. There is one major difference: Antetokounmpo’s extreme good fortune has been supplemented by extreme diligence to his craft. Step by step, Antetokounmpo has built himself into an alpha scorer by honing his ball-handling skills, committing to an attack mentality, living on the free-throw line, learning how to use his length to generate high-quality looks around the basket, and adding strength so that he can finish over and through anyone in the league. Indeed, nearly half of Antetokounmpo’s shot attempts last season came from within three feet, and he finished more than 75% of them. “He’s impossible to guard,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said during the playoffs, with evident admiration and a shake of his head.It’s only going to get worse for Stevens and his fellow coaches. Antetokounmpo’s feel as a playmaker has room to improve, as does Milwaukee’s spacing around him. The Bucks ranked seventh in offense last season, and they have the potential to be a top-three unit during Antetokounmpo’s prime years if they can consistently surround him with four shooters and get him loose in the open court more often. Of course, there’s also the persistent hope that Antetokounmpo can extend his range, which at present includes a passable mid-range game and limited three-point proficiency. Antetokounmpo with a trustworthy jumper would be a whole new flavor of impossible.In both his offensive strengths and limitations, Antetokounmpo somewhat resembles the man behind him on this list, Russell Westbrook. Although the Thunder’s point guard has gaudier individual stats and significantly more playoff success, Antetokounmpo is the more complete player thanks to his defensive impact and versatility. At this point, Westbrook’s massive offensive role comes packaged with major compromises in consistency and discipline on the other end. Not so for Antetokounmpo, who switches comfortably through four positions, competes hard on the defensive glass, and contests shots in the basket area more effectively than many starting centers. The bet here is that Antetokounmpo’s sharp ascent will continue with a 2019 postseason breakthrough, turning what is now a tight debate between him and Westbrook into a much easier call by next September. — BGThere’s a case to be made for Davis (28.1 PPG, 11.1 RPG, 2.3 APG) as the third- or fourth-best player in the league, and it goes like this: No other player—not LeBron James, not Kevin Durant, not anyone—is so consistently dominant on both sides of the ball. Davis could win Defensive Player of the Year while leading the league in scoring. He could be the captain of a top-five offense, the anchor of a top-five defense, or both. We’re nearing the pantheon days of Davis’s career—the beginning of his entry as an all-time great player, beginning with his MVP candidacy in the season to come.The pushback is largely a matter of respecting accomplishment. Stephen Curry and James Harden not only have all the markers of elite play, but a deeper superstar body of work and the postseason receipts to validate it. You don’t wave off two of the best offensive players in NBA history just because Davis is better than he’s ever been. A certain level of respect is owed—particularly when both Curry and Harden do so much to make their teammates’ lives easier.If there is any slight against Davis, it’s that his position makes it hard for him to touch as many possessions as a player like Curry or Harden. Guards who can initiate offense will always be slightly more accessible. Passing gives both a direct means of influencing a play’s outcome, to say nothing of the gravity they exert idly. Davis doesn’t really have that in his game, and that’s fine; allowing others to handle the ball frees Davis of the responsibility, allowing him to instead use his speed to its greatest advantage. Opposing bigs are at a loss when they’re forced to chase Davis, a 6’10” gazelle, around staggered screens to contest his jumper. You can use Davis in all the ways you’d use a high-scoring wing, save that he also has the face-up game to rule the mid-post and the finishing ability to dominate out of the pick-and-roll. There is very little on a basketball court that Davis can’t do.Part of what makes Davis so widely useful is that his shots are so difficult to contest. There aren’t many players who can meet Davis at the rim and make any kind of difference. When he goes to the block, he can’t be pushed around. Davis is taller and stronger than most of the players who guard him, and he understands how to put space between himself and his defender. How can one even combat that? To guard Davis is, really, to be at his mercy. You could transplant his skill set to any roster in the league and find room for him to thrive. Any coach running any system could build its concepts around Davis. His stardom is situation agnostic, and completely undeniable. — RMThe signature moment of his first MVP campaign came in late-February, when Harden (30.4 PPG, 5.4 RPG, 8.8 APG) set up one of his trademark step-back threes with a between-the-legs dribble that sent Wesley Johnson to the floor. While the Clippers forward scrambled to collect his limbs like he had just lost a game of “Twister,” Harden paused, relaxed his shoulders, and spun the ball while looking at his latest helpless victim. His body language screamed: “What are you doing down there?” Harden then proceeded to drain the three to complete the most emasculating highlight of the season.Harden has been an All-NBA level player and one of the league’s premier scoring threats for years now, but last season saw the 29-year-old guard at his most diabolical. With a new superstar playmaking partner, shooters on all sides, and an excellent lob finisher in the middle, Harden had everything he needed to carve up defenses with his ultra-efficient diet of threes, free throws and lay-ups. He tortured defenders like Johnson in isolation with his methodical crossovers, alternating between his hop-back jumpers, gliding runners, whizzing crosscourt passes and soft-touch alley-oops.When the dust settled, Harden ranked first in scoring, first in PER, first in Win Shares, first in free throws made, first in three-pointers made, second in Real Plus-Minus, and second in WARP. He led the league with 11 40-point games, four 50-point games and a 60-point game. Meanwhile, his Rockets set a franchise-record with a league-best 65 wins, ranking first in point differential and second in offensive efficiency while missing their first Finals trip since 1995 by one win. That breadth of high-level achievement is only possible when a methodically-constructed machine has years to address its weaker links and fine-tune its output.A full and fair review of the Rockets’ 2018 postseason would note that they breezed through the Timberwolves and Jazz as Harden, who had three 40-point games in the postseason, and Chris Paul took turns wreaking havoc. Additionally, Houston gutted out a pair of tight wins over Golden State in the West finals, with Harden scoring 30 points on the road in Game 4 to right the ship after an ugly blowout.For most observers, though, those accomplishments—which represented clear progress from previous postseason runs—were easily forgotten in the wake of Houston’s disastrous Game 7 collapse. Harden’s critics now had “Houston missed 27 straight threes” to add next to “2-11 in Game 6 against San Antonio” and the other demerits on his uneven postseason résumé.Although their agonizing Game 7 meltdown was impossible to explain, Harden and the Rockets left this season with proof that their approach was good enough to win a title. They pushed the Stephen Curry/Kevin Durant Warriors much harder than any other playoff opponent had over the past two years, and Harden performed with greater ease, stability and effect against Golden State’s defense than he had in the 2015 West finals. LeBron James has a higher basketball IQ and displays greater consistency in the playoffs than Harden, Durant is a more complete two-way player, and Curry is one of the few stars in league history whose individual offense can translate to more efficient team play. Those three aside, Harden has fashioned himself into basketball’s most dangerous weapon. — BGYou know the standards with Curry (26.4 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 6.1 APG) are well and truly out of control when a 50-40-90 championship season is met with a collective yawn. This is just par for the course when you’re the superstar at the heart of one of the greatest teams of all time, not to mention the very reason for that team’s existence. Kevin Durant would not have come to the Warriors if not for Curry. It was the environment that Curry had helped foster that enticed Durant in the first place, and it was Curry’s willingness to accommodate Durant that sealed the deal. A dynastic team was born because Curry is exceptional even among superstars.When Curry has been on the court during the Steve Kerr era, the Warriors are 244-45 (.844)—a perpetual 69-win pace. That’s four straight years of winning more than players like Harden or Davis ever have, all while the Warriors shuffled through centers, retooled their bench, and dealt with Kerr’s extended absence. Curry isn’t solely responsible for that success, but he is driving it. One can develop a deep appreciation for Curry by watching how the Warriors play without him; there’s too much talent in Golden State for things to turn disastrous, but Curry’s absence reveals all the subtle ways in which he makes championship play look easy. For starters, even a well-drawn offense doesn’t have the same juice without Curry’s involvement. The other Warriors move and screen and pass, but in the end so many of their sets are split cuts and fury, signifying nothing.It’s Curry that takes a good thing and makes it special. Every action that Golden State runs comes with implicit threat of Curry’s three-point shooting. When he doesn’t have the ball in his hands, he’s curling in a way so that he could possibly receive it. Most defenses still don’t know what to do with themselves. You can try to deny him, but Curry is quick to set a screen whenever he feels cornered—a simple action that can immediately throw the defense into disarray. Should any other defender help to contain him, Golden State will reverse course to find the open man as quickly as possible. Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system, but again: it’s the particulars in Curry’s game that make it viable. The entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn’t need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation. — RMDuring the premiere of his new barbershop talk show, LeBron James marveled to Snoop Dogg about the rapper’s uncanny ability to maintain his popularity through reinvention for more than 20 years. That particular skill has eluded Durant (26.4 PPG, 6.8 RPG, 5.4 APG), James’s biggest on-court rival, even as the 29-year-old Warriors forward has reached the apex of his Hall of Fame career. Branded a snake and a bandwagoner for leaving Oklahoma City to join Golden State in 2016, Durant has struggled to shake those labels despite winning two titles, making two iconic three-pointers in the Finals, and claiming two Finals MVPs.Indeed, the relative ease of Durant’s two Finals victories over James has only hardened the resentment. Instead of receiving the relief and validation that rings usually convey to superstars, Durant can’t seem to escape the “asterisk” talk, Superteam envy, and accusations of sensitivity. He’s tried a little bit of everything—donating millions to charity, appearing in commercials for tech companies, criticizing the president, launching a YouTube channel, speaking candidly in multiple long-form podcast interviews, taking the high road by giving intentionally bland press conferences, forsaking the high road by responding directly to his critics and opponents on Twitter—and yet his image is as polarized as ever.This is all a terrible shame. Durant is playing the best basketball of his career and some of the best basketball the NBA has ever seen. Even as Golden State coasted through a lackluster regular season, Durant performed like an MVP candidate, placing in the top 10 by PER, Win Shares and WARP, nearly shooting 50/40/90 for the NBA’s No. 1 offense, and ranking fifth in blocks while garnering some early-season Defensive Player of the Year buzz. When Stephen Curry was sidelined due to injury, Durant ramped up his offensive initiation and playmaking duties. The results weren’t always pretty, but Golden State scored more than enough when it mattered, going 5-1 without Curry to open the postseason.In the West finals, Durant was cast as the scapegoat for Golden State’s choppy offensive execution, with critics blaming his isolation looks for interrupting Curry’s free-flowing style. This was a truly uncomfortable place to be—stuck between a beloved franchise icon and his adoring fanbase—yet Durant responded with 34 points in a Game 7 road win over Houston. The opportunity to get defensive, check out and pick a new team in free agency was right there on a platter in late May. Instead, he collected himself and eliminated James for the second straight June, scoring 43 points in a Game 3 road win and finishing off the sweep with his first career postseason triple-double.  The flak that rained down during the Rockets series resulted from two years of pent-up anger. Durant’s ball-stopping and off shooting nights were the first serious signs of vulnerability since the Hamptons 5 formed, and a Houston upset could have had cataclysmic off-season ramifications for Golden State. Durant brushed aside the growing mob by continuing to be the unguardable scoring machine he’s been for most of his career. The Rockets, who admitted to an “obsession” with the Warriors, had no chance at stopping him or even keeping him away from his favorite spots. They were left hoping Durant would miss. Same for the Cavaliers, who had even less of a chance given their weaker perimeter personnel.Sure, Durant on the Warriors is unfair. But Durant—with his determination, focus, length, smooth stroke, solid handle, high release point, deep range, hesi pull-up jimbos, well-honed fakes, ability to hit turnarounds over either shoulder, and killer late-game mentality—is unfair, period.For the sixth time in this list’s six-year history, Durant finished second to James. In truth, he did everything he needed to do to stake a strong claim to the No. 1 spot. James, thanks to a magnificent postseason run, just did everything he needed to do to hold Durant at bay one more time. — BGAs James (27.5 PPG, 8.6 RPG, 9.1 APG) has waded into political and social justice issues, expanded his philanthropic endeavors, launched a budding entertainment empire, and positioned himself as one of the country’s most visible fathers, he’s taken to wearing and sharing a new motto: “More than an athlete.” The 14-time All-Star and aspiring billionaire knows the financial and emotional power of catchy slogans and hashtags— from “Just do it” to “Strive for Greatness” to “Kid from Akron”—and this latest entry will serve him well as he prepares to shift out of his prime and grow his net worth in L.A.Make no mistake: James is more than an athlete, but he’s still the NBA’s most outstanding, most valuable and most awe-inspiring athlete. He shook the league by leaving the Cavaliers for a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers in July, he helped open a public school in his hometown, he will sell untold warehouses full of yellow No. 23 jerseys, and he will dominate headlines, magazine covers and trending topics all season long. But when the term “celebrity athlete” is used to describe him, the emphasis should remain on the second word rather than the first. His immense basketball intelligence, extraordinary skill, unprecedented longevity as an elite player, and capacity for raising his game in the postseason and in late-game moments demand it.  Basketball historians will look back in 20 years and lament the fact that James, now 33, has just four MVPs to show for his decade-plus of dominance. Last season was another potential MVP that got away; While James Harden was a worthy winner, James had a strong case too. He played all 82 games, led the league in minutes, and carried Cleveland to 50 wins despite two roster overhauls and multiple long-term injuries to his fellow starters. Individually, he ranked in the top-three in PER, Win Shares and WARP. Although he downshifted his night-to-night effort on defense, he was the determining factor between wins and losses as often as anyone in the game. James led Cleveland to a 30-15 record in games that were decided by five points or fewer in the final five minutes, and he ranked first league-wide in clutch points, second in clutch plus-minus, third in clutch assists, and fourth in clutch rebounds.Before a flat ending against a clearly superior opponent, James’s 2018 postseason was a mini-movie. He led the playoffs in PER, Win Shares, minutes, points, shots, free throws and assists, compiling averages of 34.0 PPG, 9.1 RPG, 9.0 APG. During 22 games, he tallied eight 40-point games, four triple-doubles, multiple buzzer-beating game-winners, his first full 48-minute playoff game since he was 21 years old, and the first 50-point game in the Finals since Michael Jordan in 1993.Those two months of basketball featured raw emotion when he jumped on the scorer’s table after drilling a three to beat the Pacers. They featured exquisite skill when he nailed a running banker to beat the Raptors. They featured remarkable will when he posted 35 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists on the road to outlast the Celtics in Game 7. And they featured perhaps the most visible agony of his career when his Game 1 for the ages was undone by J.R. Smith’s blunder.James tops this list, for the sixth time in its six-year history, because there’s no other active player who could match all the achievements listed above. And because there’s only one other basketball player in history who had the capacity to strike all the chords listed above. Like Michael Jordan before him, James the athlete will eventually be eclipsed by his own legend. But as he prepares to lead a new team of prospects and misfits in a fame-obsessed metropolis, it’s clear that time hasn’t yet come. — BGGEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five?

This NBA list ranks all of the league's current standout top players and NBA stars currently playing. It's common to see lists of the greatest basketball players of all time, but considerably more difficult to consider athletes' relative strengths while their careers are still ongoing. Looking back on the career of a Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, or Magic Johnson once it's complete, there are many factors to consider: number of championships, overall contribution to great teams, even just looking at the statistics. But who can say while an athlete still plays whether their good years are in front of them or behind? And harder still to compare their merits in comparison to other players who may be injured, have overall less experience playing professionally or are just going through a slump.This list attempts to sort through all the NBA's most popular and famous current all stars to find the most talented, and the players who are the most essential to have on a winning team to truly determine who is the best active player in the NBA today. LeBron James and Stephen Curry, two of the most iconic and celebrated players to ever compete, dominated in the early rankings, but a number of other challengers for the title—such as Houston Rockets phenom James Harden and the legendary Russell Westbrook—have become favorites as well.Who's the best player in the NBA today?

Sports Illustrated‘s annual Top 100 list is back, aiming to answer that question.This year, the rankings were determined holistically by a panel of NBA writers—Chris Herring, Rohan Nadkarni, Michael Pina and Jeremy Woo—through a combination of data and subjective evaluation. (As far as the content of those discussions is concerned, consider the first rule of Fight Club.) The goal remains to evaluate players in a vacuum as much as possible, without overvaluing team context in taking stock of their quality.To be clear, these rankings are specifically for the upcoming season and do not take into account players’ long-term prospects or career arcs beyond 2021-22. As has been the tradition here, rookies were not considered. So it’s best to consider these rankings as short-term value projections. This is not a representation of a player’s trade value or contract value, and it does not account for the impact of his salary relative to his production. The possibility of growth or decline are factors, tied to players’ age and career stage. The list attempts to account for the entirety of a player’s impact: offense, defense, structural or otherwise, and tends to favor those with the most malleable skill-sets.Availability due to injury and the ensuing recovery process are also factors here: this year, Kawhi Leonard, Jamal Murray and Klay Thompson were most affected in that way. The biggest snubs from this year’s list can be found here.For further reference, explore SI.com’s Top 100 lists from 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

SI TOP 100: Read 100-51, 50-31 and 30-11Jerome Miron/USA TODAY Sports10. Kawhi Leonard, Los Angeles Clippers (Previous rank: 3)If 100% healthy heading into this season instead of nursing a torn ACL, Kawhi Leonard would’ve likely finished top three on this list. Before he churned through another robotically superb stretch of playoff basketball (during which he led the entire field with a 30.6 PER and, with the Clippers’ backs against the wall, turned out an iconic 45-point showpiece in Game 6 against the Mavericks), Leonard was his typically efficient self, barely missing entry into the 50/40/90 club by a hair. When healthy, his general adaptability is such a convenience. Leonard neatly fits in any lineup, playing any position, filling any role. It’d be wise to give him the ball and let him dictate every offensive possession, but he doesn’t need it in his hands to impact the game positively. He rebounds. He defends (extraordinarily well, still). He reigns over every square inch his wingspan allows him to with as much ferocity as anyone in the sport. Alas, Leonard may not play a minute this season, which complicates his placement on a list like this. But so long as he’s included, it doesn’t make much sense to drop anyone who soared as high as Leonard recently did out of the top 10. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated9. Anthony Davis, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 7)Davis fulfilled his potential in the bubble in 2020 with a dominant run that resulted in his first championship. He averaged 27.7 points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game, with a silly 66.5 true shooting percentage that, when combined with his versatility on defense, made him as valuable as any player on the planet. (The Lakers outscored opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions with Davis on the floor and were outscored by 8.9 points per 100 possessions when he sat, the widest differential on the team.)If he followed that stretch up with an entire season’s worth of similar production, Davis would in all likelihood rank No. 1 on this list. Instead, he had the most disappointing year of his career, with a statistical chasm unseen since his rookie year. Injuries played a role, as did an unprecedentedly brief offseason.His mid-range shot was inconsistent, albeit relied upon more than any other time since he was drafted. He took fewer shots at the rim and didn’t aggressively seek trips to the free throw line as frequently as someone so physically imposing probably should. The thing is: A down Davis year is still better than 99% of his contemporaries’ best. At only 28 years old, there’s no reason why he won’t bounce back. Generational talents tend not to lick their wounds for very long. — MPErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated8. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers(Previous rank: 10)When he is at his best, there is nobody in the league who can match up with Embiid. His combination of size, strength, power and touch is the antidote to the spacey style of modern basketball. Embiid is a dominant low force presence in a league continuously less familiar with those types of players. And in addition to his prowess on the block, last season Embiid turned in a stellar performance as a midrange shooter. The increase in efficiency from the midrange plus excising lazy threes led to the best scoring average and field-goal percentage of Embiid’s career. On the other end of the floor, Embiid’s presence in the paint all but guarantees a top-flight defense. Even if he’s not the type to switch onto guards, Embiid is still more than capable of sticking with smaller lineups—particularly when he’s in great shape. If there’s anything holding Embiid back from winning more individual accolades—and a higher spot on this list—it’s his health. Injuries are a persistent problem for Embiid, even if he was willing to battle through a torn meniscus during the Sixers’ most recent playoff run. On any given night, Embiid can be the best basketball player in the world. He’s a unique two-way force, and there’s still room for more once he finally plays on a roster optimized for him. — RNErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated7. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 4)Harden, when accounting for injuries and level of responsibility, is perhaps the most consistent volume scorer of his era. Even in 2021, when Harden averaged his fewest points since 2012, he remained one of the most feared scorers in the world. There is nuance to the way Harden collects his points despite his never ending quest for threes, layups and free throws. He’s deeply knowledgeable at using his body and leveraging his physicality to create space. Harden’s herky jerky movements are calculated, all part of a delicate dance to put his defender off balance. Harden’s footwork is so precise the moment he senses vulnerability he can pull into his shooting motion. Harden’s methods are undeniably effective. And in Brooklyn, he showed he didn’t have to rely on his scoring prowess to be effective. Harden earnestly took on the role of point guard for the Nets, and he delivered by racking up nearly 11 assists a night. Harden was a willing passer and table setter for a team that could let him isolate more comfortably than any one before it. If there’s a hole in Harden’s game, it’s on the defensive end, where he’s never been confused for a stopper. Still, his shortcomings there are a small price to pay for what else he brings to the table. Harden may never get a chance to prove he’s the proverbial “best guy on a championship team.” But if you pair him with anybody else in the top 20, you instantly have a contender. — RNGreg Nelson/Sports Illustrated6. Luka Dončić, Dallas Mavericks(Previous rank: 9)It stands to reason the 22-year-old Dončić may one day inherit the top spot on this list, as he continues on an all-time great trajectory. He’s prolific in every facet as a full-time offensive engine, with the size and pace to create mismatches in lieu of elite quickness, preternatural scoring know-how, and ingenious passing and processing speed. It’s not a bad bet that he may eventually average a triple-double … and he’s only been in the league for three seasons.The Mavericks are still working to build a championship-caliber core around Dončić, and there are some areas of individual improvement to watch for in the interim. Despite taking a lot of difficult shots, he upped his three-point clip to a respectable 35% last season, which should trend up over time. He’s capable of better than 73% from the foul line, and he gets there plenty. Upping his efficiency along those margins, coupled with any reduction in turnovers (which are a byproduct of how often he has the ball) will take him to the stratosphere, statistically speaking. It seems foregone Dončić will eventually win an MVP regardless. The fact that nothing said here is exaggeration tells the story. He’s going to be here a long time. — JWWatch NBA games online all season long with fuboTV: Start with a 7-day free trial!Greg Nelson/Sports Illustrated5. Nikola Jokić, Denver Nuggets(Previous rank: 8)For all the talk of the unicorn era in the NBA that never quite was, what exactly are you supposed to call Jokić? Who was the last MVP who simply loved to pass and scored almost reluctantly all while flummoxing great players with his distinct lack of athleticism? Jokić is singular, and watching him play is one of the most fulfilling experiences for fans of fun basketball.Jokić is a threat to get a triple double every night. He’s got brilliant touch as a shooter, allowing him to pop for threes on pick-and-rolls or pull up for little midrange Js near the elbow. Jokić doesn’t bulldoze people in the post. Instead, he prefers to attack with a flurry of moves before finding the perfect angle on the backboard while uncorking a shot from a comically awkward position. Of course, he’s a much better passer, keeping the Nuggets’ offense humming and constantly throwing players into open spots on the floor. Jokić’s passing isn’t only aesthetically pleasing or some kind of nerd cred test; it’s genuinely a boon to Denver’s attack, allowing them to pick up buckets most other teams can’t.For years now, Jokić has been one of the most impactful offensive beings in the NBA. His defense will never be elite, though a decent enough one can be built around him. What matters more is that Jokić’s rare set of skills not only continue to raise his own game to new heights, it raises those around him as well. — RNJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated4. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors(Previous rank: 5)No matter what happens next, Curry is going down as the most prolific shooter ever. He’s on pace to pass Ray Allen for the top spot on the career threes leaderboard, and sits a hair above Steve Nash for the best free throw percentage of all time. And he just put together the highest scoring average of his career, posting 32 points per game at age 32, while playing through injury. There’s essentially no assailing what Curry has accomplished, and his ubiquitous style of play has aged gracefully. Nobody else bends defenses as blatantly, and whether or not the ball happens to be in his hands is not the problem. The three-point revolution already happened, and the copycats are still coming—a direct product of Golden State’s championships—but no guard will ever do exactly what Curry does, or replicate the style with which he does it.The Warriors did fall short in the play-in round, and it’s now been two seasons since they made the playoffs. Provided Curry can maintain optimal health, it’s hard to think that streak will last. His effortless range, clever finishes and discerning IQ are as sharp as ever, and there’s a strong argument for him as the most individually skilled player in the whole league. He’ll require additional defensive insulation as he enters his mid-30s. But Curry will always be the guy you want shooting the ball when it counts, and looks poised to extend his run atop the league’s guard hierarchy for as long as his body can handle it. — JWErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated3. LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers(Previous rank: 1)Someday LeBron, the most important, imposing and intelligent player of his (and possibly every other) generation, won’t crack this list’s top three. Even after a massively disappointing first-round dismissal (the first of his career) in which despite averaging 23.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 8.0 assists the 36-year-old actually looked mortal, that day isn’t this one.James doesn’t have the same athletic advantage he once did. And even though he’s a step slower, with the physical authority to control every square inch of the floor finally starting to fade, he’s still LeBron. Nobody anticipates live action more succinctly. Nobody analyzes whatever’s happening in their peripheral vision quicker, or makes a fast, ever complicated game look so elementary whether the ball is in their hands or not, on offense or the other end.Bet against him at your own peril. If and when healthy (a more significant caveat every year) James is still a paragon of basketball expertise. — MPJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated2. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks(Previous rank: 2)Antetokounmpo, a reigning NBA champion and winner of two out of the last three league MVPs, presents the strongest case for No. 1 outside of Durant. Giannis isn’t the most fluid scorer. But who else can give you nearly 30 a night—and 50 in a Finals clincher—while setting up teammates a half dozen times per game, while also scorching opponents in transition and playing some of the best, most versatile help defense in the league at 7 feet tall? No one but Giannis does that. And he’s done it while staying relatively healthy for a superstar. His ability to quickly bounce back from one of the uglier knee hyperextensions you’ll ever see changed the course of basketball history, and earned the Bucks a title. That shouldn’t be taken for granted. — CHErick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated1. Kevin Durant, Brooklyn Nets(Previous rank: 6)After he spent the entire 2019-20 season recovering from a torn Achilles, Durant’s peak ability was called into question for the first time in his career. At 32 years old, would the four-time scoring champion bounce back and look exactly like he did when we saw him last—which is to ask, could he again be one of the world’s two or three best players?Durant’s regular season was disrupted by a strained left hamstring and left thigh contusion, then overshadowed by a blockbuster trade for James Harden. But in the 35 games he did play, KD looked like the same guy, with a statistical profile that either matched or exceeded most of his career averages.Then the playoffs happened. In them, Durant submitted the most impressive series of his career, averaging a hyper-efficient 35.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 5.4 assists against the Bucks, eventual world champs that had zero answer for his excellence. It was pantheon worthy, and made debate over if we’ve ever seen a more ruthless iteration completely justifiable. When the dust settled, his place at the top became a universal truth. Anyone who wants to lobby for another candidate can just ask Giannis Antetokounmpo. Standing on the court after he just eliminated Durant’s Nets in their own gym, the two-time MVP called his opponent “the best player in the world.” Who are we to argue? —MPMore NBA Coverage:Sports Illustrated may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.GEICO Nationals have arrived, headlined by No. 1 Sunrise Christian Academy.Duncanville state champ Ron Holland highlights five juniors who are shoo-ins for the game next season.Paul George scored 34 points in his return after missing three months and the Clippers rallied from a 25-point deficit to beat the Jazz on Tuesday.Bird: “There was a moment where I was like... ‘This might be your last half so let’s f---ing go.’”“I haven’t looked at it as us against North Carolina,” the Duke coach said in his press conference on Tuesday.Duke's Dereck Lively, Arkansas' Nick Smith Jr., others could lead teams to a deep run next March.How do you approach a match you can lose by five?

      "Who are the best players in the NBA entering the 2019-20 season?Several times per year, our Global NBA.com staff votes to determine the best players in the league. Given how perceptions change based on performance and context, it's a fluid discussion that changes significantly over the course of a season.A lot has changed since we last updated our player rankings following the Toronto Raptors' run to the NBA title. Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Paul George, Russell Westbrook, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker, Al Horford, Jimmy Butler, and Chris Paul are on new teams and there's been plenty of time to reflect on last season and project moving forward.Since Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson are out with significant injuries and will face major question marks whenever they eventually return, they were not considered for the purposes of this go-around.Before jumping into the top 30, we'd be remiss for not bringing up some of the biggest names that missed the cut. It's a testament to the overall talent pool that there are this many impact players who couldn't crack the top-30.In all, there were 12 players who received votes from our panel of nine voters but fell outside the top-30. Here they are in order of most to least:For quick reference, you can scroll to the bottom for a table with all 30 players ranked in order along with their stats from last year's regular season. As for the unveiling itself, you'll find three bits of info to go along with each name:The biggest stat... meant to illuminate a key number heading into the season or address an important narrative about that player.The biggest question... what's the biggest concern or unknown for each player heading into the season?The skinny...

Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee BucksAt long last, the moment (we hope) you've been waiting for has finally arrived: Our officially official ranking of the top 100 NBA players for the 2019-20 season is officially here. Officially.Before you journey down this rabbit hole with us, be sure to check out the position-by-position installments of our top-100 series if you haven't already:Players are being evaluated relative to their performance for this season only. Benefit of the doubt is awarded to stars with limited appearances, but only if they've delivered at a high level during their time on the floor or seem likely to pick up steam in Disney World or during the potential Chicago bubble.Anyone who hasn't logged at least 500 minutes is not eligible for inclusion. This makes for some tough cuts—Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Victor Oladipo, Klay Thompson, etc.—but this is, in essence, a 2019-20 retrospective. Sample size has to matter.Disagreements are inevitable. Which is fine. Friends argue sometimes. Just know that we didn't assemble this pecking order to upset you. Any villainy you detect is unintentional*.                 *For the most part.If not for injuries that limited their availability or cost them the entire season, each of these players would've received top-100 consideration:Cheer up, sadz-havers. And angry-pants-wearers.Steph is a top-five player in any normal season. KD will default to no lower than a top-10 player post-Achilles injury until proven otherwise. And pretty much everyone else on this list, with the exception of Bagley and Kennard, are 2020-21 preseason top-100 shoo-ins, barring any setbacks.These players were tough to leave off, and we very much hate ourselves:100. Donte DiVincenzo, Milwaukee BucksDonte DiVincenzo's basic numbers won't burn up your screen, but his impact on the powerhouse Milwaukee Bucks is clear.On the season, Milwaukee is plus-15.0 points per 100 possessions when Giannis Antetokounmpo plays with DiVincenzo and plus-12.3 when he doesn't.The reason for that uptick is DiVincenzo's gap-filling game. He does a little bit of everything, as evidenced by his 7.3 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.0 steals per 75 possessions.And while his 34.4 three-point percentage could use some work, his 57.0 true shooting percentage was above average thanks to his ability to finish inside.     99. T.J. Warren, Indiana PacersIn his first season with the Indiana Pacers, T.J. Warren has quickly established himself as perhaps the team's best scorer. In the rawest sense, his team-leading 18.7 points per game would suggest as much, though Domantas Sabonis' 18.5 aren't far behind. They're within a point of each other in the percentage of makes that are assisted, as well.What sets Warren apart, though, is his ability to both spread the floor (37.5 percent on 3.0 three-point attempts per game) and run some pick-and-roll. Nearly a fifth of his possessions come as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, and he's scoring at an above-average clip out of that play type.He still leaves plenty to be desired on the defensive end, but for a team that has been missing Victor Oladipo for most of the season, that from-scratch offense is valuable.  98. Derrick White, San Antonio SpursLineup politics have capped Derrick White's crack at appreciable progress. Dejounte Murray's return has relegated him to the bench, and San Antonio's quasi-refusal to play the two together comes at the expense of his minutes.White is not blameless in this dilemma. Like Murray and DeMar DeRozan, he is a limited weapon from distance. Playing all three at the same time is a non-option for an offense that already traffics in cluttered floor spacing. White has, however, shown the set touch necessary to warrant minutes beside Murray on an alternative, DeRozan-less version of the Spurs.More than 20 percent of his looks come as catch-and-fire threes, on which he's shooting 37.5 percent. Defenses are slightly less inclined to go under him in pick-and-rolls than they are Murray, and he's canning more than 50 percent of his twos despite seeing his efficiency drop around the rim.Even the most marginal offensive upticks moving forward would prove massive for White. He plays a brand of defense you feel while watching. His stands against superstar guards and wings are enviable—a tutorial in staying ahead of ball-handlers and not biting on fakes—and he blocks way more shots than any guard standing 6'4\" with unimpressive length should.  97. Duncan Robinson, Miami HeatThe easiest gripe to make about Duncan Robinson is that he doesn't do much at a high level beyond shoot. Well, when you shoot like this, that's not much of a gripe.Stephen Curry (2015-16) and Steve Novak (2011-12) are the only players in league history who have matched or exceeded Robinson's 2019-20 marks for volume (10.2 attempts per 75 possessions) and efficiency (44.8 percent) from three.Among players who have taken at least 500 shots from anywhere in a season, Robinson's otherworldly 66.5 effective field-goal percentage trails only a bunch of All-Star centers and 2014-15 Kyle Korver.He's been a flamethrower this season, and the Miami Heat have legitimately fallen apart when he isn't out there spacing the floor. They've been plus-8.8 points per 100 possessions when he's played and minus-4.9 when he sits, giving him a 13.7 net rating swing that ranks in the 99th percentile.Even if he doesn't dish out a ton of dimes or lock down the opposition's best player, the impact driven by his shooting is immense.   96. OG Anunoby, Toronto RaptorsOn the other end of the equation is Toronto Raptors wing OG Anunoby, a solid offensive player who contributes the bulk of his value on the defensive end.All season, Anunoby has been willing and able to spend time on the opposition's top offensive players. And Toronto's defense ranks in the 84th percentile when he's on the floor. His length, athleticism and switchability are reminiscent of some of the game's top defenders, which makes sense given his standout habits.\"Ron Artest, Scottie Pippen, Kawhi [Leonard], guys like that,\" Anunoby told reporters when asked who he patterns his defense after earlier this season. \"Draymond [Green].\"Those are ambitious targets, but Anunoby possesses the tools to get there, at least on the defensive end.Whether he can carry a bigger load offensively remains to be seen, but simply maintaining his three-point shooting from this season (38.1 percent on 3.4 attempts per game) would make him a prototypical three-and-D specialist.95. Caris LeVert, Brooklyn NetsContinued on-again, off-again availability is not the lone anchor holding down Caris LeVert. A right thumb kept him sidelined for two months, which doesn't help, but his elevated usage has coincided with a steep drop in efficiency.LeVert is shooting under 43 percent inside the arc while both reaching and finishing at the rim on a lower clip. Mid-range jumpers account for a larger share of his shot attempts, and he's not hitting nearly enough of them (35 percent) to justify the outsized share.The context of LeVert's role is his saving grace. Brooklyn's free-agency coup last summer has not translated to a tinier workload. Kevin Durant hasn't yet debuted for the Nets, and Kyrie Irving has missed most of the year. LeVert is still charged with a healthy amount of from-scratch creation, and he's holding his own.His effective field-goal percentage on pull-up jumpers (50.8) is higher than that from Jayson Tatum (50.3). His efficiency on unassisted threes is absurd. Among everyone launching at least three pull-up triples per game, no one touches LeVert's 41.5 percent success rate.That he's officially a trusted decision-maker out of the pick-and-roll props up his argument even more. He is one of six non-point guards clearing 17 points and four assists per game while draining more than 38 percent of his threes—evidence not of a breakout season but of his potential as a No. 3 on what the Nets hope will soon be a really good team.    94. Davis Bertans, Washington WizardsDavis Bertans doesn't do a whole lot on offense besides catch the basketball and shoot it. But when you're as good at that one thing (which happens to be the most important skill in basketball) as Bertans is, you don't need to do much more.Unleashed after three seasons in a much smaller role with the San Antonio Spurs, Bertans is averaging 15.4 points and 3.7 threes this season while shooting 42.4 percent from deep. Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who has matched or exceeded all three marks for a season (and he has done so twice).Those threes aren't garden-variety catch-and-shoots, either. His 45 makes from 28 feet and out trail only Damian Lillard, Trae Young and James Harden. And his percentage from that range (49.5) comfortably tops those three.Extend the range to 30-plus feet and Bertans trails only Lillard and Young. But here's the real kicker: He is an outrageous 18-of-26 (69.2 percent) on those shots.When defenses have to pay attention to a big that far from the hoop, it expands the floor for everyone else. On the season, the Washington Wizards have scored 121.7 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile) when Bertans shares the floor with Bradley Beal. They have scored 106.2 points per 100 possessions (19th percentile) when Beal is on the floor without Bertans.  93. Danny Green, Los Angeles LakersThough he hasn't been quite the impact juggernaut he was in 2018-19 when the Toronto Raptors' net rating was 17.4 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor, Danny Green has still been a clear positive for the Los Angeles Lakers.And of course, that impact once again comes from far more than scoring. Among the 147 players in NBA history with a 2.0-plus box plus/minus, Green is 136th in points per possession.In 2019-20, he's done all the same things that have carried that value throughout his career. He spreads the floor, hits threes at an above-average rate and is capable of bothering the top perimeter option from about any opponent.  92. Marcus Morris Sr., Los Angeles ClippersMarcus Morris Sr.'s final placement is a tale of two seasons. Free rein with the New York Knicks gave him a certain je ne sais quoi. The numbers were pretty, but they came on a bad team, in a role he would never hold with a better squad.Joining the Clippers, a real title contender, may be a more accurate gauge of his value. That doesn't bode well for him if the season is over. He's shooting 28.3 percent from beyond the arc and has seen his usage rate crater amid a much more talented offensive hierarchy.Judge his season in its totality and Morris still comes out on top. He's downing 38.3 percent of his pull-up treys and averaging a personal-best 19.9 points per 36 minutes on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. The question, as ever, is whether his offensive utility can spill over to a niche role in which he's predominantly a spot-up guy and only situationally tasked with creating off the dribble. His usefulness waxed and waned under similar circumstances in Boston last season, and nothing has changed in Los Angeles, where 75 percent of his made buckets are coming off assists.91. Mitchell Robinson, New York KnicksMitchell Robinson is a lean, mean, shot-blocking and rim-running machine who may be on track to becoming a more athletic Tyson Chandler.He's one of three players in NBA history to start his career with a 9.0-plus block percentage through his first two seasons, and his true shooting percentage is over 20 points higher than the other two.Sure, he's occasionally caught out of position and sometimes chases blocks at the expense of the scheme or a rebound, but he just turned 22. There is plenty of time for him to learn the nuance of NBA defense.At this age, the absurd production—14.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and 3.7 blocks per 75 possessions for his career—deserves far more credit than the shortcomings.90. Marc Gasol, Toronto RaptorsMarc Gasol has posted career-low averages in points (7.6), rebounds (6.3), blocks (0.9) and two-point percentage (44.0) this season, but his impact has been an overwhelming plus because of the way he has embraced his new role on the defending champion Toronto Raptors.Over half (53.8 percent, to be exact) of Gasol's attempts have been threes this season, a mark that is over 20 points higher than his previous career high of 31.4 percent from 2018-19. And he's converted 40.2 percent of those attempts.Having a 5 who forces the opposition's bigs to leave the paint does wonders for players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam, who still do plenty of damage as slashers.And though his raw block numbers are down, Gasol remains an effective deterrent inside. The Raptors have surrendered 6.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. What he's lost in athleticism, Gasol mostly makes up for with IQ. His rotations are always on point, and he's game for whatever scheme head coach Nick Nurse wants to deploy.His more focused three-and-D role has led to a plus-7.5 net rating swing that leads Toronto in 2019-20.   89. Clint Capela, Atlanta HawksIt's hard to blame the Houston Rockets for moving on from Clint Capela. Two non-shooters in that offensive system just wasn't sustainable, and the investment the team made to get Russell Westbrook meant he wasn't going anywhere.So, Clint Capela was dealt, and the Rockets went all-in on micro-ball.We haven't gotten a chance to see how Capela will fit on the Atlanta Hawks with Trae Young and John Collins, but there's reason to believe it will work.Capela is an elite roller and lob finisher who has still averaged 13.9 points, 13.8 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 32.8 minutes per game this season. And Young is already one of the game's best pick-and-roll passers. Capela should continue to get plenty of wide-open dunks set up by his point man.The only sticking point on offense is that Collins already does a lot of that. His expanding perimeter game could loosen things up, but there's some potential for crowding.Capela's real value to Atlanta may come on the defensive end. The Hawks are 28th in points allowed per 100 possessions this season, and every defense Capela has anchored has been above-average.  88. Andre Drummond Cleveland CavaliersNothing crystallized Andre Drummond's decline quite like the trade the Detroit Pistons brokered to unload him this season.They sent him to the Cleveland Cavaliers for John Henson and Brandon Knight (neither of whom were staples of Cleveland's rotation), as well as a second-round pick.\"They dumped him,\" The Action Network's Matt Moore wrote at the time. \"They straight up dumped Andre Drummond. They put Drummond out there like you did with your futon when you were moving out of your college apartment after graduation.\"The ability to avoid Drummond's next contract appears to be the motivating factor of the deal. He's shown better passing chops in recent years, but he's still way behind the curve in terms of the skills expected of bigs these days.Still, Drummond is one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history. And just last season, he posted a plus-11.4 net rating swing. If the passing is here to stay, he can still be helpful. But it will be interesting to see how teams gauge his value this offseason (assuming he opts out).  87. Hassan Whiteside, Portland Trail BlazersThe change of scenery has revitalized Hassan Whiteside. He has registered his best box plus/minus since 2015-16, as well as career highs in both offensive box plus/minus and true shooting percentage.His plus-10.5 net rating swing is, by far, the best he's ever posted. Now, some will quickly point out how many minutes Whiteside has spent with Damian Lillard, and that's fair. But Whiteside has helped the superstar point guard, too.In addition to his 16.3 points, 14.2 rebounds and league-leading 3.1 blocks in just 31.3 minutes per game, Portland has outscored opponents by 3.6 points per 100 possessions when Whiteside has been on the floor with Lillard. When Lillard has been on the floor without Whiteside, the Blazers have been outscored by 3.2 points per 100 possessions.  86. Lou Williams, Los Angeles ClippersHuman bucket Lou Williams will be torching twine long after he files for social security. The aesthetics of his offense are timeless: Give him room and watch him barbecue defenders with an endless array of fakes, wide crossovers, scoop layups, nonchalant-looking pull-up jumpers and floaters. Little about Williams changes from year to year, including this one. His game wants for a smidgen more efficiency, and he still gives zero Fs about playing defense, but his pick-and-roll and scoring artistry dazzle in perpetuity.Lowering his rank relative to the preseason is mostly a matter of splitting hairs. The margin of separation is so, so very thin outside the top 35.Williams' slight reduction in prominence accounts for the difference. As the talent around him has increased, his scoring output per 36 minutes and crunch-time usage have fallen from last year's watermarks. Los Angeles' offense is likewise less of a powerhouse when Williams runs the show without another primary option on the court—a stark departure from last year's performance.85. Jarrett Allen, Brooklyn NetsDeAndre Jordan's arrival never portended anything good for Jarrett Allen. Could he improve and endear himself to the long-term future of the Nets with a Kevin Durant- and Kyrie Irving-approved addition behind him?The answer is, predictably, complicated.Allen's minutes are down, and Jordan was immediately inserted into the starting five following head coach Kenny Atkinson's departure. This development is troubling for obvious reasons. Allen's strengths are Jordan's strengths—screen-setting, rim-running, paint protection—only he's younger and better in a few, if not all, of their shared areas of expertise. More troubling, though, is Allen's lack of development elsewhere. His three-point experiment is done, and he doesn't have any self-sustenance to his arsenal. After converting 44.9 percent of his hook shots last season, he's down to 40.9 percent now.Jordan doesn't have a broader reach, but he is the better passer. And whereas Allen can vanish on occasion, Jordan is more of an offensive constant.This doesn't make DJ the superior player overall. He doesn't crack our top 100 for a reason. Allen is the far more portable defender of the two. He may get outmuscled down low, but he has the side-to-side amble to neutralize threats in space. All of that said, Allen is clinging to top-100 status himself. That won't change unless he improves in the areas he has control over—specifically the depth of his offensive bag.   84. Robert Covington, Houston RocketsLast year's right knee injury may have stolen a morsel of Robert Covington's defensive inevitability, but that's it. He is still one of the league's most versatile and committed stoppers with an approach that exists in service of the entire team.Transitioning into a full-time power forward who moonlights at center (since arriving in Houston) has looked good on him. His rebounding is up to the task, and the Rockets are at their stingiest when he partners with P.J. Tucker on the frontline.Finite offense will always prevent Covington from being viewed in a more esteemed light. What few shots he takes inside the arc tend to come at the rim, an ideal profile for someone who works exclusively without the ball.But when your value is so soundly married to your floor-spacing, a below-average long-range clip—34.9 percent for the year; 35.7 percent in Houston—doesn't quite wow. And though Covington makes up some of that gap in transition, his offense is overdue for another postseason test before he can vault closer to top-50 territory.  83. Kelly Oubre Jr., Phoenix SunsThe 2019-20 campaign has marked a breakout for 24-year-old Kelly Oubre Jr. He's raised his scoring average in each of his five NBA seasons, peaking at 18.7 with the Phoenix Suns.His three-point percentage (35.2) is just shy of the league average on a steady diet of 5.5 attempts per game.And even with those marks on the offensive side of the floor, Oubre's greatest value may be derived from his defensive ability. His length and athleticism allow him to cover multiple positions. His tenacity leads to being second on the team in rebounds per game (6.4) and first in total rebounds.Overall, the Suns' defensive rating has been 2.8 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the floor, though the team still defends at a below-average level. When he shares the floor with another switchy wing in Mikal Bridges, though, Phoenix's defensive rating jumps to the 67th percentile.  82. Myles Turner, Indiana PacersIndiana underutilizes Myles Turner at the offensive end. He has the mobile handle to attack from face-up sets and is crafty enough in the post but is instead consigned to role-player duty. More than half of his shots are coming on spot-up jumpers, and his touches are way down from last season even though he's playing more minutes.That role simplification is equally necessary and unideal. Everyone has wanted Turner to up his three-point volume for the sake of easing the fit with Domantas Sabonis. He's done that; a career-high 44.3 percent of his attempts are coming from beyond the arc.But he's downing those looks, many of which are wide-open, at a 33.6 percent clip, and his timing without the ball needs work. Too many possessions end with him aimlessly occupying the same(ish) space as Sabonis.On the bright side, Turner's defensive captaincy is steadfast. He doesn't match up pound-for-pound with hulkier bigs, but he's a pesky helper and rim deterrent. And while his workload on the perimeter varies by opponent, he has the twitchy bendiness to make dynamic creators sweat on switches.  81. Al Horford, Philadelphia 76ersFor years, the notion that Al Horford was playing out of position as a center for the Atlanta Hawks just sort of floated around the ether of NBA fandom. When finally moved to power forward, it became abundantly clear that he is indeed a 5.The 76ers have been minus-2.4 points per 100 possessions with Horford at the 4 and plus-5.8 points per 100 possessions with him at the 5.This experiment may have made a bit more sense three or four years ago, but Horford's age (34) and the continuing evolution toward positionless basketball have simply made him too slow and interior-oriented to play power forward.Yes, Horford has shown an ability to hit threes, though he's at just 33.7 percent this season, but he still has a propensity to work inside. And it's fair to wonder if his career-high volume from three has contributed to the decline in efficiency.When he's been on the floor with Embiid and Ben Simmons, it's simply been too congested inside the three-point line.He has played nearly 1,000 minutes at the 5, though, and he's looked more like his old self there. In those alignments, he's averaged 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions.80. Tim Hardaway Jr, Dallas MavericksThe 2019-20 season may be the best of Tim Hardaway Jr.'s career. He's posting career highs in threes per possession, three-point percentage, true shooting percentage and win shares per 48 minutes.The Dallas Mavericks have been plus-12.7 points per 100 possessions (98th percentile) when Hardaway is on the floor with Luka Doncic and plus-5.0 when Luka is on the floor without Hardaway.Hardaway isn't the only reason for that difference, but an elite floor-spacer, which is exactly what his 40.7 three-point percentage says he is this season, is what Dallas should surround Luka with.All year, when Luka has kicked it out or around the perimeter, Hardaway has been keyed in and ready to cast off. He's fifth in total catch-and-shoot points and has a 63.7 effective field-goal percentage on those shots.     79. Evan Fournier, Orlando MagicFor a team that has a bottom-10 offense, Evan Fournier has been a life preserver. He and Nikola Vucevic are the only Orlando Magic players with above-average offensive box plus/minuses. He's second on the team in scoring (18.8) and first in threes per game (2.7).And Fournier isn't just a catch-and-shoot option, either. He's done plenty of damage off the dribble. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Khris Middleton, Kemba Walker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Chris Paul are the only players in the league who have matched or exceeded his field-goal attempts (352) and effective field-goal percentage (50.6) on pull-up attempts this season.  78. Draymond Green, Golden State WarriorsThe 2019-20 season has undoubtedly been a downturn for Draymond Green. His per-game averages of 8.0 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 0.8 blocks still present a picture of a versatile point forward, but his efficiency has been abysmal.He's shooting 46.5 percent from two-point range and 27.9 percent from three. His woeful 48.9 true shooting percentage is the worst mark he's posted since his rookie campaign in 2012-13.Turns out, it helps to have Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson around.Still, Green's all-around game has been a boon on a roster that has featured plenty of contributors who might have been in the G League under normal circumstances.When he's been on the floor, the Golden State Warriors' net rating has been 4.2 points per 100 possessions better. Their effective field-goal percentage has gone up two points, which is a credit to his playmaking because his shooting certainly hasn't provided that bump.And most impressive, the defense has actually been average and surrendered 5.8 fewer points per 100 possessions when Green has been on the floor.77. Joe Ingles, Utah JazzHe may be categorized as a small forward, but Joe Ingles has functionally been the point guard of the Utah Jazz's Quin Snyder era.That's tied largely to the fact that he's been with the team as long as Snyder, but during this partnership, Ingles' 1,695 assists almost double No. 2 on the list. His assist percentage over the same span trails only Ricky Rubio and Trey Burke among all Jazz players.He's gotten plenty of credit as a shooter over the course of his career, but Ingles' passing and feel for the game out of pick-and-rolls really drive his value.He's generally been a solid perimeter defender, as well. He doesn't possess the same vertical and lateral athleticism as other wings, but he has solid size (6'7\", 226 lbs), competes and is almost always in the right place on his rotations.Put it all together and it should be relatively easy to see why Ingles is having another high-impact season despite averaging just 9.8 points. On the season, the Jazz have been plus-5.9 points per 100 possessions with Ingles on the floor and minus-1.2 with him off.  76. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis GrizzliesYou're in no way alone if Jaren Jackson Jr.'s sophomore effort hasn't blown you away. His fouling and rebounding remain issues, and for all the positionless tools he sports, he doesn't yet look the part of someone who can lock horns with opposing centers. Memphis allows 113.4 points per 100 possessions (34th percentile) and struggles to keep offenses away from the rim with him at the 5.Still, the Grizzlies have far worse outcomes than a version of Jackson that can't sponge up heavy minutes at center. He has the lateral mobility to hang with contemporary 4s; this isn't the San Antonio Spurs trying to prolong LaMarcus Aldridge's time at power forward.It makes more sense to trumpet Jackson's offensive progress. His three-point-attempt rate has more than doubled from his rookie season while his efficiency spiked by nearly four percentage points. Only six other players who have logged at least 500 minutes are shooting as well from deep (39.7 percent) on eight-plus attempts per 36 minutes: Davis Bertans, Cameron Johnson, Danilo Gallinari, Paul George, Georges Niang and Karl-Anthony Towns.Jackson's range and volume are supreme luxuries on the frontline. Letting so many threes rip is a sure-fire way to ensure he has no trouble playing power forward, and it opens up the floor for his guards. Concern for his defensive progress is fine, but his long-range touch—which he couples with a fair-weather ability to put the ball on the floor, albeit in slow motion—gives way to a matchup-proof quality that cannot be undersold.75. Jonathan Isaac, Orlando MagicJonathan Isaac would've earned much higher placement if not for a left knee injury that might end his season. Thirty-two appearances isn't a lot, but it's enough to reinforce that he—not Aaron Gordon, nor Markelle Fulz, nor Mo Bamba—is Orlando's future.One-man defensive systems have that effect. Isaac is a hellfire draw for any big or wing. His length is ubiquitous in passing lanes, and he can simultaneously guard the big and ball-handler in pick-and-rolls.Getting off jumpers with him in the vicinity is a chore. He ranks in the top seven of both short and long mid-range shots despite missing more than half the season, according to PBP Stats. His length is equally imposing closer to the basket. Opponents are shooting 51.4 percent against him at the rim, a top-11 mark among 67 players challenging at least four point-blank looks per games.Future Defensive Player of the Year candidacy is absolutely in play, if not inevitable, for Isaac. The Magic need only be concerned about his offense. The odds of him developing a serviceable floor game are slim, and he doesn't yet have enough spacing around him to get more bites as the roll man. If he doesn't hone his three-point shot, then Isaac, like Orlando itself, will be up against an artificial ceiling.    74. PJ Tucker, Houston RocketsHas PJ Tucker ever missed a corner three? Asking for a friend.Tucker is the player every contender—and wannabe contender—lusts after: a low-usage shooter and defensive tryhard with positional range that contradicts his size. It isn't enough that he was already the Rockets' most valuable individual stopper on the wings. In the aftermath of Clint Capela's injury and eventual departure, they've made Tucker their de facto center.Living up to that job description isn't easy, period. It is an even more unreasonable ask for a 6'5\" 35-year-old who has made a career out of absorbing the toll attached to playing consistent, unyielding physical defense.And Tucker, for the record, is not some panacea in the middle. Houston's defense ranks in the 34th percentile of points allowed per 100 possessions when he's manning the middle. Sticking him next to Robert Covington has helped quite a bit, but there will always be a functional trade-off to playing sooo small, and it'll usually manifest most on the glass.Nevertheless, Tucker's value isn't exclusively tied to defensive returns. It is more so grounded in the freedom he provides the Rockets. They are the best version of themselves because he can switch from chasing wings to rumbling with bigs. Russell Westbrook, in particular, probably never completes his midseason turnaround without Houston diving into microball—an option the team only ever had because of Tucker.  73. Aaron Gordon, Orlando MagicAaron Gordon's offensive arc has unfolded like a career-long identity crisis. Is he a big? A wing? Can he shoot? Handle the ball?Definitive answers have yet to be provided—not flattering ones, anyway. Gordon's role has varied. And while he's still most likely best suited as a finisher out of the pick-and-roll and in transition, the Magic have steered him closer to the wing end of the spectrum. They have few alternatives and, thus, no choice.This isn't always the best look for anyone involved. Gordon isn't efficient on drives or when pulling up off the bounce. But he has started to find his way as a playmaker. Head coach Steve Clifford recently saddled him with more pick-and-roll initiation, and he's responded by averaging 5.0 assists—and 8.3 potential assists—over his past 25 games.The Magic won't soon trot out Gordon without another setup man. But his improving feel for facilitation diversifies an otherwise humdrum offense. And if his standstill three-point clip holds—39.3 percent over this 25-game stretch—Orlando will have one of the league's hotter commodities on its hands: a playmaking defensive difference-maker with usable outside touch.  72. Christian Wood, Detroit PistonsThe temptation to vault Christian Wood higher is real real. He epitomizes the in vogue center, someone who is a presence on the glass, swats the occasional shot, strokes triples and even puts the ball on the floor. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Serge Ibaka and Kristaps Porzingis are the only other players clearing 20 points, 10 rebounds, one block and one three-point make per 36 minutes.Sample size takes something away from Wood's year in review, but not much. It isn't his fault that Pistons head coach Dwane Casey stuck with Thon Maker for so long, or that he didn't enter the starting lineup until after the Andre Drummond trade. That Wood's per-game numbers since getting more burn have closely reflected his per-minute output is a big deal.Detroit will need to worry about its defense if he's the man in the middle, though. Wood, an Early Bird free agent after this year, can cover a lot of ground, but he's easily led astray off the ball, and opponents are unafraid to attack the basket when he's jumping center.Offensive variety is still enough to get him by even if he doesn't shore up his defense. He is at home squaring up for set triples, running into quick catch-and-launch looks, slipping to the baskets off screens, beating closeouts off the dribble and driving baseline. He has even flashed more advanced playmaking chops, increasing the frequency with which he finds shooters while on the move.  71. Patrick Beverley, Los Angeles ClippersPatrick Beverley continues to be the gold standard for superstar cohorts. Few players are as universally translatable. Even fewer are point guards.Would it be nice if Beverley could negotiate half-court defenses with an off-the-dribble jumper? Or protect the ball better out of the pick-and-roll? Or finish a little more consistently, and frequently, at the rim? Without question. But there is serious value in someone who has lasted at a ball-dominating position by doing just the opposite.Over half of his field-goal attempts come as spot-up threes, which he's converting at a nearly 40 percent clip. He can wreak a little havoc when attacking downhill but doesn't command a predetermined number of touches or shots. He plays offense without ego. It is quite the contrary at the other end.Beverley is a defensive workaholic, and he knows it. And he will let you know it, too. His reputation as a star-stopper neighbors on myth, but someone so emotionally invested in the outcome of every possession, whose motor will never be the least bit tied to his offensive usage, provides inestimable value.70. Dejounte Murray, San Antonio SpursDejounte Murray's return from a torn right ACL that cost him all of last season has not exactly unfurled according to plan. His strengths are as sturdy as ever. He is a terrifyingly talented rebounder for a guard and hasn't lost a step on defense. The nights he does get torched are evidence only of the difficult assignments he draws.Things aren't as rosy on the offensive end. Murray seems more comfortable putting up jumpers and is shooting well on long twos (47.0 percent) and threes (37.8 percent). But these looks come neither in volume nor haste. He needs time to get them off and still hasn't aggressively plumbed his off-the-dribble jumper.San Antonio's offense remains solvable when Murray is on the court. Defenses go under him, and he doesn't have the speed to make them pay off the bounce or the nerve to uncork enough jumpers. He complicates matters with spotty playmaking. He has a tough time capitalizing on pick-and-roll coverage and turns the ball over a ton in transition.To what end Murray's limited offensive growth falls on him is debatable. The Spurs' spacing is far from pristine, and DeMar DeRozan's usage caps the influence he has over the team, both as a scorer and table-setter—not to mention his exposure to Derrick White.For now, at least, San Antonio can count his return as a win. Murray's defensive nose remains intact, and better efficiency from the perimeter, even at minimal volume, isn't nothing.     69. Buddy Hield, Sacramento KingsPrior to this season, Stephen Curry (four times) and Steve Novak were the only players in league history with seasons in which they matched or exceeded Buddy Hield's 2019-20 marks for threes per 75 possessions (4.4) and three-point percentage (39.5).Even in today's three-happy game, that kind of volume and efficiency generally isn't found in the same player. Hield may be making a habit of it.On a roster as young as the Sacramento Kings', Hield has been a steady source of offense, particularly from behind the arc. The next step is getting to the line a bit more. But in the meantime, his shooting out of any situation makes him a dangerous weapon.This season, his effective field-goal percentage is 60.4 on catch-and-shoot attempts and 50.1 on pull-ups.  68. Dennis Schroder, Oklahoma City ThunderDennis Schroder is having perhaps the best season of his career in 2019-20. He's just a shade under his career-best box plus/minus, but he's easily cleared his career highs in effective field-goal percentage and threes per 75 possessions.He's also been a key component in one of the game's best lineups. When the Oklahoma City Thunder have fielded their three-guard attack of Schroder, Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, they have outscored opponents by an eye-popping 31.4 points per 100 possessions, a net rating that ranks in the 100th percentile.And we're not dealing with some minuscule sample here. That group has shared the floor for 850 possessions.They have managed to dominate opponents by exploiting a part of the floor many now ignore. CP3, Schroder and SGA are first, 12th and 24th, respectively, in two-pointers made from 10 feet and out. And all three are shooting at least 44.8 percent from that range (CP3 and SGA are both over 50 percent).Schroder's ability to beat his initial defender off the bounce and hit pull-ups before meeting the rim protector has done wonders for his efficiency, and his 6'8\" wingspan has allowed him to defend multiple positions in those guard-heavy lineups.  67. Jonas Valanciunas, Memphis GrizzliesJonas Valanciunas is navigating center's new world order just fine. The three-point shot he's tested over the past few seasons is a big part of it. He's hitting 36.7 percent of his triples on a career-high 1.7 attempts per 36 minutes, allowing Memphis to leverage him as both a roller and popper.Barreling his way toward the hoop remains one of Valanciunas' greatest strengths. His screens stop players dead in their tracks, and he's averaging a whopping 1.24 points per possession as the roll man (74th percentile).Defenders are still liable to look like puny humans when he goes to work down low. He is both hefty and handy: light on his feet, heavy with his shoulders. He's one of 10 players shooting better than 50 percent on at least three post-ups per game.Merging the traditional with the neoteric wouldn't mean much if Valanciunas couldn't hang on defense. He can. He's not matchup-proof, but his rotations around the basket are on point enough that he's a net-plus back-line stopper when playing beside rangier 4s. Memphis has maintained an above-average defense in the time he's spent next to Brandon Clarke or Jaren Jackson Jr.—nothing if not a ringing endorsement of Valanciunas' capacity to survive the ongoing frontcourt revolution.  66. Devonte' Graham, Charlotte HornetsDevonte' Graham is mission-critical to what the Hornets do. His off-the-dribble volume is the point of origin for everyone else's opportunities. Charlotte's offense opens up at all because defenses respect his pull-up jumper and the burst he shows going left.Efficiency is the cost of that import.Graham is shooting under 40 percent on twos overall and below 50 percent at the rim (11th percentile). His three-point clip has suffered after a strong start; he's at 33.3 percent from beyond the arc since the middle of December. It is clear, often painfully so, that he's being overstretched in his role. His is a game best deployed as a potent complement to an actual star. Charlotte has him running the whole damn show.Forgiving Graham's struggles is relatively easy under these circumstances. His shots serve a purpose. The Hornets' offensive rating improves by 11.3 points per 100 possessions, and their effective field-goal percentage jumps by 4.3 points with him on the floor—impressively huge swings that both rank in the top six among all players who have cleared at least 500 minutes.65. Derrick Rose, Detroit PistonsInjuries have once again put a damper on Derrick Rose's season—hip and ankle issues are the culprits this time—but not before he reestablished himself as one of the NBA's most potent offensive weapons.Only seven players are averaging more downhill attacks per game, a feat made all the more impressive knowing he sees substantially fewer minutes than all of them. He will never draw fouls like he did at the beginning of his career—his takeoff origins are too inconsistent and often angling away from contact—but he's shooting 64 percent around the rim (76th percentile).Most important of all, defenses are reacting to the results: 18.1 points and 5.6 assists per game.His three-point shot remains a wart, but his finishing at the basket and mid-range game command respect. The disorder he creates on the move is Detroit's shot-quality lifeline. Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook are the only players who have assisted on more corner threes, per PBP Stats, and the Pistons' offensive rating improves by 4.3 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (83rd percentile).      64. Bojan Bogdanovic, Utah JazzJoining the Utah Jazz has uncomplicated Bojan Bogdanovic's offensive utility. They have him run the occasional pick-and-roll and mix in an iso here and there, but he otherwise exists to open up the floor and alleviate the burden placed upon Donovan Mitchell.Well, mission accomplished.Bogdanovic is one of six non-bigs averaging more than 20 points per game with a true shooting percentage above 60. His company: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Khris Middleton.Last year's Indiana Pacers team leaned on Bogdanovic for from-scratch offense in the aftermath of Victor Oladipo's ruptured right quad. Though he tackled the task admirably, that was always an overextension of his skill set. He is more in his wheelhouse with the Jazz as a play-finisher.More than 20 percent of his offensive possessions come as spot-ups, on which he owns an effective field-goal percentage of 58.4—a top-10 mark among everyone who has gotten off at least 200 field-goal attempts in these situations. He's also shooting a rock-solid 45.4 percent on 9.1 drives per game.Occasional returns to self-creation separate Bogdanovic from other accessory scorers. He shouldn't really be the focal point of any lineup, but he can get to his desired spots coming around screens and is putting in 39.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers.Utah's playoff stock now needs Mike Conley to be Mike Conley more than ever. Bogdanovic underwent season-ending surgery to repair a right wrist injury, and without him, the Jazz are in the same predicament they found themselves in last year: absent a decided No. 2.  63. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ersEvaluating Tobias Harris' season against the five-year, $180 million max deal he signed over the offseason would be unfair to him. He isn't playing up to that contract, but the Sixers aren't paying him to. Last year's market gave him leverage. Philly's still-mysterious breakup with Jimmy Butler gave him more.Harris actually has performed up to snuff following a rocky start to the year. He's averaging 20.0 points and 3.1 points while swishing 39.1 percent of his threes since Nov. 15.For all the Sixers' offensive clumpiness, they've fared quite well when Harris sets up shop at power forward—lineup combinations they have at the same time fielded more than you think and not nearly enough. (Translation: What is Al Horford doing in Philly?) His defense has also been pleasantly solid, even relative to the less-squirmy assignments he pulls by seeing so much time between some combination of Josh Richardson, Ben Simmons and Matisse Thybulle.If Harris is guilty of anything, it's of not being Jimmy Butler. He doesn't foment the same defensive discord when working off the dribble and, by extension, cannot lug the burden of an entire half-court offense for long stretches or during crunch time. His job is made that much harder by the Sixers' wonky roster construction. That he's not higher is on his limitations as a three-level scorer, and on Philly for not putting him in a better spot.  62. Will Barton, Denver NuggetsKitchen-sink metrics are love, love, loving Will Barton's season. He grades out as a fringe top-50 player when looking at his average rank across six catch-alls. That clearly overestimates his impact, but it also isn't flat-out egregious.Lineup composition accounts for some of Barton's advanced-stat good fortune, particularly as it pertains to his defense.He keeps his fouls in check, and opponents have shot just 14-of-37 against him in isolation (38.0 percent), but Gary Harris usually spares him from covering the toughest wing assignment. And more than that, he's constantly on the floor with the rest of the Denver Nuggets' best players. As Jared Dubin wrote for FiveThirtyEight in December:\"Barton contributes at a considerably above-average level across a wide variety of categories on both offense and defense, and crucially, he’s doing so almost exclusively in the context of really good lineups. He’s been on the floor for 1,778 possessions this season, per PBPStats.com, and of those possessions, he has had at least three of Denver’s four other regular starters alongside him for 1,402 of them—a rate of 78.9 percent. That may not make Barton the eighth-'best' player in the NBA, but it does shed light on why a plus-minus statistic like RAPTOR thinks so highly of his contributions this season.\"The statistical dap Barton keeps receiving isn't all due to convenience. He's been huge for the Nuggets. After a right hip injury bilked much of his offensive mojo last season, he's back to capitalizing on life as the third wheel to Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray.Way more of Barton's looks are coming at the rim (35 percent) relative to 2018-19 (28 percent). His finishing around the basket isn't great (41st percentile), and he doesn't draw a ton of shooting fouls, but he's a reliable playmaker off the ball. His 1.22 points per spot-up possession rank in the 90th percentile, and he's converted 86.8 percent of his scoring opportunities off cuts (33-of-38). Denver can largely count on him to make the right pass when attacking closeouts.Doing a little in a lot of different areas adds up. Gordon Hayward, Brandon Ingram, Kevin Love, Khris Middleton and Karl-Anthony Towns are the only other players averaging over 15 points, three assists and six rebounds while knocking down at least 37 percent of their threes.  61. Ricky Rubio, Phoenix SunsRicky Rubio has lent a sense of two-way steadiness to the oft-wayward Suns. His inclination to push the ball keeps teammates hustling in transition, he's one of the league's best set passers, and Phoenix's rollers and cutters work that much harder knowing he'll find them. That he promises a measure of consistent backcourt defense is no less indispensable.Like always, though, Rubio's limitations come back to haunt him. His three-point clip is actually benefiting from a late-season boom, but he remains a non-threat to score off the dribble.Dubious range and passive shot volume make it difficult for him to headline lineups without another primary option. Plopping him beside a cast of players with finite floor games themselves during those minutes only exacerbates the issue. The Suns are finding out firsthand. They rank in the 2nd percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he plays without Devin Booker.60. Derrick Favors, New Orleans PelicansDerrick Favors is easy to miss among bigs with more bedecked offensive tricks. His three-point volume and efficiency never took off, and mid-range jumpers have been almost entirely weeded out of his arsenal over the past two seasons. Playing him can come at an opportunity cost if the offense doesn't have the spacing to milk his rolls to the basket or the flexibility to let him hunt second-chance points.New Orleans has done a nice job of establishing his fit, even when he plays with Zion Williamson at the 4. The team's guards ceaselessly push the ball in transition, and putting pressure on the rim is of the utmost importance. And it works.The Pelicans are fortunate it does. They can't afford not to play Favors. The same was true for the Utah Jazz. It would remain true if he were part of another team. His defensive presence is tone-setting. He is a back-line quarterback, and what he lacks in the fast-twitch department, he makes up for with court awareness.Targeting Favors on switches is seldom an effective ploy. He stays in front of ball-handlers, won't bite on head-fakes and has the lateral gait to remain attached at the hip when they do put their heads down. It is no accident New Orleans went from 26th in defensive efficiency through its first 25 games while Favors was dealing with injuries to eighth since. Other players face tougher assignments—mainly on the wings—but he is the backbone that keeps the half-court integrity intact.     59. Montrezl Harrell, Los Angeles ClippersRelentless is the word that best encapsulates Montrezl Harrell's court presence. He is neither an exceptional rebounder nor rim protector, but his game knows only one gear: light speed.Harrell will out-talent few of his opponents. He'll outwork almost all of them. His pick-and-roll synergy with Lou Williams is well-documented, but his finishing has more layers than that two-man connection. He will bruise his way to buckets in the post on one possession and then finagle his way to the basket, off the dribble, on the next.Someone who checks in at 6'7\" shouldn't be so apt at getting through and over bigger opponents. Harrell merges force with finesse in a way defenses can't quite contain. And the surety with which he carries himself—he isn't shy about finishing plays while logging time beside superstars and primary ball-handlers galore—has secured his transition from a per-minute superhero to a higher-volume, per-game weapon.To wit: Antetokounmpo and Jokic are the only other players averaging more than 18 points while shooting better than 59 percent on twos. Harrell's scoring opportunities are more elementary than theirs in the macro but no less overwhelming.  58. Brook Lopez, Milwaukee BucksBrook Lopez is so much more than his missed wide-open threes. And make no mistake: He's missing a bunch of wide-open threes. Among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 triples with a defender six or more feet away, his 29.2 percent clip ranks...124th.Volume and reputation help Lopez's floor-spacing value. He has made threes at a higher rate in the past and takes enough of them that defenses are drawn outside the paint. He mitigates his shaky shooting even further by peppering in some nifty drives. He has the handle to get around opposing bigs without an up-fake, and the in-between touch to put down looks on the move.Post-ups also remain a reliable part of his bag. He's averaging 1.08 points per possession in these situations (87th percentile). Functionally, then, he's still a threat from all over the floor.Lopez's defensive utility takes care of the rest. If he's not matchup-proof, he's pretty damn close. Where many of the switchiest bigs depend on side-to-side burst, he uses wide, low-to-the-ground stances.Smaller, quicker ball-handlers are hard-pressed to get around his length, and he is a case-specific virtuoso. The amount of space he leaves between face-up scorers varies by a player's strength—his speed, his outside touch, his willingness to pull up off the dribble, etc.When being challenged by Lopez at the rim, opponents are shooting 46.9 percent—a top-three mark among 67 players who defend at least four such looks per game. Rival offenses are getting to the basket less and taking more of their shots from mid-range with him on the floor, a direct result of his capability in space.Demanding he receive Defensive Player of the Year consideration goes a touch too far, but over the past two seasons, Lopez has indeed entrenched himself as one of the league's most impactful defenders.  57. Steven Adams, Oklahoma City ThunderSteven Adams doesn't get the usage of old-school bigs, but everything else about him screams throwback.He's resisted the three-point revolution. He's a banger on the boards. And he doesn't need credit for team success, even though the Oklahoma City Thunder's net rating is 2.7 points better when he's on the floor.His 10.9 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists, 1.1 blocks and 0.9 steals per game might sound modest, but that has at least a little to do with his playing time. Per 75 possessions, he has produced 14.8 points, 12.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.5 blocks and 1.2 steals. His 3.2 box plus/minus ranks 25th in the NBA, regardless of position.This is where advanced numbers come in handy. Adams, despite his lack of a jump shot and highlight-reel handles, has an impact on games as wide as his shoulders. He does a bit of everything. And his basketball IQ makes him an ideal gap-filler.\"I [don't] think people know how smart he is,\" former teammate Enes Kanter said of Adams, per Forbes' Nick Crain. \"I think he is one of the most influential, educated and smart people. He is probably the smartest basketball player I have ever played with or against.\"Adams always appears to be in the right place on the defensive end. He's a good roller in half-court sets, with a points-per-possession average that ranks in the 79th percentile on those plays, even without the top-of-the-backboard athleticism of players like Jarrett Allen or a prime DeAndre Jordan.He isn't likely to threaten for an All-Star selection, but Adams may be this position's quintessential glue guy.  56. Lonzo Ball, New Orleans PelicansPutting Lonzo Ball outside the top 50 feels wrong—not indefensible, but a little off. He turned a corner at the end of December and hasn't looked back. His averages across that 31-game stretch: 14.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.5 assists and 1.6 steals, which he's amassing while downing 41.0 percent of his threes.And yet, what Ball does for the Pelicans goes way beyond his numbers.He is their offensive intercessor, the playmaker most adept at negotiating everyone's fit next to one another. New Orleans needs someone who defaults to pass-first alongside so many ball-handlers and questionable shooters. Ball keeps the transition attack humming and everyone else's time of possession in proportion to the rest of the lineup.His significance is perhaps most telltale in the partnership he's forged with Zion Williamson. Forget that Ball has assisted on almost one-third of the rookie's baskets. The Pelicans seldom dare to play Zion without him. More than 73 percent of the possessions he's logged have come beside Ball, the ideal intermediary for anyone who, as of now, isn't in the business of creating his own shots beyond putbacks.55. Serge Ibaka, Toronto RaptorsThe evolution of Serge Ibaka probably tracks pretty close to that of the center position, generally. Over his first three seasons, he attempted just six threes. Over his first six seasons, he averaged 0.7 three-point attempts and a league-leading 2.6 blocks.In 2019-20, Ibaka is averaging a career-high 16.0 points and hitting 39.8 percent of 3.3 three-point attempts per game. For the first time in his career, he has produced less than a block per game.Ibaka is a completely different player than he was at the outset of his career. And his ability to space the floor from the 5 opens up the paint for slashing from players like Kyle Lowry and Pascal Siakam.When all three are on the floor, the Raptors outscore opponents by 8.8 points per 100 possessions and post a defensive rating that ranks in the 92nd percentile.Ibaka is a more offensively oriented player than he was early in his career, but that doesn't mean he can't still defend. In those aforementioned lineups, he and Siakam are both able to cover the inside or switch onto smaller players on the perimeter. Their combined length helps to make up for the lack of size from a backcourt that includes the 6'0\" Lowry and 6'1\" Fred VanVleet.      54. Marcus Smart, Boston CelticsFew players embody the argument for advanced stats better than Marcus Smart. For the fifth time in six NBA seasons, he's posting a below-average effective field-goal percentage. He's putting up a career high in scoring, but 13.5 isn't a number that leaps off the screen. Across the board, his basic numbers look relatively modest.But when you watch the Boston Celtics play, it's abundantly clear that Smart is one of those \"does all the little things\" guys. He can reliably guard four positions (sometimes five, depending on the opponent). He never takes a play off. He makes smart reads as a playmaker. And he doesn't demand a ton of touches on offense.That's all been true in 2019-20. Boston's net rating is 0.5 points per 100 possessions better with Smart on the floor.   53. DeMar DeRozan, San Antonio SpursDeMar DeRozan's net impact is under siege, even more so than it was last summer. His is a distressed value. He does everything deemed most important—initiating offense for both himself and others—but the terms of his engagement are so outmoded that they leave an imprint only under specific circumstances.The good remains really good. DeRozan is an intuitive scorer and passer out of the pick-and-roll. He can still manipulate defenses with his change of pace, and teams usually fawn over No. 1 options forever under control.Just seven other players are averaging more than 20 points and five assists while matching DeRozan's true shooting percentage, a list that mostly reads like a who's who of top-25 stars: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Devin Booker, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Nikola Jokic, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Not all efficient offense is created equal, though. DeRozan is getting to the rim more often and ranks inside the 99th percentile of shooting foul percentage, but he's still a blemish on his team's spacing. Almost two-thirds of his field-goal attempts come from mid-range, and the San Antonio Spurs don't even bother having him shoot threes.Star scorers deserve certain liberties. The mid-range isn't dead so much as readily available only to a select few, DeRozan among them. He creates enough of his own shots and, this season, hits enough of his in-between looks to let them fly.Building an entire offense around someone who plays this way is still tough. Like three-pointers, mid-range jumpers are high-variance, but with a lower payoff. Living on them is a fragile existence. It is even more tenuous when a team doesn't generate the spacing necessary to ensure those looks are of the best possible quality.DeRozan wrestled with the slimmest of margins until LaMarcus Aldridge started bombing more threes. And even since then, the Spurs have been 3.7 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor. (His defense is a problem.)Certain teams have the requisite shooting to optimize DeRozan. But to what end? Tailoring rosters around floor-raisers is always a nebulous venture, and as the gap between what DeRozan does best and what the league values most continues to widen, his ability to lift up a postseason contender will only wane.   52. Paul Millsap, Denver NuggetsPaul Millsap's role is nowhere near what it was during his All-Star campaigns with the Atlanta Hawks. He's 35 years old and playing 24.4 minutes per game (his lowest average since 2007-08). He is fifth among Denver Nuggets with 500-plus minutes in usage percentage.There's no question he's entered a role-player phase of his career, but he's undoubtedly making the most of the playing time he gets.On the season, Denver is plus-11.1 points per 100 possessions with Millsap on the floor and minus-1.4 with him off, giving him a 12.5-point net rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.He remains a Swiss Army knife of a defender who can bother multiple positions and rebound at a solid rate. And even alongside Nikola Jokic, he posts a solid assist rate for a big.Put everything together, and Millsap once again finds himself in a small club. Only five players match or exceed his marks for rebounding percentage, assist percentage, block percentage and steal percentage in 2019-20.Of course, those are rate stats, though. If anything is starting to go for Millsap, it's durability. He only played 38 games in his first season in Denver. And he has had a difficult time staying on the floor this season.\"The biggest mark against him is the missed time,\" Ryan Blackburn wrote for Denver Stiffs. \"The starting power forward only played 41 of a possible 65 games, missing 21 on the season and 16 in a row at one point. That’s difficult for any team to overcome, and in a shortened season, missing roughly one out of every three games makes life difficult on the rest of the team.\"The Nuggets have played like legitimate title contenders when Millsap has been on the floor this season. He is the perfect gap filler in lineups with stars like Jokic and Jamal Murray. They just need him to fill those gaps in a few more games.   51. Kevin Love, Cleveland CavaliersThe 2019-20 campaign has been something of a renaissance for Kevin Love. Last season, he appeared in just 22 games and posted his lowest box plus/minus since 2012-13.This season, he is averaging 17.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists and a career-high 2.6 threes in just 31.8 minutes per game. Adjust those numbers for pace and playing time and they jump up to 20.2 points, 11.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 3.0 threes per 75 possessions.And he has posted those numbers on a team generally dominated by guard play. Collin Sexton leads the team in usage, and Darius Garland and Kevin Porter are above 20 percent. Cleveland were 22nd in potential assists when the season was suspended.That led to viral moments of frustration like this one, wherein he threw his arms up at Sexton during a possession, demanded the ball, then two-hand chucked it Cedi Osman before stomping toward halfcourt.In January, though, Love expressed remorse over this and other moments from a difficult season.\"I wasn't acting like a 31-year-old, I was acting like a 13-year-old,\" Love told reporters. \"That was not me.\"He was the veteran presence the young Cavs needed from that practice on. Prior to that admission, he averaged 16.4 points. Afterward, he scored 19.0 per game.It remains to be seen whether that was enough to reinvigorate his trade value. Love's current deal takes him through 2022-23, which will be his age-34 season. He's set to make a whopping $91.5 million over those three years.That's a huge commitment, but a team that fancies itself \"one piece away\" may look at the last few weeks of Love's 2019-20 and think he's the floor-spacing, solid-passing big who'll put it over the top.After two decades of dominance, it's been a rough couple of years for the San Antonio Spurs. But as long as LaMarcus Aldridge is on the floor, they still score.Since the start of the 2018-19 campaign, San Antonio has put up 116.3 points and outscored opponents by 2.0 points per 100 possessions when Aldridge plays without DeMar DeRozan (the Spurs score 112.3 points per 100 possessions and are a minus-1.2 when both share the floor).When Aldridge is the focal point, the offense generally hums. And that especially became true after he fully embraced the three for the first time in his career.From Dec. 23 to the start of the hiatus, Aldridge averaged 4.2 three-point attempts per game and shot 41.6 percent from deep. Over the same stretch, the Spurs scored 115.4 points per 100 possessions with Aldridge on the floor and 111.3 with him off.Becoming a full-blown stretch 5 could add years to Aldridge's career. In the right situation, this newfound willingness to spread the floor could make things easier for the rest of a lineup.Defensively, Aldridge is posting a career-high 1.6 blocks per game, but the Spurs are terrible on that end when he plays, regardless of whether he's with DeRozan.On the season, San Antonio's 113.4 points allowed per 100 possessions rank 24th in the NBA. And that mark gets worse by 2.4 points when Aldridge plays.Still, if he were surrounded by better perimeter defenders, there's a world in which Aldridge is a very impactful modern 5.Being the No. 1 pick in a 2018 draft class that included Luka Doncic and Trae Young is a tough hand to be dealt. The chances that Deandre Ayton ever tops the hype surrounding either, especially Doncic, are slim. But if you just judge Ayton on his merits, he's off to a heck of a start.After a 25-game suspension, he averaged 19.0 points, 12.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in 33.2 minutes per game before the hiatus. On the season, the Suns are plus-0.7 points per 100 possessions with Ayton on the floor and minus-2.9 with him off.His 57.1 true shooting percentage eclipsed the league average, but not by much. That's likely the next frontier for Ayton. More trips to the line would help. A player with his size (6'11\", 250 lbs) and athleticism shouldn't be averse to contact.He could use some work on defense, as well, but the Suns' defensive rating is better when he plays. And the nearly two blocks per game is nothing to sneeze at. Ayton is already a sturdier anchor than many projected he'd be by his second year, but he doesn't strike fear into opposing slashers.Of course, for a sophomore, this is almost nitpicky. What Ayton's done with the start of his career is unusual. Tim Duncan, Blake Griffin, Shaquille O'Neal and Towns are the only players in league history to match or exceed his career averages for points (17.1) and rebounds (10.8) through an age-21 season.Malcolm Brogdon's first season with the Indiana Pacers began with a wave of exceeded expectations. The dribble penetration that shone so bright with the Milwaukee Bucks was in full bloom, only it looked much more impressive coming amid skimpier spacing and at higher volume. He was hitting threes, unloading a spruced-up off-the-dribble two and dropping dimes to teammates against defenses he himself scrambled.Some of these good vibes have persisted.He's hitting 50.3 percent of his pull-up twos for the season, and even as the speed at which he probes has gone down, his dribble drives continue to create opportunities for orbiting shooters and those hovering closer to the basket. But injuries have given way to inconsistency, and it can be tough to watch. As Indy Cornrows' Caitlin Cooper noted on the Hardwood Knocks podcast:\"His drives dropped quite a bit. His free-throw attempts bottomed out. His free-throw percentage dropped by a pretty big margin as well. And you noticed that he didn't really look like he was moving super well on either end of the floor. He's not a great point of attack to defender to begin with, but even when he was off the ball and had to help to the nail, he just looked stiff and brittle. Maybe this [quad] injury that he has, I don't know if that was something that was bothering him before, or what was going on.\"But obviously, his three-point shot hasn't necessarily carried over from Milwaukee either. He's down in the low 30s overall, and he's taking tougher threes—more pull-up threes and more contested threes as a product of no longer being a spot-up guy next to Giannis [Antetokounmpo] anymore. And [Victor] Oladipo isn't really there to generate that type of gravity.\"Writing off Brogdon's midseason spiral as the offshoot of injury woes is fair. Whiffing on contested, off-the-bounce three-pointers is one thing. Missing higher-quality looks is more problematic. Brogdon is finding nylon on just 31.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot triples and hitting only 28.8 percent of his wide-open long balls—the second-worst mark among 126 players who have attempted at least 100 uncontested threebies.Indiana needs him to knock down those looks to facilitate the fit with Oladipo. Brogdon's hot start, responsibility within the Pacers offense and raw numbers (16.3 points 7.1 assists per game) are enough to float top-50 placement for now, but he's primed for a decline if a cleaner bill of health doesn't render him more of a constant.Jamal Murray is at the same time an offensive standout and a source of concern for the Denver Nuggets.Twenty-three-year-old point guards can play with his level of bravado, but few in his age bracket can parlay that bluster into substance. That Murray can transition so effectively from playing off Nikola Jokic to breaking down defenses in the half court is a functional virtue, and he has already shown he can turn the tides of a playoff game.The importance of his off-the-dribble jumper increases tenfold versus the stingiest defenses and during crunch time in general.Handing him the offensive keys without Jokic is still touch-and-go. The Nuggets place in the 46th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when he runs solo—neither terrible nor average. This might say more about the lineups in which he plays during these stretches. Suboptimal spacing is a problem in many of the ancillary combinations.Denver needn't place too much stock in these Jokic-less returns...yet. Maintaining an average offense without one of the game's seven best offensive engines on the court is supposed to be a chore...for now. But these safety-net caveats won't last forever.After signing a five-year max extension last July, Murray is about to be paid like a star. The Nuggets don't have clear access to sustained title contention if he doesn't turn into a comparable sidekick for Jokic. Murray has his moments, but those displays aren't yet stasis. He too often disappears in the backdrop. At the very least, he hasn't made an appreciable leap.Check out his per-36 splits over the past three seasons:Right down to his shot distribution, Murray looks eerily similar to the player of the past three seasons. And while that's still good enough to scrap for a top-50 billing, a top-50 billing isn't good enough for what Denver's paying him to be.Spencer Dinwiddie's field-goal percentage, three-point percentage and free-throw percentage have seen fairly significant declines this season. Who knew that D'Angelo Russell was such a safety net?Still, the Brooklyn Nets muster just 102.5 points per 100 possessions when Dinwiddie is off the floor. For context's sake, the Golden State Warriors' league-worst offense scores 104.9 points per 100 possessions.When Dinwiddie is in the game, that number has jumped to 111.8, giving him an offensive rating swing that ranks in the 97th percentile.Despite the inefficiency on his own shots, Dinwiddie's presence on the floor makes things easier for everyone else. He has commanded plenty of defensive attention as the No. 1 option for all but the 20 games Kyrie Irving played and is a willing passer when that attention overwhelms. His career-high 6.8 assists lead the team.Stephen Curry and James Harden are the only players in NBA history with seasons in which they've matched or exceeded D'Angelo Russell's 2019-20 averages for assists (7.0) and threes (3.9) per 75 possessions.His ability to drag defenders well outside the three-point line opens things up for teammates with both the Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves. But it still feels like we've yet to see the fully realized Russell.Perhaps the pick-and-roll (or, more likely, pick-and-pop) game with he and Karl-Anthony Towns will do the trick. Sure, that same duo is a likely target for opponents on the other end of the floor, but it'll be a nightmare to cover.Russell has a sub-50 effective field-goal percentage on shots off the dribble this season, but defenses aren't able to load up on him when Towns is the one setting ball screens. And if the guard has his matchup on an island, he'll do plenty of damage.Zach LaVine's place relative to the rest of the league remains in flux. Someone who clears 25 points per game while nailing nearly 50 percent of his twos and 38 percent of his threes is clearly good, but the degree to which he can impact winning isn't yet known. Billing him as an empty-calories scorer is more than a touch too bold. LaVine's numbers are not solely the offshoot of unchecked volume. He has meaningful layers to his game.Anyone who can reliably find nylon on off-the-bounce threes is an asset, and LaVine has drilled 36.4 percent of his pull-up triples on top-15 volume. Junky twos aren't as prevalent in his offensive armory anymore, and he has appreciably increased his point-blank frequency over the past two seasons.Figuring out whether LaVine's production elevates those around him is where things get tricky. He is fine as a complementary playmaker but overstretched as anything more. And his off-the-bounce triples, while impressive, often seem less necessary and more the result of over-dribbling.This wouldn't matter if the Chicago Bulls were winning, or if LaVine guaranteed an average offense. They're not, and he doesn't.Chicago scores nearly four points more per 100 possessions with him on the court (80th percentile), but that jump is still only good for an offensive rating in the 28th percentile. LaVine isn't Devin Booker or Trae Young, two lifelines on losing teams who redefine their offense's ceiling. He's more of a floor-preserver—the kind of player who'd be a lot better off as the Bulls' No. 2.Gordon Hayward has finally settled into a new normal following the devastating compound left leg fracture and dislocated left ankle he suffered on opening night of the 2017-18 season. He is both better and more consistent than he was last year, his comfort level perhaps most evident in the ease and frequency with which he dribbles into turnarounds and fadeways that require him to spin or stop on a dime.At the same time, Hayward is visibly different.This is not the might-be All-NBA candidate the Boston Celtics signed in 2017. He has never put a ton of pressure on the rim, but he's at least slightly more reserved when attacking from advantageous positions in space. His presence at the foul line was on the modest end to begin with and has since been slashed. He's averaging a career-low 2.7 free throws per 36 minutes.Moving beyond what Hayward was versus what he is now isn't particularly hard. Boston has been unable to buy time on offense when he plays without Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker, and he's on the books for superstar money, but his shift in status post-injury isn't dire. He's still an effective, efficient player.Hayward is shooting a remarkable 55.3 percent inside the arc, including 53.6 percent on pull-up two-pointers. He ranks in the 91st percentile of efficiency on spot-up possessions, which account for nearly 20 percent of his offense. When he does get to the rim, he's converting at a 69.0 percent clip (89th percentile).The Celtics can't expect him to carry entire lineups, but they can count on his two-man game with Daniel Theis, tidy drop-offs to shooters and wicked-fast post entry passes.Viewed in its totality, Hayward's contribution falls well shy of stardom. His numbers—17.3 points and 4.1 assists per game with a 59.3 true shooting percentage—put him in esteemed company, but neither his responsibility nor volume is the same. It may never be.That's fine. Because if stardom is off the table, Hayward has already shown he can be the next best thing: high-end support for a championship contender.Fred VanVleet became a full-time starter this season, and he hasn't disappointed. Beyond the career-high 17.6 points he'saveraging, he shot 38.8 percent from three on 7.0 attempts per game. His 6.6 assists per contest have made him one of the game's top secondary creators as part of the Toronto Raptors' two-point-guard attack.But what really sets VanVleet apart from the point guards detailed above is his defense. Despite a listed height of just 6'0\", he manages to make life difficult for opposing 1s by seemingly setting up shop right under their dribble. It's almost like the undersized boxer is working way inside the range of his taller opponent.When he's on the floor, Toronto allows 105.9 points per 100 possessions, a mark that ranks in the 87th percentile. His in-your-face defense on opposing creators is a big reason why.Trae Young understandably gets the most attention of the young Atlanta Hawks, but it's his budding partnership with John Collins that has the potential to make him a winning player.When Young is on the floor with Collins this season, Atlanta is minus-1.7 points per 100 possessions. When he is on the floor without Collins, that number plummets to minus-7.3.A big who can score from the inside and the three-point line is borderline essential in today's NBA. And Collins is exactly that. Whether Young is quarterbacking a pick-and-roll or isolating, Collins is an ideal receiver.His points per possession as a roll man ranks in the 84th percentile this season. And he is shooting 42.5 percent on 3.3 catch-and-shoot three-point attempts per game.Collins is much more than the 21.6 points, 10.1 rebounds and highlight-reel dunks you've seen of him. He has the potential to be a thoroughly modern 5 and half of one of the league's best offensive duos.On the other end, Collins certainly isn't bad, but he's not the kind of dominant defender that can cover for the deficiencies of Young. Clint Capela may be that, and Collins is nimble enough to play the 4, but the ideal configuration may be Young, Collins and three switchy wing/forwards.However those lineups are aligned, Atlanta should feel confident that it already has the box checked for a big man with All-Star potential.Eric Bledsoe is one of the league's best among point guards. After making first-team All-Defense in 2019, there is no slippage from him in 2019-20.On the season, the Milwaukee Bucks allow an era-defying 95.3 points per 100 possessions when Bledsoe shares the floor with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Their overall defense, which ranks first in the league by a wide margin, allows 102.3 points per 100 possessions.Like VanVleet, Bledsoe is undersized (6'1\") but unafraid to play in close quarters. With his lateral quickness, he can play a more aggressive brand of defense than most.And his offense isn't too shabby, either. In fact, after a few years alongside the MVP-caliber Giannis, Bledsoe might be a bit underrated on that end. This season, he's averaging 25.4 points and 7.4 assists per 75 possessions with a 58.3 true shooting percentage when Giannis is off the floor.It took him some time to find his basketball legs again, but once he did, Kristaps Porzingis has looked like the ideal big-man complement to Luka Doncic.He had averages of 19.2 points, a career-high 9.5 rebounds and a career-high 2.5 threes when the season was put on hiatus, but his 54.0 true shooting percentage was over two points below the league average.From Jan. 31 up to the suspension, though, he was at 25.2 points, 10.9 rebounds and 3.2 threes with a 60.5 true shooting percentage.After sitting out all of 2018-19 while recovering from a torn ACL, we probably should've expected the slow start, but even when the shots aren't falling, you can see the stylistic fit.\"He's throwing some really cool lob passes to [Dwight] Powell,\" coach Rick Carlisle told reporters in December. \"I mean, you've got a 7'3\" guy throwing to a 6'10\" guy on a lob? That's pretty [expletive] cool if you ask me. Let's get off of all this stuff that KP needs to go in the post. He doesn't. He doesn't. I'm OK with him going in there once in a while, but we don't post anybody.\"Porzingis as a key cog in Dallas' Luka-run offense has worked wonders. The 116.7 points per 100 possessions the Mavericks have scored is an all-time high.But the bigger impact from KP may come on defense. His offensive rating swing is a near-neutral plus-0.1. But opponents score 5.0 fewer points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor. He has a top-10 block percentage this season and leads all Mavs with at least 500 minutes in defensive rebounding rate.If he maintains that sort of defensive impact next season, while playing like he did in the first few months of 2020 on offense, the Mavericks will have one of the game's top duos (if they don't already).Danilo Gallinari is still better than people realize. He is in his third season of posting a 60-plus true shooting percentage, a 35-plus free-throw-attempt rate and a 40-plus three-point-attempt rate, and he's top 70 all time in career offensive box plus/minus. James Harden and Chauncey Billups are the only players with more such seasons.This distinctly modern game has been a staple for Gallinari for years, but it has been particularly effective alongside Chris Paul with the Oklahoma City Thunder. When the two vets share the floor, OKC score at a blistering rate of 120.1 points per 100 possessions (99th percentile).And while CP3 rightfully gets most of the praise for the Thunder's better-than-expected attack—even Gallo said, \"I think he's the best leader that I've played with.\"—the Italian forward deserves plenty of credit.Paul spreads the ball around more than most floor generals, but Gallinari is still his top assist target. And when CP3 plays without Gallo, that offense plummets to a below-average 109.3 points per 100 possessions.That impact has a lot to do with the shooting that forced defenders to watch him outside, but Gallinari brings a lot more offense to the table. His pump-fake-and-go game is top-tier. And he's one of the game's best at identifying disadvantaged defenses and actually moving into a drive before the catch. He's not the most explosive athlete, so even those plays didn't often end with wide-open layups, but he draws plenty of fouls that way. His uber-efficient attack is a critical part of the Thunder's success.On the other end of the floor, he has a harder time overcoming his weaknesses. He's often caught flat-footed on the perimeter. And he doesn't rebound a ton, despite being 6'10\". Both contributed to opponents scoring 8.0 more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor, a defensive rating swing that ranks in the fifth percentile.But even with that deep of a hole dug defensively, Gallinari's plus-6.6 net rating swing still ranks in the 85th percentile. That's how much of an impact his offense makes.Giannis Antetokounmpo is the only player who matches or exceeds Nikola Vucevic's averages for points (20.3), rebounds (11.6) and assists (3.8) over the last two seasons.Yes, that Antetokounmpo. The reigning MVP with a good shot to join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season.Of course, Antetokounmpo blows away the thresholds set by Vucevic, but the production is plenty impressive nonetheless.Like others on this list, Vucevic has improved his standing in the league by embracing the three-point shot and facilitating from the post. For the first six years of his career, he averaged 2.0 assists and 0.3 three-point attempts per game. Over the last three, those numbers are up to 3.7 and 3.6.And his more evolved game has made him, by far, the most important player on the Orlando Magic.Since the start of the 2017-18 campaign, Orlando is plus-1.3 points per 100 possessions with Vucevic on the floor and minus-5.3 with him off. The offensive rating takes a 6.2-point tumble when he sits.When he's on the floor, Vooch commands defensive attention whether in the post or surveying the floor from up top. This, of course, makes things easier for teammates who've struggled to carry offensive responsibility throughout their careers.On the other end of the floor, Vucevic isn't likely to threaten for Defensive Player of the Year anytime soon, but he's done a solid job of piling up counting stats as a member of the Magic. There are only seven players who match or exceed his totals for blocks and steals since he went to Orlando in 2012. And he's had an above-average defensive-rating swing in three of his last four seasons.One of the key differences between Bledsoe and De'Aaron Fox is that the former has the luxury of playing over two-thirds of his total minutes alongside an MVP. His burden is significantly lighter than Fox's, a third-year guard tasked with engineering the offense of a team without an All-Star.Even with the heavy load and an early-season injury that cost him 17 straight games, though, Fox has maintained his career's upward trajectory. He's averaging 20.4 points and 6.8 assists in just 31.7 minutes per game, and he's scored at an above-average rate in isolation and as a pick-and-roll ball-handler.As (or if) Sacramento fills out the roster around Fox with more reliable offensive players, and defenses can afford less focus on the point guard, Fox's ability to attack one-on-one will yield even better overall numbers.Domantas Sabonis' first All-Star campaign has been a doozy.And his basic averages of 18.5 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 0.8 steals might not even do his production justice.Let's take a look at a pace- and playing time-adjusted comparison to 2013-14 Kevin Love, who finished second in the league in box plus/minus:The key differences, of course, were Love's scoring and the fact that he was hitting threes, but the statistical similarities are unavoidable.The Indiana Pacers have a superstar talent on their team who can score around the rim and from the mid-range. His passing unlocks opportunities for teammates like T.J. Warren, Malcolm Brogdon and Victor Oladipo.And he's almost certainly better defensively than the 25-year-old Love.The Pacers allow 4.8 fewer points per 100 possessions with Sabonis on the floor this season. And that isn't exclusively a function of the time spent with Myles Turner (though it helps). Indiana still defends at an above-average level when Sabonis plays without Turner.He's not a lockdown defender on the perimeter or a lights-out rim protector, but he generally does a decent job of just being in the way. Sometimes, that's enough from a big man. That and his ability to dominate the defensive glass makes Sabonis a plus on that end.Treating Ja Morant as a top-10 point guard and top-30ish player overall is not a rush to coronation. He's earned it.Rookies seldom ferry his workload while sustaining above-average efficiency. Walter Davis, Tim Duncan, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal and David Robinson are the only other first-year players who have matched his usage (26) and true shooting percentage (56.8).Morant's game is essentially the marriage of flash and substance. His off-the-dribble escapism bends defenses and renders traditional bigs forced to switch or rotate on to him a special kind of helpless. Every dunk attempt is an event—even the missed ones. And though his takeoffs may, on some level, be for the 'gram, they change the way teams must guard him inside the free-throw line.Tremendous downhill touch only complicates the pickle in which Morant puts defenses. He complements his explosion with split-second finesse. Could-be rim assaults are also potential scoop shots. He's hitting 51.3 percent of his floaters.That Morant partners this touch with on-a-whim vision is unfair. He's more of an equal opportunity scorer and facilitator than a points-first engine. His improvisation on the move belies his experience. He might possibly lead the league in assists thrown after leaving his feet.Knowing that Morant has room to improve is scary. Fewer of his passes will go haywire as he gains more reps, and his occasional off-the-dribble three could turn into a moderate- or high-volume staple.Left alone, though, Morant already holds his own against the NBA's best offensive players, and his first season is almost beyond comparison to others. Oscar Robertson and Trae Young are the only other rookies to clear 20 points and eight assists per 36 minutes.CJ McCollum leaves a lot to be desired when viewing his game through the lens of conventional stardom.He doesn't get to the rim or foul line at a high clip and is a coin-toss finisher when he does attack the basket. He has great chemistry with bigs out of the pick-and-roll, can spot shooters while going downhill and boasts great ball control but is overtaxed as the primary setup man.The Portland Trail Blazers offense when he plays without Damian Lillard has only ranked higher than the 38th percentile once over the past five seasons (2015-16).By those measures, McCollum could be overrated, now more so than ever after he signed a three-year, $100 million extension over the summer. But his standing is only compromised insofar as you're still expecting him to be someone else.Portland isn't paying him to be a situational No. 1. He is meant to be the team's No. 2 through and through, a certified buckets-getter who can moonlight as a playmaker but earns his keep by providing cornerstone offense as Lillard's second in command.McCollum has seldom failed to hold up his end of this bargain. He is one of the smoothest scorers alive. It'd be nice if he could swish more off-the-dribble threes, but he doesn't need to lean on outside volume when he wields an automatic in-between game. He is shooting 47 percent from mid-range overall (89th percentile) and keeps defenses guessing with a mix of deadly accurate floaters (45.7 percent) and stop-and-pop twos (50.0 percent).What separates McCollum from, say, Zach LaVine isn't just a matter of opportunity. He's in the ideal role for his skill set, but he's also shown everything he does translates to the playoff pressure cooker. He can still get to his spots in cramped spaces and doesn't receive nearly enough credit for his tough-shot making.That he also collects his 20-plus points per game without significantly eating into the usage of those around him—he's downing 47.1 percent of his catch-and-fire threes—is very on-brand. He's made a career out of effectively straddling the line between star and complement.Struggling through consecutive postseasons did little to slow Donovan Mitchell's hype train. Anyone would be overburdened as his team's sole from-scratch scorer. Every star must have a viable No. 2. The Utah Jazz needed to get Mitchell his.And then they did. Sort of.The Mike Conley acquisition hasn't panned out, but Bojan Bogdanovic and Jordan Clarkson adequately stock Utah's roster with shot-makers, even if they're not letter-of-the-law sidekicks. The offense should be more equipped to handle the postseason crucible because of them, albeit less so following Bogdanovic's season-ending wrist injury. The idea of Conley can still be an asset, too.But Mitchell's numbers aren't yet reflective of the Jazz's sturdier offensive depth. Though his scoring is almost identical to last season's (25.4 points per 36 minutes) and coming on better efficiency, his true shooting percentage (56.0) remains below the league average (56.4). Long twos are, somehow, an even bigger part of his game, and they're coming at the expense of his volume around the rim.Taking fewer shots at the basket has cut into Mitchell's foul-line trips, and he wasn't an especially frequent customer at the charity stripe in the first place. Among the 40 players with a usage rate of 25 or higher, his free-throw-attempt rate ranks 33rd.Keeping his three-point clip above 36 percent is a win, but only a minor one. He's still not knocking down deep balls off the dribble; he's converting just 31.6 percent of his pull-up triples.Age and role ensure Mitchell will remain the Jazz's most important building block. That's different from their most valuable player. Rudy Gobert still holds that honor, and Mitchell hasn't made enough of a jump to suggest that's about to change.Utah is getting slaughtered whenever he plays without the Stifle Tower while posting a crummy offensive rating. This doesn't mean Mitchell is bad. He's not. It does mean he has a long way to go before the Jazz can comfortably declare him the face of the future.All the tricks Shai Gilgeous-Alexander flashed as a rookie have proved to be but a prelude. He is no longer a young prospect ahead of schedule. He's one of the NBA's most underrated scorers.Gilgeous-Alexander has made great use of the extra license the Oklahoma City Thunder have bestowed upon him. His three-point clip is down, but he's stayed above 35 percent while creating more of his own opportunities. Under 10 percent of his made treys came without assists last year. That number has soared up to over 43 percent this season.Exchanging looks at the rim for longer twos is often frowned upon, but the in-between game suits Gilgeous-Alexander. He's knocking down 45.0 percent of his mid-range jumpers (83rd percentile) and splashing in 45.9 percent of his floaters.Endorsing his shot distribution is even easier when it comes with a rising free-throw-attempt rate. He has added more changes in pace and in-and-out dribbles to his repository and is much better at finishing through contact from outside the restricted area.Others will be lower on Gilgeous-Alexander until he brings more oomph as a playmaker. His opportunity is finite beside both Chris Paul and Dennis Schroder, but he continues to look more like a hybrid wing than a combo guard. Oklahoma City's offense has sputtered whenever he plays without Paul, and he's tallied just 109 possessions as the official point guard.As is, though, Gilgeous-Alexander can be the second-best offensive player on a ridiculously good team. And he doesn't necessarily need to approximate floor-general value when he's so darn useful at the other end. He can make life hell on both guard spots and even wing-sized whatevers. The Thunder haven't shied from using him on Ben Simmons- and Brandon Ingram-types.His All-Star peak isn't just in play. It feels inevitable.Somewhat lost amid Jayson Tatum's climb into superstar territory is the humdinger of a season Jaylen Brown has pieced together. He's averaging a career-high 20.4 points per game while downing 38.1 percent of his threes and a gaga 55.2 percent of his twos. After three years of hovering in the mid-60s, his free-throw conversion rate sits at 73.6 percent—on a personal-best 4.6 attempts per 36 minutes, no less.Brown's progress is palpable enough that he generated some All-Star buzz. His failure to make the cut shouldn't be spun into anything too profound, but it does nod to a certain lagging. He's still stereotyped into more of a specialist's box rather than formal stardom.Whether that's unfair is in the eye of the beholder. The Boston Celtics don't yet know if they can win a title with Brown as their third-best player, and he'll always pale in comparison to most of his would-be peers on the offensive end. His is a role rooted more in finishing plays than creating them.Over half of his possessions come as transition or spot-up opportunities, and close to 90 percent of his made threes are assisted. His volume as the pick-and-roll ball-handler has more than doubled from last season, but he doesn't pass enough for the offense to actually run through him, and his handle can get unglued when he's tasked with doing more than attacking decongested lanes.Without a semi-sizable shift in focus, this caps Brown's apex much like it does for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander—in that it's marginally prohibitive but mostly doesn't matter because of the heavy lifting he does at the other end.Boston's three-wing lineups wouldn't be so effective without Brown's defensive bandwidth. He rumbles with power forwards more than Tatum or Gordon Hayward, and only Marcus Smart sees more reps against No. 1 options, according to data from Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu. Brown's presence on the glass is likewise paramount to the Celtics using the good-but-undersized Daniel Theis so freely at the 5.Elite three-and-D specialists have fringe-star value. Brown is more than that. He has a broader offensive responsibility than catch-and-shoot connoisseurs, and his combination of volume and efficiency verges on anomalous. Giannis Antetokounmpo, DeMar DeRozan, Khris Middleton and Brandon Ingram are the only wings who match his scoring, usage and true shooting percentage.If you're thinking this placement is over-ambitious for a 19-year-old rookie who has only played 565 minutes, you're not alone. Even the writers behind this project struggled with the idea of Zion Williamson already being a top-four power forward.But his numbers leap off the screen about as explosively as the player himself leaves the hardwood.The New Orleans Pelicans' net points per 100 possessions is 12.2 points better with Zion on the floor, a swing that ranks in the 97th percentile and adds an estimated 29 wins to the team's expectancy over an 82-game slate.His 27.5 points per 75 possessions is the second-highest mark for a rookie since 1973-74 (as far back as per-possession data goes), just behind Joel Embiid in 2016-17 and just ahead of 1984-85 Michael Jordan.Zion's 62.4 true shooting percentage ranks first among rookies who logged a 25-plus usage percentage over the same span. Arvydas Sabonis (who was 31 during his rookie season) and David Robinson (24) wind up the top three.As far as scoring and impact go, Williamson pretty clearly justifies his position on this list. His feel in both fast breaks and halfcourt sets is way beyond his years. He knows exactly when to cut and sees lanes opening up seemingly ahead of time. His second jump is absurd, maybe even on par with a prime Shawn Marion, whose playing weight was 60-plus pounds lighter.Offensively, the next steps for Zion are probably a more consistent jump shot and a bit more playmaking for others. But even without those things, he's already a devastating offensive weapon.He needs a lot more work on the other end. His focus there seems to come and go far too often. His block and steal rates from college haven't yet translated. And it feels like he should be gobbling up more defensive rebounds. But we have to remember that he's a rookie. And he's a 19-year-old rookie. The learning curve for NBA defenders is steep.What's clear is that he has the physical tools to dominate defensively. His basketball IQ on offense suggests he should be able to pick up the concepts necessary to be a plus on both sides of the ball. But even if he doesn't live up to his potential as a defender and becomes, say, average on that end, his offense would still make him a mainstay at the top of lists like this.Brandon Ingram has come of role this season. Beforehand, he was the silhouette of an offensive hub, but only for stretches at a time, usually toward the end of the schedule. This year, on a new team that has given him more creative agency, he's been a wire-to-wire force.His All-Star selection speaks for itself, even though it came during a down year for Western Conference wings. His numbers say even more: 24.3 points and 4.3 assists per game with a true shooting percentage of 59.0—benchmarks that, prior to this year, have only ever been hit by one player in his age-22-or-younger season. That player's name? Michael Jordan.Friendlier circumstances (and a cleaner health bill) aren't solely responsible for Ingram's ascent. He has both broadened and refined his game.He's always had a knack for reaching his spots on-ball and making plays at the rim, but his finishing lagged elsewhere. He now wields a more consistent touch between 10 and 16 feet and a more willing trigger finger from beyond the arc. Both his three-point and free-throw clips have exploded relative to his career average.What's most impressive about Ingram's arrival isn't the leap itself but its endurance. His improvement has not only spanned the entire season, but it's also survived two different iterations of the New Orleans Pelicans: pre-Zion Williamson and post-Zion Williamson.Slightly lower usage beside Zion has not rattled Ingram. He's been money in catch-and-shoot situations (60.2 effective field-goal percentage), and his true shooting percentage has dropped without plummeting when they share the floor. Encouraging still, across a 704-possession sample, New Orleans owns a plus-14.6 net rating with Ingram and Zion manning the 3 and 4, respectively.This is not a small development. Ingram's success as part of a larger operation, one that doesn't always default to him, was never a given. Deference can throw players off balance.Ingram himself still has kinks to work out next to Zion, but the early returns suggest his leap is at once permanent and, just as important, generally adaptable.Any lingering urges to loop Devin Booker into the empty-stats brigade need to be stamped out. That stance was always hyperbolic. Youth needs time to marinate, and the Phoenix Suns never put enough NBA talent around him to infer a correlation between him and their downtrodden record.They still haven't. The Suns are much better off than they were in 2018-19 when Booker wanted for the most fundamental ball-handling support. But the core he headlines now still isn't perfectly designed to simplify his role or guarantee palatable proximity to the Western Conference playoff picture.Adding Ricky Rubio is a start. Booker is no longer Phoenix's only primary playmaker. But he remains its most influential one. The Suns rank in the 79th percentile of points scored per 100 possessions when Booker is on the floor. That efficiency bottoms out to the 2nd percentile in the minutes Rubio plays without him. (Phoenix's offense is in the 33rd percentile when Booker runs the show on his own.)What little relief Booker has received—mainly from Rubio, career-year Kelly Oubre Jr. and Deandre Ayton—looks awfully good on him. His efficiency has been on the come-up for most of his career, and he's reached yet another new height this season.Among the 58 non-bigs who have played at least 1,000 minutes and are averaging at least 15 points, Booker's true shooting percentage ranks fourth, behind Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton and Davis Bertans. He's on pace to become the 10th player to clear 25 points and five assists per game with a true shooting percentage higher than 61, joining James Harden (six times), LeBron James (six times), Michael Jordan (four times), Stephen Curry (three times), Kevin Durant (three times), Larry Bird (twice), Giannis Antetokounmpo (twice), Isaiah Thomas and Lillard.Between his continuously improving feel for jump-starting an offense, multilevel scoring and the ability to leverage touch and cutting without the ball, Booker is now, without question, one of the league's most impactful players.Bam Adebayo may embody the future of the center position more than anyone on this list. He has the size (6'9\", 255 pounds) to play the 5, but he can be trusted to switch onto any position, handle the ball, facilitate, finish inside and even do a little damage in the floater zone.On the season, he's averaging a well-rounded 16.2 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.2 steals per game. The only thing left is three-point range. And that may be on the way. According to ESPN's Zach Lowe, he went 31-of-50 on corner threes in a predraft workout for the Miami Heat.In an increasingly positionless NBA, guys who can do everything will reign.Michael Pina wrote for SB Nation:\"When [the Heat] look at Adebayo they don't see a position, and even before they took him 14th overall in the 2017 draft they didn't see a prospect who should be boxed into a role. Adebayo is an original, one-of-one — a jittery ball of unselfish, peerlessly athletic energy whose lone hobby is discovering new ways to dismantle traditional norms on a basketball court.\"On the season, 16 players have taken at least 10 shots when defended by Adebayo. They vary from point guards like Markelle Fultz, Russell Westbrook and Spencer Dinwiddie, to wings like Bradley Beal, to bigs like Joel Embiid and Nikola Vucevic. Only two of those 16 shot at least 50 percent against Bam. And Giannis Antetokounmpo, the reigning MVP, was 8-of-23 (34.8 percent).The tenacity and versatility of Adebayo makes him an ideal defensive anchor for the Heat, alongside Jimmy Butler. But his potential on the offensive end may be every bit as tantalizing.Adebayo isn't just making run-of-the-mill kick-outs from the post for his assists. He's passing on the move, out of rolls, from the top of the key or the elbow. He's comfortable passing with either hand. And his vision may be better than any big man's, save Jokic's.The next evolution for this position is \"point center.\" Jokic has been doing that for a while with the Nuggets. Adebayo brings significantly more athleticism to the equation.Jrue Holiday is the same as ever: damn good and underappreciated.Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson have all taken turns overshadowing him on offense, which is to be expected. They're new and shiny, and Holiday has almost always blurred the line between primary option and complement. But his role hasn't actually changed all that much alongside the New Orleans Pelicans' most prominent additions.Sure, his usage is slightly down. And yes, he's taking the occasional extra standstill jumper. For the most part, though, he remains New Orleans' offensive engine.No one on the team runs more pick-and-rolls per game, and rather than ween off his self-creation, he's steered further into it. He looks more comfortable dancing with the ball in his hands and is churning through an almost identical number of pull-up jumpers compared to last season. More of his made threes are actually going unassisted (44.3 percent, up from 40.7), and he continues to bust out his step-back jumper.Plenty of scorers shoot higher clips, but Holiday is efficient enough relative to his role. He's hitting more than 50.0 percent of his two-pointers and within striking distance of league-average accuracy from distance (35.7 percent) while putting up nearly 20 points and seven assists per game.Demands to drop Holiday further likely don't properly value his defense. The idea that he's not as much of a neutralizer is, frankly, a little absurd—like his job description.Just look at the six players he's spent the most time guarding: Luka Doncic, LeBron James, CJ McCollum, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Damian Lillard and Devin Booker. I mean, my goodness. Difficult assignments don't equate to good defense, but Holiday is the exhaustive ball hawk the Pelicans stick on the very best without sending him much help.Finding another player who bears his burden at both ends is almost impossible. Two-way primary usage, a metric developed by Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu, measures the amount of time a player spends as the No. 1 option on offense while guarding the other team's No. 1 scorer. Ben Simmons is the only player in the league with a higher two-way workload than Holiday.Sharing the offensive workload with fellow star teammates and a quality supporting cast looks good on Kemba Walker. It would look even better if left knee problems didn't cost him a chunk of the season.Sticking him this low could come off as an insult. It isn't. It is more so a nod to the league's depth of star power—especially at point guard. Eight floor generals are in front of him, and with the exception of the top two or three, Walker has an argument to be ahead of everyone else. Welcome to the world of splitting hairs.On the surface, Walker is not a material upgrade over Kyrie Irving for the Boston Celtics. He is scoring at a lower and less efficient clip, and their average touch time is about the same. Walker is actually controlling the ball for longer per possessions than 2018-19 Irving.The bigger, more important difference lies in Walker's usage. He is a better complement than Irving to the rest of Boston's roster, a comfier fit who has paved the way for Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward to do more.Fewer of Walker's buckets are coming off assists (36 percent) compared to his predecessor (37.3 percent), but he works in isolation much less. Both may be similar in how long they hold onto the ball, but Walker burns through fewer touches overall. And it is Walker who gives more consistent damns on defense.Mind you, ceding touches to his supporting cast and status to Tatum has not dulled Walker's star quality. He is the Celtics' best pick-and-roll initiator, leading the team in crunch-time usage rate and draining 36.4 percent of his pull-up three-pointers, which he launches more often than everyone in the league except for Luka Doncic, James Harden, Damian Lillard and Trae Young.Tatum's ascent has rendered him Boston's most valuable player, but Walker still has claim to the team's offensive crown. The Celtics are scoring a team-high 7.6 points more per 100 possessions with him on the court, during which time their perimeter-shooting efficiency skyrockets.This steadying star power is nothing new. Spending his entire career in Charlotte may have limited his national exposure, but Walker has been this same bracing force for some time. Five-year regularized-adjusted plus-minus ranks him as the sixth-most valuable offensive player since 2015, according to NBA Shot Charts. His role may have shifted in Boston, but he's still clearly among the NBA's very best.Trae Young's detractors needn't reach deep into the bag to find their rebuke: If he's this good, if he's already a top-25 player, why aren't the Atlanta Hawks better? It's a fair question. And Young's defense alone might provide the answer.Catch-all metrics portray him as a certifiable nonfactor at the less glamorous end. He is dead-last in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus and NBA Shot Charts' luck-adjusted defensive regularized adjusted plus-minus. And he ranks third-to-last, ahead of just Bradley Beal and Darius Garland, in NBA Math's defensive points saved.Non-defenders can be tricky cornerstones. They complicate attempts to build contenders. The breadth of Young's offense does not excuse his transgressions at the other end. But it comes pretty damn close.Young's ultra-deep pull-up threes warp entire defenses. Planning for someone who's willing to fire away just inside the timeline is a migraine-and-a-half. Young exacerbates the defense's dilemma by actually making those shots. He's converting 35.8 percent of his looks from 29 feet and out.A lack of size (6'1\") has not hindered his capacity to make plays inside the arc. He has perfected the arc and timing of his floaters and ranks in the 92nd percentile of finishing around the rim. His 9.3 assists per game are not the byproduct of how much time he spends on the ball but an accurate reflection of his vision. He beams one-handed dimes on the move before it's even clear he's picked up his dribble, confuses defenders by telegraphing one pass but throwing another and threads the needle against double-teams he's not supposed to see over.Atlanta's offense is not elite with Young on the floor (54th percentile), but it's subject to a monster drop-off when he sits—an 11.8-point-per-100-possessions plunge that ranks as the third-largest in the league among every player who has cleared 500 minutes.Put a more established supporting cast around Young, and the wins and losses should take care of themselves. He's averaging 29.6 points and 9.3 assists with a 59.5 true shooting percentage as the all-everything of an offense light on polished talent. Adding another ball-handler alone would go a long way, granting him an actual chance to work as a spot-up and motion shooter.In the meantime, he cannot be too harshly penalized for the constraints placed upon him by the circumstances under which he plays. He has outperformed the degree of difficulty attached to his role. So few players have ever balanced his volume with this efficiency—10 in league history, to be more exact: Adrian Dantley (four times); James Harden (four times); Michael Jordan (three times); Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (two times); Kevin Durant (two times); Larry Bird, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Karl Malone and Bob McAdoo.Slotting Russell Westbrook any higher would demand selective memory.Indeed, he turned a corner once the Houston Rockets steered into microball. He's averaging 31.0 points and 5.8 assists with a 57.5 true shooting percentage since Clint Capela left the rotation. Close to 56 percent of his field-goal attempts are coming inside five feet during this time, compared to 46.3 percent beforehand, where he's shooting 63.4 percent, up from 58.8 percent.It would not be a stretch to say this is the best version of Westbrook ever. The Oklahoma City Thunder never afforded him so much room to maneuver, not even during the Kevin Durant years.His downhill attacks are a different kind of terrifying—and almost impossible to stop—when he's not forced to navigate cramped spaces. He's even upped his accuracy from downtown, to 35.5 percent, while curbing his volume.Still, the first part of the season happened. Westbrook was on course for the fourth-worst true shooting percentage of his career prior to Jan. 1 while firing up far too many threes, during which time the Rockets failed to keep their head above water whenever he played without James Harden. Opponents outscored them by 4.3 points per 100 possessions, with a sub-105 offensive rating, through his solo stints.Westbrook deserves credit for flipping the script, even before Capela's injury and eventual departure. Since Jan. 1, Houston is pumping in 113.9 points per 100 possessions and posting a plus-3.7 net rating when he runs the show without Harden. But those returns have done yet another 180 since Jan. 29, when Capela last played for the Rockets.This level of inconsistency is unsettling. The Rockets are significantly worse off, both now and later, if they cannot count on Westbrook to successfully spearhead units without Harden. His most recent performance is proof he still has the impact of a top-25 player, but his top-15 case is no longer airtight. His average rank across six catch-all-metrics, in fact, suggests he should be lower—closer to No. 40 overall than No. 20.Bradley Beal exists in a gray area of superstardom.Merely having him doesn't assure playoff contention, which puts him outside the top-15-player conversation. And yet, he's also an offense unto himself, fully capable of crashing the All-NBA discourse in any given season. Pegging him as anything less than a top-25 player isn't an option.And to be clear, no one should want it to be.The Washington Wizards' hard-knocks season isn't on Beal. He's eclipsing 30 points and six assists per game with an above-average true shooting percentage, all while subsisting on a diet of difficult shots. James Harden, Kyrie Irving and Russell Westbrook are the only players tossing up more contested looks, defined as any attempt during which a defender is between two and four feet away.Granted, even without John Wall in the fold, Beal doesn't shoulder the same from-scratch burden many of his contemporaries do. Nearly half of his made buckets are coming off assists. But what he avoids in next-level difficulty, he makes up for with sheer volume. He owns the league's fifth-highest usage rate, trailing only Trae Young, Luka Doncic, James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo.Attributing his numbers exclusively to that volume undermines their significance. This isn't a good-to-greatish player stat-padding on a bad-to-terribleish team. The Wizards offense is optimized through his usage. They go from scoring 114 points per 100 possessions with him on the court (81st percentile) to 106.2 with him off (18th percentile)—a wrong-direction swing that typifies his importance to a team with zero first-option alternatives.Cue the annual \"Kyle Lowry is too damn high!\" pitchfork-carriers.Every time someone tries their hand at sorting the NBA's best, his name invariably appears in front of a few others who seem to deserve more due. How is he ahead of Russell Westbrook? Or Kemba Walker? It makes no sense.In actuality, it makes perfect sense. Lowry's value might even be underrated. He doesn't carry the largest load relative to other point guards or stars at large, but that's part of his charm. He routinely shape-shifts based on the Toronto Raptors' depth chart and lineups.Last year, this meant deferring shots and possessions to Kawhi Leonard and the rise of Pascal Siakam. In seasons past, it meant giving DeMar DeRozan the leeway to expand his playmaking portfolio. And this year—well, this year is some of Lowry's best work yet. He has juggled taking on more of the scoring burden without inhibiting Siakam's continued ascent.Few point guards afford teams so much wiggle room. Having the ability to splash in off-the-bounce threes, break down defenses, drill standstill jumpers and cover larger backcourt assignments while playing beside another smaller guard is different from actually doing it.Lowry doesn't dabble so much as he balances. He is an offensive chameleon. Look no further than his shot distribution. Almost 27 percent of his field-goal attempts come as spot-up threes. Nearly 31 percent, meanwhile, come as pull-up treys. He can both dictate and accommodate the terms of how Toronto plays.His case is only bolstered by the energy he expends on defense. He frustrates opponents in search of offensive fouls and has the stubborn strength to tussle with assignments much larger than himself (6'0\").There is likewise a Damian Lillard-esque air about the way he sets the tone, the author of both culture and identity. The Raptors defend and carry themselves like Kyle Lowry clones. He might not be Toronto's best player—though he was during the DeRozan years—but he is certainly its most important.The numbers support as much. He doesn't lead the Raptors in scoring. Or have their highest net rating swing. But his average rank across six catch-all metrics pegs him as the league's 21st most valuable player (and sixth-best point guard), putting him just ahead of Siakam (No. 26).The benefit of the doubt has assured Kyrie Irving a relatively high finish. And yes, he deserves it.Right shoulder and right knee issues have limited him to just 20 games. His season was deemed over before the NBA suspended play after undergoing surgery to address the former injury. This awfully small sample size cannot be discounted when assessing his value.Plenty of people will argue that Irving should be lower, if not left out altogether. Neither would be a totally unfair claim were we discussing the bigger picture. Murky availability has been a career-long problem, and it is fair to wonder how much worse off his teams actually are without him.Though the Brooklyn Nets have played shorthanded all season, they're still 22-22 when he sits, compared to 8-12 when he's in the lineup. And it doesn't help that the Boston Celtics have not just tread water but improved following his departure over the summer.Now still isn't the time to relitigate Irving's cornerstone value. Brooklyn is the first team for which he has chosen to play, and sweeping conclusions cannot be drawn until he's integrated into a healthier roster. Between injuries to him, Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert, in addition to the exit of head coach Kenny Atkinson, the Nets have not exactly been a portrait of stability.To what extent this falls on Irving isn't readily known. Atkinson's departure coupled with the usual dose of quixotic comments are, at bottom, instruments for debate. But drama and skepticism and health can only nuke Irving's stock if he fails to outstrip the collective concern on the court. That's almost never been his problem.This season is no exception. Through his 20 appearances, Irving averaged 27.4 points and 6.4 assists on the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career. He still isn't the guy you trust to reach the rim or get to the foul line in volume, but his off-the-dribble shot-making continues to bend the brain. He has buried 38.6 percent of his pull-up threes and rates in the 91st percentile of scoring efficiency as the pick-and-roll ball-handler.Small samples are conducive to noise, but for what it's worth, Irving has also proved to be a more consistent finisher around the basket in Brooklyn. His 65 percent clip at the hoop is a career high.Less debatable is the overall impact he has on the Nets offense. They score 6.4 points per 100 possessions more when he's on the floor, a swing that places in the 92nd percentile and is right in line with his on-off splits through five of the past six seasons. Brooklyn nearly gives everything back on defense when Irving plays, but his offensive credentials squarely put him among the NBA's most valuable players, even amid abbreviated availability.Before the hiatus, Rudy Gobert led the NBA in ESPN's defensive real plus-minus for the fourth consecutive season.He dominated the field in FiveThirtyEight's new catch-all, defensive RAPTOR rating, which incorporates box score numbers, on-off data and tracking data.His value there is so immense that he ranks fifth in the NBA in RAPTOR wins above replacement, behind only James Harden, LeBron James, Antetokounmpo and Kawhi Leonard, despite posting a negative offensive RAPTOR rating.He doesn't seem to have the narrative on his side for a third straight DPOY, but he clearly has an argument.Tune into any Utah Jazz game, and you'll almost certainly see multiple possessions on which a perimeter player dusts his matchup on the outside, gets to the paint and then does an abrupt U-turn upon seeing Gobert. It's a phenomenon that traditional box scores struggle to capture.The way to neutralize that, of course, is by deploying a modern 5 who pulls Gobert from the rim. He does a decent job while playing one-on-one out there, but simply having him out of the paint can break down a Jazz defense that featured only Royce O'Neale and Joe Ingles as clear plus defenders outside.That's probably the biggest knock against Gobert. As the Houston Rockets have shown, there are ways to game-plan around his dominance. His career postseason net-rating swing is minus-10.1.Generally speaking, though, he remains one of the most impactful players in the league. His plus-11.0 net-rating swing this regular season ranked in the 95th percentile. He's a devastating, dedicated rim runner, even when high-usage players like Donovan Mitchell don't throw the eventual lob. Just having Gobert attack the rim out of the pick-and-roll bends defenses toward the paint.He's also a staple on the screen-assists leaderboard, generating a league-leading 16.1 points per game off those plays.Put it all together, and it isn't difficult to see why Gobert is still one of the game's best centers, despite not having the guard skills most others have had to develop for survival.It isn't impossible to find a precedent for Pascal Siakam's career trajectory, you might just have to venture outside basketball.Going from 4.2 points as a rookie, to 7.3 points as a sophomore, to 16.9 points and a Most Improved Player in Year 3 is wild enough. Then, Siakam made being the first back-to-back winner of that award feel like a real possibility early in the season.Being elevated to the No. 1 option following Kawhi Leonard's departure torpedoed Siakam's true shooting percentage, but he's still 15th in the league in points per game (23.6) and is posting a slightly-above-average three-point percentage (35.9) on 6.0 attempts.This kind of production is a far cry from the projections of Siakam back when he was a borderline first-round prospect in 2016.\"To even think that I'm in the conversation, I have an opportunity to be [in the NBA], that's crazy to me,\" Siakam told Bleacher Report's C.J. Moore three months before he was drafted. \"For me, it's just about working hard every day and getting better. The thought of knowing that I might one day be there is amazing for me.\"Four years later, Siakam is an All-Star and the leading scorer for a 46-18 team defending a championship.And if that trajectory is any guide, he may not be done improving. The next step is merging the efficiency with which he played in a lesser role in 2018-19 with the volume he has had in 2019-20. If he does that, Toronto could remain a title contender for the foreseeable future.As for defense, there aren't many question marks there. The 6'9\" forward can ably defend multiple positions and rarely gets lost in the Raptors' scheme. For the third straight year, Toronto is surrendering fewer points per 100 possessions when Siakam is on the floor.Is there a more plug-and-play superstar than Paul George?Perhaps out of depth as the every-possession No. 1, he has dominated while working off another primary ball-handler in each of the past three seasons. That's not a given for everyone of his stature.Better players would struggle when having less granular control over the offense. Paul's game is made for that balancing act. It is seamless.Displacing him from the ball gives you one of the league's most dangerous standstill shooters. He has ranked no lower than the 74th percentile of spot-up efficiency through the last five seasons.Tasking him with from-scratch creation leaves you with a viable source of offense. George's 53.2 effective field-goal percentage when shooting out of the pick-and-roll is the 10th-highest among 56 players finishing at least five such possessions per game, and his 38.2 percent success rate on pull-up triples ranks fifth out of everyone firing three or more per game.George distinguishes himself from players who wear similar hats by virtue of his role allocation. He can spend more time as the de facto No. 1 than most other sidekicks. He is at home swishing jumpers after coming around ball screens, even if his turnover woes out of the pick-and-roll are closer to the rule than the exception.\"Playoff P\" is both a laughably lame name for his alter ego and an actual thing (last year's five-game letdown against Portland notwithstanding).Don't bother arguing that George belongs any lower after missing a bunch of time with right shoulder and left hamstring issues. This is his conservative finish. In any normal season, his context-proof offense and All-NBA defense—playing next to Kawhi Leonard hasn't spared him from pestering the best 1s and 2s—earns top-10-player consideration.Ben Simmons' finite offensive range is problematic in that nearly 90 percent of his attempts come inside eight feet. He doesn't even have break-in-case-of-emergency touch beyond there. And yet, his limitations are far from crippling.Simmons has the speed and size (6'10\") to thrive amid his own shortcomings. He's still in the 93rd percentile of finishing around the rim, and defenses remain inclined to collapse around him when he's going downhill.It is within this chaos that Simmons' passing IQ shines. He is a drive-and-kick whiz and has the floor awareness to hit trailing shooters and sling dimes to the corners. No one has assisted on more three-pointers than him, according to PBP Stats.None of this is license to entirely ignore the elephant in the room. Simmons' jumper-less repertoire is an issue, and there seems to exist a clear disconnect between him and head coach Brett Brown, who so obviously wants his 23-year-old superstar to branch out.The operative word here is \"superstar.\" Simmons is flirting with the pinnacle of his profession while skirting one of its most sought-after skills. That speaks to everything else he does, particularly on defense. He can lock down lifelines for entire games.Nobody in the league qualifies as a more versatile defender. Simmons has spent at least 17 percent of his time guarding every position on the floor, save for center, according to Nylon Calculus' Krishna Narsu. And among every player who has logged at least 1,000 minutes, only Terrance Ferguson and Royce O'Neale have racked up more reps against No. 1 options.Reconciling Simmons' offensive sins is admittedly tougher this side of his five-year max extension. Superstar pay grades come with increased scrutiny and less patience. That the Philadelphia 76ers offense is slightly more efficient with him off the floor this season cannot be written off. But it can be contextualized.Philly took an already unevenly built roster last summer and leaned into the awkwardness. Simmons' drawbacks aren't new. The Sixers knew who he was when they maxed him out and surrounded him with too little shooting and neither enough ball-handling nor spacing to explore what he can do away from the action. That he's come so far despite his team working against him in so many ways is a testament to his value.The list of players who had a better offensive box plus/minus than Karl-Anthony Towns' 4.8 through five seasons is short (and impressive): Michael Jordan (7.9), LeBron James (6.2), Vince Carter (5.4), Chris Paul (5.3), Nikola Jokic (5.2), David Robinson (5.2), Charles Barkley (5.1) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (5.0).He isn't quite the passer LeBron, CP3 or Jokic were right off the bat, though his career-high 4.4 assists per game this season shows progress, but Towns' hyper-efficient scoring arsenal makes him perhaps the game's premier big-man weapon.Stephen Curry is the only player in league history who matches or exceeds Towns' career marks for points per 75 possessions (24.4) and true shooting percentage (62.2). To get that level of scoring prowess out of a 5 is likely unimaginable for other organizations.And despite missing much of the season with injuries, Towns has shown he's still developing.He's posting career highs in points (26.5), assists (4.4), made threes (3.3) and effective field-goal percentage (60.0). No one has ever had a season that matches Towns' 2019-20 combination of efficiency, volume and rebounding.Progress on the defensive end seems to have stalled for Towns, though. Minnesota allows a whopping 6.2 more points per 100 possessions when he was on the floor. Opponents' effective field-goal percentage is 3.4 points higher when he plays.His defensive rebounding and shot blocking (1.2 per game) provide value on that end, but he still loses focus far too often and is regularly caught out of position.But there's no question his offensive contributions outweigh the defensive shortcomings. For the fifth time in five seasons, the Timberwolves' net rating is better with Towns on the floor.Every so often a superstar's decline is not just exaggerated but invented. It is talked about as a matter of fact when, in reality, it has yet to begin.Such was the plight of Chris Paul entering this season. The Houston Rockets treated him as the less valuable player in their trade for Russell Westbrook, and the Oklahoma City Thunder tried to reroute him upon arrival. Some of this recurring reservation was precautionary. Paul is an undersized point guard (6'0\") on the verge of turning 35 and owed $85.6 million over the next two years. Time is a friend to neither his ability nor price point.Viewed against those concerns, Paul's situation was still overblown. Even when presented with the disclaimer that the Thunder might keep the core intact past the trade deadline, they did not begin the year as a consensus playoff contender. That aloofness is atypical of a team built around a fringe top-10 player.Just so we're clear: Paul absolutely remains a fringe top-10 player. His 17.7 points and 6.8 assists per game don't leap off the page, but they come on tough-to-fathom efficiency. He is posting the second-highest true shooting percentage of his career and has been Kevin Durant automatic from mid-range, where he's connecting on 53 percent of his looks, another personal best.Paul continues to take great pleasure in cooking bigs off the dribble when they switch on to him, and he is still a defensive bulldog. Even more impressive is the extent to which the Thunder thrive by leaning on him. Their offensive rating improves by 13.7 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor, the second-largest such swing among anyone who has logged at least 250 minutes. (Of note: Danilo Gallinari, his teammate, is first.)This dependence carries over to crunch time, where Paul leads Oklahoma City in usage rate by a country mile. He's slashing 53.5/36.0/93.8 in the clutch, which is just silly. Among every player with similar usage who has made at least five crunch-time appearances, only Joel Embiid owns a higher true shooting percentage, which is even sillier—and the core reason why the Thunder are 29-13 in clutch contests.When he's engaged, Joel Embiid shows flashes of Rudy Gobert-level defense and Karl-Anthony Towns-level offense. Though probably a little shy of both comparisons, when combined, Embiid looks like he might be the best center in the game.He's shown an ability to step out and hit threes or dominate a post-up like Towns. And his rim protection and recovery speed is elite in certain defensive possessions. But he struggles to consistently provide that level of play on both ends.Even with ebbs and flows of effort, though, his 23.4 points, 11.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.3 blocks in 30.2 minutes per game impress.And for the fourth straight season, the Philadelphia 76ers' net rating is better with Embiid on the floor. His defensive-rating swing ranks in the 94th percentile, which is somehow a career low.One thing he never struggles with is an ability to get to the line. Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Embiid's 10.1 free-throw attempts per 75 possessions trails only Shaq's 10.4.That's why his true shooting percentage is always above average, despite a 51.4 effective field-goal percentage that falls shy of the 52.2 average during his career.When Embiid gets the ball, his mind often seems already made up to attack. And officials often can't help but blow the whistle.Getting all those scoring possessions at the line has a compound effect. Embiid's free-throw percentage yields around 1.6 points per two-shot trip to the line. And each whistle gets the opposition closer to the penalty and foul trouble.Embiid can be a great defender, floor spacer and post player, but his most consistent, valuable contribution might be that foul-drawing ability.Among players with at least 50 post-ups, Embiid leads the NBA with 1.12 points per post-up possession. But that's buoyed by the fact that he draws shooting fouls on nearly a quarter of those possessions. His effective field-goal percentage out of the post ranks 16th, right behind teammate Ben Simmons.  The process to get here wasn't always smooth, even after a standout rookie season in 2017-18, but Jayson Tatum is now the guiding force through which the Boston Celtics play. It is on the back of this progression that he's entered superstar territory.Skeptics like to harp on his efficiency. His 56.2 true shooting percentage is below the league average, and he's banging in his mid-range jumpers at an unspectacular clip. Calling him erratic or unreliable still equates to misinformation.Relative to his shot quality, Tatum has actually outperformed expectations, according to PBP Stats.Among everyone attempting at least three pull-up triples per game, only Damian Lillard and Caris LeVert are downing theirs at a better clip. Nikola Jokic is the lone soul who has converted more looks inside four seconds of the shot clock, and Tatum's 55.7 effective field-goal percentage in these situations ranks first out of 104 players who have 50 or more relevant attempts under their belt.Having another scorer, aside from their point guard, so comfortable creating something out of nothing is a boon for the Celtics offense. They've more than doubled his pick-and-roll volume accordingly. And in recent months, he's parlayed that additional responsibility into more volume around the hoop.Tatum's playmaking does still trail expectations for someone in his role. He has the lowest assist rate of anyone with his usage. But the feel for throwing less obvious passes is there, and he's proved capable of carrying league-average offensive units without Kemba Walker. His assist totals should approve with repetition.Through it all, Tatum has maintained the seamlessness of his offense. He hits a ton of self-created threes, but almost half of his overall shots come off assists. He dominates with his escape dribble and step-back three; he preserves his fit next to everyone else with his spot-up touch and opportunism in transition.This says nothing of his defense, which is borderline All-NBA-caliber. Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart streamline his workload by chasing around the glitziest assignments, but his help around the basket and free-safety gambles are one of the Celtics' most precious defensive devices.It is no accident Tatum owns their largest net-rating swing (plus-10.9). His two-way impact is their foremost building block.The Milwaukee Bucks need a second star.Scant few takes have become more outdated than this one. Reductive disclaimers haven't aged much better.Khris Middleton isn't a traditional No. 2 option.What in the what does that actually mean?Maybe the influx of superteams and superstar free-agency pairings over the past decade has restricted the criteria for sidekicks on championship contenders. That's fair enough and perhaps a legitimate problem for the Bucks given the teams they most likely must get past in prospective Finals matchups.Except, well, it shouldn't be considered an issue right now. If Middleton didn't qualify as a genuine star before—and that's a big if—he does this season.Middleton is tied with Damian Lillard for the highest true shooting percentage among everyone averaging more than 25 points per 36 minutes, a list populated almost exclusively by, you guessed it, consensus superstars. But it isn't just these numbers. It's the method by which they come.Misrepresenting Middleton's place in the league usually begins with the assumption that he's the benefactor of Giannis Antetokounmpo's world domination and the Bucks' floor balance. Who wouldn't thrive playing next to the NBA's reigning MVP, inside four- and five-out lineups? Milwaukee's environment no doubt glitters up Middleton's role, but it hasn't made him in full.Self-creation is ingrained into his game. He runs pick-and-rolls into pull-up jumpers. He shoots over mismatches in isolation and from the post. Tough fadeaways are business as usual. His off-the-dribble three is deployed in small doses but remains effective. He is the secondary playmaker everyone's waiting for Jayson Tatum to be (which, for now, gives him a clear, albeit slight, edge over Boston's fast-rising linchpin).In fairness to his critics, Middleton lacks a certain preponderance. His game still stalls out inside the arc, where he's neither strong nor explosive enough to live at the basket. A career-low 15 percent of his looks are coming at the rim this season (7th percentile).Beyond that, Middleton has all the trimmings of an offensive nerve center. The Bucks aren't the Bucks without their capacity to navigate minutes sans Antetokounmpo. Middleton is central to that independence. Milwaukee outscores opponents by 8.1 points per 100 possessions during his solo stints with an offensive rating that ranks in the 94th percentile.Ebbing offensive efficiency is a threat to Jimmy Butler's place in this exercise. His 24.8 percent clip from three is the second-lowest of his career, and among 111 players attempting at least three pull-up jumpers per game, his 33.8 effective field-goal percentage ranks...110th.To his credit, Butler has supplemented struggles from the perimeter with relentless assaults on the basket. A staggering 43 percent of his looks are coming at the rim, his highest share since 2012-13. Defenses are still inclined to overreact when he gets going downhill, and he is an expert at both creating and finishing through contact. He ranks in the 100th percentile of shooting foul percentage.Butler has further counteracted his spiraling outside clips with additional playmaking. His 6.1 dimes per game are a career high, and he places inside the top 25 of potential assists. The Miami Heat are at their scariest when he's captaining fast breaks.Even in a down shooting season—his crunch-time splits aren't pretty—Butler has proved to be more than essential. The Heat need every ounce of the pressure he puts on defenses off the dribble. Goran Dragic and Kendrick Nunn are the closest they come to face-up alternatives, which won't cut it. Miami's offensive rating takes a nosedive whenever Butler is on the bench.And more so than anyone else, Butler deserves credit for keeping the Heat afloat on defense.They started fizzling by December but have stayed above board when he's in the game—no small ask given how much time he spent in lineups with three negative defenders prior to the trade deadline. Playing beside Bam Adebayo, Mr. Happy Feet himself, barely qualifies as a luxury under those circumstances.This season was always going to be a test of Butler's stardom—of whether he, at age 30 and independent of another top-25 player (Adebayo isn't there...yet), guaranteed his team a playoff spot. It turns out he does.Year 1 as a Los Angeles Laker couldn't have gone much better for Anthony Davis so far.His per-game numbers of 26.7 points, 9.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.4 blocks and 1.5 steals, in concert with L.A.'s Western Conference-leading 49-14 record, has AD all the way up to fourth in Basketball Reference's 2019-20 MVP Tracker.The chemistry between him and LeBron James—who trails only Giannis Antetokounmpo in that tracker—seems instantaneous.The Lakers are plus-10.4 points per 100 possessions (95th percentile) when AD and LeBron share the floor. LeBron passing to AD is the most prolific assist combo in the league. And the three-time champion has had no issue deferring to Davis when both are in the game.In those situations, the big man's usage percentage is 26.7. And he trails only Joel Embiid and LaMarcus Aldridge in post-ups per game.The knock against Davis, of course, is that the Lakers are minus-0.9 points per 100 possessions when he is on the floor without LeBron. And the defense is dreadful for those possessions.That may be a bit nitpicky, though, as his time in New Orleans probably taught us he's not the kind of player who can singlehandedly carry a team to above-average play.Instead, he may be the absolute best No. 2 (he still trails LeBron in usage) in the NBA.Damian Lillard's superstar stock is aided by the anecdotal perhaps more so than any of his peers.This isn't to imply he doesn't have the statistical credentials. He absolutely does. His 28.9 points and 7.8 assists per game are career highs, and they come on a personal-best true shooting percentage (61.9). Larry Bird, James Harden and Michael Jordan are the only other players to hit those benchmarks for an entire season.Really think about it, and this is sort of absurd. Superstars in their prime reach new peaks, but the means by which Lillard has gotten there is different. He has improved incrementally almost each and every season, adding new wrinkles to his game at a stage of his career when many are settled in their ways and focused on maintenance rather than expansion.Getting swept by the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the 2018 playoffs motivated him to improve his decision-making versus double-teams. This year, without a big who can flip up shots and toss passes out of short rolls, he has diversified his own pick-and-roll package. And his finishing around the rim, while still below league average, is more bankable than it has been in most other years.All this time later, Lillard remains the NBA's closest approximation to the best version of Stephen Curry. No one is better on super-deep threes at the moment. He leads the Association in attempts from 29-plus feet, where he's shooting a bonkers 41.1 percent. And where others offer a reasonable facsimile, Lillard noticeably separates himself with an actual defensive motor and, most importantly, a certain plug-and-playness.Someone like Trae Young doesn't yet have the luxury of a secondary playmaker who invites him to relinquish control, but you could see other megastars, such as Luka Doncic or James Harden, suffering unintended consequences if tasked with deferring too often. Lillard's style, similar to Curry's, is inoculated against that wart.And yeah, in the grand scheme of things, his intangibles matter. He's among the players who make you believe the clutch gene exists, even when his shots aren't falling. More than that, he is the master at cultivating and preserving culture.For most teams, bringing in both Carmelo Anthony and Hassan Whiteside would've been a notional heat check. For the Portland Trail Blazers, it was business as usual, thanks in largest part to their top-10 superstar and emotional bellwether.What you're about to read might sound like hyperbole, but I assure you: Nikola Jokic is on track to be one of the best centers in NBA history.Among players with at least 5,000 career minutes, Jokic ranks sixth all-time in box plus/minus, trailing only Michael Jordan Jordan, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Magic Johnson and David Robinson.Before the league was suspended, he was averaging 20.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, 6.9 assists, 1.2 steals and 0.7 blocks in just 32.3 minutes per game.This is his fourth season (he's only played five) with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and six assists per 75 possessions. No one else has more than three such seasons, and Russell Westbrook, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic and Kevin Garnett are the only players in league history to have at least one.Oscar Robertson and Magic, both of whom averaged more minutes and played in eras with a faster pace, are the only players in league history with more triple-doubles than Jokic before turning 26.The Serbian center fills up stat sheets like few players ever have, and they're not just empty numbers. This season, his plus-9.2 net-rating swing ranks in the 93rd percentile (he's never been below the 89th percentile).Before he was selected first-team All-NBA for 2018-19, there was a robust debate over who the game's best center was. With each passing year, Jokic makes it harder to argue against him.Even at seven feet tall, he is functionally Denver's point guard. His vision from anywhere on the floor is unparalleled. He can lead a break or pick apart defenses in the half court. And his passing repertoire is outrageous.He has absurd touch as a scorer, particularly on flip shots and his patented Sombor Shuffle. His footwork in the post hearkens back to the days when big men ruled the league.Defensively, Jokic gets a bad rap because of the lowlights he finds himself in when switched on to much smaller players on the perimeter. No, he's not the most fleet of foot. But generally speaking, he's in the right spots defensively, knows how to take up space without fouling and actually has a very good steal rate, thanks to deceptively quick hands.Denver has allowed fewer points per 100 possessions with Jokic on the floor in each of his five seasons. During his career, his 1.9 defensive box plus/minus is tied for ninth in the NBA.He is, at the very least, an above-average defender. And when you combine that with all-time great offense, you get one of the best players in the world.Can someone knocking down under 32 percent of their threes really be one of the NBA's most valuable shooters? It turns out yes.Luka Doncic's game is not the least bit inefficient. It is just a different brand of efficiency. His 31.8 percent clip from deep comes on absurd volume—9.8 attempts per 36 minutes—and incomprehensible difficulty. Only James Harden and Damian Lillard take a larger share of their triples after using seven or more dribbles, and he's fourth in points scored off unassisted treys, according to PBP Stats.Both the volume and difficulty on Doncic's threes act in service of everyone else. The mere threat of his step-backs and parking-lot range invites defensive attention commanded by, maybe, seven other players. The Dallas Mavericks' league-best offense improves by 4.4 points per 100 possessions when he's on the floor (83rd percentile), not by chance but by the openings his long-distance volume creates and the ridiculous on-the-move passes he flings.Awarding Doncic top-five-player status is not an overreaction to his sophomore climb. He has amplified his game to the distress of opposing defenses. His step-back gather is more nonchalant than that of Harden, and he's gotten better at leveraging it into opportunities inside the arc. He's more effective at keeping defenders on his back hip, and he mixes changes in direction with shifts in pace to keep helpers on tilt. (It'd be nice to him mix in more of this variety during crunch-time situations.)This variance in attack has coincided with souped-up finishing. Doncic is shooting 73 percent at the rim (94th percentile) and 57.4 percent on all-two pointers. His flip shots are deadly when he's going downhill, and he's pieced together a strong situational post game.That he has both honed and expanded his offensive bag while shouldering even more responsibility is patently ridiculous. Dramatic upticks in volume tend to come at the price of efficiency. Doncic's true shooting percentage has actually jumped roughly four points from his rookie season even though his usage rate has spiked by 6.5.Combine all that with almost unparalleled vision—he's already one of the league's seven best passers—and he has an ironclad case as one of the NBA's top-five players. And he hasn't even technically entered his prime.If watchability debates were a metric for value, James Harden would have no fewer than three unanimous MVP trophies sitting on his mantle.Opinions of his game don't actually matter. The aesthetics are open for interpretation. The results are not. Harden has unlocked an alternative means of sustaining efficient offense. He burns through more isolations than entire teams and has standardized the use of step-back threes. The Houston Rockets don't even go through the trouble of sending that many ball screens his way anymore. He doesn't need them. His 1.22 points per isolation possession are the equivalent of a league-best offense on their own.Sitting through this brazen of an approach can be grating for those with no vested interests in Houston's well-being.The possessions aren't always long—the Rockets are second in average possession time, per Inpredictable—but they can be monotonous and, anecdotally, seem to last forever. His search for three-shot fouls and four-point plays is frustrating, if only because both its success and failure lack a consistent baseline. The way he chases—and exaggerates—contact on drives to the basket is equally infuriating for similar reasons and because of what it does to the pace of play.Say what you will about the look of it all, that it's gimmicky or not in the spirit of the game. The Rockets, in their eyes, have spotted a market inefficiency, and they've elected to ride it, repeatedly, to title contention. Playoff flameouts open them up to criticism, but jockeying for a top-three regular-season finish in the Western Conference every year is nothing to belittle.None of it's possible without Harden. He has broken regular-season defenses, not unlike Stephen Curry, only on the back of harder-to-love extremes. Focusing too much on the pretense of Harden's invention risks underselling the significance of what he's doing: scoring like hell, to the tune of 34.4 points per game on unreal efficiency.For anyone who can't appreciate that, perhaps they can at least muster affection for his playmaking. Harden has achieved absolute awareness in the half court and throws some of the league's most mind-meltingly difficult passes.Because, obviously, scoring like hell isn't enough.Kawhi Leonard's best-player-in-the-league case keeps receiving convincing bumps.Winning a second title and Finals MVP last year was the peak of his argument. That he wound up leaving the Toronto Raptors partially added to the intrigue. This wasn't him emerging from the shadows of his Hall of Fame teammates. It was him spearheading an entire championship push in a one-off situation while playing through a left knee injury that became progressively worse as the postseason soldiered on.Not that he needed it, but Leonard's second title legitimized him in a way 2013-14's banner year never needed to, a measuring stick for just how unfathomably far his offensive game had come. The Raptors put him at the center of their universe, and it worked.Leonard's performance this season, on yet another new team, has amplified his cause, resetting his career peak once more. The Los Angeles Clippers opened the year leaning on him for extreme pick-and-roll usage. That volume has come down from its initial high, but it still makes up roughly one-third of Leonard's offensive possessions, by far and away the largest share of his career.Cooking more initiation into his routine has given way to the long-anticipated playmaking surge. Leonard doesn't toss the same fancy-schmancy passes James Harden and LeBron James do, but he's successfully leveraging the chaos he inflicts into gimme opportunities for his teammates.Defenses regress into ataxic clutter when he maneuvers inside the arc, and so many opponents are predisposed to show double-teams as soon as he catches the ball outside the rainbow. The attention he draws, verging on panic, is the turbine Los Angeles uses to power its offense. Leonard is averaging a career-high 5.6 assists per 36 minutes, and the Clippers are scoring 116.8 points per 100 possessions (93rd percentile) when he plays without Paul George and Lou Williams.Driving an entire offense as the primary facilitator is Leonard's final frontier, the last step in his quest, be it deliberate or incidental, to become the NBA's most complete player.His progression as a scorer already gave him a stake in that conversation before now. He swishes pull-up mid-rangers on autopilot, and his bullish drives to the basket render defenders who aren't built like houses mostly helpless. His off-the-bounce three is on the come-down, but teams still respect it, and he remains lights-out off the catch.That someone can be so utterly assertive on offense—30.0 points per 36 minutes on 58.5 percent true shooting—while guarding at an All-NBA level is beyond comprehension. Leonard doesn't exhaust his defensive stores on every possession, thus creating negligible separation between himself and Giannis Antetokounmpo. But the engagement and resolve he's sustained for the latter half of this season are truly, totally terrifying.LeBron James' will should be showing signs of erosion at age 35—something, anything, that suggests he is exiting his prime.So much for thatFor whatever reason—and there are many—he seems further away from his twilight than last season. Whether it's the arrival of Anthony Davis, the Los Angeles Lakers' proximity to a title, a disdain for the push to inaugurate Giannis Antetokounmpo or Kawhi Leonard as the league's best player or some combination of everything, LeBron is carrying himself with a renewed sense of purpose and swagger.That fresh approach is most evident on the defensive end. He isn't checking fellow superstars every night, but he's openly more engaged in the half-court. His close-outs on shooters have more pep, in that he's actually closing out on shooters, and he's fighting through screens with intent, enough to help Los Angeles coax ball-handlers into long mid-range jumpers and keep them from working the corners.Much is made of the Lakers offense in LeBron's absence, and correctly so. They are short no fewer than one ball-handler. But the defense has, statistically, suffered more when he's off the court. That's not telltale of anything groundbreaking. It also isn't purely a function of his spending so much time beside Davis and Danny Green.On offense, meanwhile, LeBron still emits inevitability. What he wants to do gets done.Just as he developed a post game in Miami and added a step-back three into his ammunition depot last season, he has decided that now, in Year 17, is the time to win the league's assist crown. It is this added influence over the offense that allows him to hold off the stars most closely at his heels—namely Kawhi Leonard.Players have rarely churned out 25-point, 10-assist detonations so regularly, much less at LeBron's age. He has six years on anyone else who maintained those averages for an entire season. What he's doing now isn't natural. Yet watching him, it looks and feels organic.In truth, that's LeBron's career arc in a nutshell. He has normalized, even numbed us to, what isn't. Someday, he'll cease contending for MVPs and best-player-alive honors. That time isn't now. What's more, it doesn't appear to be on the horizon, either.This might be the easiest call of this project. Giannis isn't just the NBA's best power forward in 2019-20, he is having an all-time great campaign, regardless of position.His 11.5 box plus/minus is the ninth-best single-season mark in NBA history. LeBron James (three times), Michael Jordan (three times), Stephen Curry and David Robinson are the only players with better seasons by that mark.And while the per-game numbers—29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.0 steals and 1.0 blocks—that underlie that box plus/minus are eye-popping, they still don't do this season justice.Like Curry and the Golden State Warriors in 2015-16, Giannis hasn't needed to play a ton of minutes for his team to put games away early. For the season, he is averaging just 30.9 minutes per game.His per-75-possession numbers—32.9 points, 15.2 rebounds, 6.4 assists, 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks—are literally unprecedented. And no one's all that close.That seemingly impossible individual production for a 53-12 team suggests Giannis should win MVP in a landslide. The aforementioned tracker agrees.For the reigning winner of that honor, the real prize might be Defensive Player of the Year. If he secured both awards, Giannis would join Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players in league history to pull that off.In addition to his 12.7 defensive rebounds (first this season and third-most all time), 1.1 steals and 1.1 blocks per 75 possessions, Milwaukee allow 11.3 fewer points per 100 possessions when Giannis is on the floor, giving him a defensive rating swing that ranked in the 98th percentile.For further context, the Bucks allow just 97.7 points per 100 possessions when Giannis plays. The league average defensive rating this season is 110.4.Not only is Giannis one of the most nightmarish (for opponents) point forwards the league has ever seen, he's a versatile defensive anchor who can guard multiple positions.If his still-developing jump shot ever truly arrives, it might be impossible to even imagine a 4 more perfectly suited for the modern NBA.      Unless otherwise noted, stats courtesy of NBA.com, Basketball Reference or Cleaning the Glass.Andy Bailey and Dan Favale cover the NBA for Bleacher Report.

According to a new Morning Consult poll, Curry is the most-liked player among NBA fans heading into Tuesday’s tipoff of the 2021-22 season.More on the numbers:The player favorability survey was conducted Oct. 8-12, 2021, among 360-431 self-identified NBA fans per player, with a margin of error of +/-5%. The vaccination sentiment question was asked in the same survey, among 2,200 U.S. adults, including 987 self-identified NBA fans, with margins of error of +/-2% and +/-3%, respectively.Alex is a senior reporter covering the business of sports.\n"
